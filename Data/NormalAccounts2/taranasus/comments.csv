Tried running Forza Horizon 3 on this thing, it was a nightmare. CPU went up to 100% and started dropping frames faster than the Germans over London. I have a 970 in here, quite a nice card, usually handles most stuff I throw at it, but if you so much as tickle the CPU the wrong way, the card is useless. At the very least get a fx-8350 but that's only a temp solution. Unfortunately you will have to get a new CPU, so do I. It sucks but such is life.

For me, immersing myself in the game and actually being in that world is a big thing so it makes a lot of sense for that. It's also great for moving around and not sitting on your ass all day. Games like AudioShield and Holopoint are great fun but require a hell of a lot of physical movement.

Now for 130 you will get a lot of stuff: 65 different types of classes, swimming pool, three types of saunas, and whatever else fancy you can think of. The thing is you will never use al 65 classes, and all 3 saunas and the swimming pool as you are just one person.

Similarly for £130/month you can LEASE A BRAND NEW CAR. Hell you could get a regular gym membership for like 35-40 quid which still has a pool and a sauna and maybe 12 different types of classes and still be left with 90 quid / month to lease a very small car like a citroen C1. 

Obviously option two is a lot more financially sound. You get more for the same amount of money. But people's priorities are not logical (unfortunately) so they will be spiteful when they can't justify their actions.

I remember having a discussion with a designer friend (I'm a developer and games developer myself). I was complaining at how expensive a VIVE is and that I have to save up to buy one. She tells me that she thinks its absurd that I'm willing to spend so much on pointless technology (£730) especially since I have other VR headsets in the house. Then she goes out the next week and buys and iPad pro which was at the time just released (£899). When I bring up the point that she already has a graphics tablet for her design works I'm met with ""You don't get it, this isn't a pointless toy like that VR dohicky"". 

She's right, I really don't get it...",2016-08-25 15:01:25+00:00,d6w4xu9,4.0,t1_d6w1alw,5112.0,AskReddit

""But then all platforms get angry because of delays""

Okay, then how about we don't call it a delay, but when deciding on the release date, they add a +6 months extra at the tail of it for bugfixing, then the game releases bug-free and on all platforms at the same time

""Yes but then the studio will run out of money and its 6 extra months of paying developers with no gains since people will buy them buggy anyway""

Sooooo how about we stop buying buggy games?

- On the one side it's the fanboys that are defending it and taking it too far. I've seen some really crazy pulled out of the back-side defence arguments for the game. There are threads in /r/NoMansSkyTheGame subreddit asking people to go away and stop talking about the game if they don't like it and can't accept it for what it is. Criticism is good, don't censor just because you don't agree.

- Then we have the disappointed. People that were having crazy / unrealistic expectations of this game and when it fell short went on a rampage. ""Two people can't see each other in the game, Sean is a lire and must be punished for making false claims!"" ""Look at Sean deflecting our questions, you owe us answers fool!"" ""Omg another fucking delay, i'm canceling my preorder BAAAHH HUMBUG"" ""OMGWTFBBQ werz mah 60fps you promissed!""

- And finally there's the anti-fanboys that for some reason are trying to tare the game to shreds and would like to see it burn in the fiery pits of hell because it was overhyped. They never had any intention to try the game, but because it was so widespread and talked about they kept hearing about it and have developed a hatred for it.

He certainly has good, even excellent arguments. The ocean being 1 million miles wide and 3 feet deep is a good explanation of procedural generation.

But I am looking for something light-hearted and easy(ish) on my brain, something to zombie out on. This kind of looks like it. Maybe the mining/crafting system is a chore and dull as bricks but maybe I'll enjoy that. Turn off my brain point a gun at something and repeat that for 20-odd minutes until I can jump to the next planet. 

Or maybe I'll find it repetitive as hell after 3 hours exactly, can't claim back the money I spent on it and I'm down 40 quid, but it's 40 quid I can risk loosing at this point.

141,"Do not quit your current job, its much easier to find a new poaition when you're already hired (ironic i know, but the interviewer will be wondering why you would put yourself in financial hardship to find a new position).

Make a nice CV that stands out while still looking professional. Hiring managers get 30 CVs a day that look the same, they appreciate it more if your CV is well designed and different because you made their job a little more entartaining. Then just post you CV on job boards and start applying for positions that you think you'll fit. 

Next you will start receiving calls from recruiters. If you work in IT you will receive a LOT of calls. These guys work on comission from the employer based on the value of your salary. It is in their interest to get as high a salary as possible to maximize their own income.

After that it's pretty much riding the wave. See what they offer, if its something you'd do and pays 5K more go to the interview and boom you got 5k more per year. Stay with that company one or two years and then start all over, unless the company decides to scale your pay competitively which very rarely happens.

You can't sleep because you constantly have on your mind the things you haven't done yet, and you want to get them done so that you no longer thing about it, so you can get relief.

164,"You really have to consider what targeting means in game development. Just because you've set yourself a target of 60fps for your future title doesn't mean you're actually going to hit that target.

A lot of things can intervene and make it worse, things that you didn't take into account performance-wise which makes your frame-rate plummet. 

In this case I think that 1.6GHz CPU the PS4 has is a massive limp for what NMS needs. They have a lot of assets to generate based on math, on the fly, in front of the player. The faster the player moves, the more it needs to generate so the more calculations the CPU has to do. Now of course you can spread multiple assets across multiple CPUs to generate them in paralel, which I'm sure thy already do, but once the CPU is fully utilized on different assets you can't make it go any faster and that's where the 1.6GHz clock speed really starts to hurt. It just can't make objects fast enough for the speed that you're going it. 

Now sure, on-foot this would not be a problem, and could easily run at 60fps (probably) but that wouldn't be the case when flying around at normal speeds. So instead of having 60fps on the ground, 30fps flying, 15fps flying really really fast on the planet surface, they just went with 30fps to provide the most stable experience possible.

Combat is amazing and satisfying being well carried by a very detailed upgrade system. There are multiple ways to customize how your ship and weapons behave in order to adapt tl your play style.

The scenario is pretty linear to be honest: jump to system, kill enemies, take loot, jump to next sector before big ships come and whipe the floor with ya. If i wasn't rushed through every sector by the impending doom of those battle cruisers I might stay arround and explore some more.

Performance wise is okay but there is room for improovement. Shooting minable asteroids can cause the game to temporarily freeze. Shoot a minable ore rock with a flank cannon and you'll see what I mean. The VR side still requires a hell of a lot of work untill it is ready.

Graphics are superb on the other hand, top notch job on them.

Overall I think really good progress. Can't wait for the next patch

192,"No... just no Microsoft... you remember Google Glass? Why are you trying to repeat past mistakes.

Make the technology more accessible and then retail... christ...

EDIT: I see my point has been misinterpreted.

I'm not saying that glass = hololens. One's augmented reality, while the other was a notification system. My point is the device itself is way to expensive and not mature enough to be on sale.

As a dev kit, it's good for development but very few companies will have the $3000 required to invest in such an experimental device. A device that currently has a very narrow FOV. Think about the fact that a VR headset has an FOV between 90 and 105, and that seems restrictive. 

Microsoft it definitely going in the right direction with the HoloLens, but this is nowhere near the device that's going to launch AR. You can't justify the price-tag for something that just covers a portion of your view area. 

$3000 and it covered most of your viewing area? That's understandable, but it currently has too many flaws to cost this much. ",2016-08-03 07:39:52+00:00,d627nlr,1.0,t3_4vwx88,8456.0,oculus

Now talking back into real-world terms, the few people that have actually pre-ordered due to leaks I'm sorry to say, but you've actually changed nothing.

The game would have been the exact same regardless of these leaks, so weather you've seen the video 10 days in advance and pre-ordered, or seen the video on launch day and ordered it one day late, the outcome is the exact same, you still would have bought it because the game is the exact same game regardless of the scenario. 

And as for HG, the fact that they have your and everyone else's 40 quid 10 days in advance makes absolutely no difference.

Think about it like this: you make pancakes, and they taste really good. They are not the best pancakes ever but they are pretty tasty and special, ranking very high up there. 

You tell everyone in the office that you are going to make them all pancakes and they taste amazing, and everyone gets excited because pancakes.

Then Jill from accounting, who's already tried your pancakes because she's visited you once starts telling everyone in detail all the things that are wrong with your pancakes forgetting to mention at the end that ""they are still pretty good tho, but i just wanted to highlight all the negatives"".

Now all the people in the office are all like ""wtf, you trying to poison us with your shitty pancakes, and i was so hyped for them!"" Even though they never fucking tried them... they are just listening to Jill.

Think about it: The game has been sitting at the top of the steam charts for quite some time now. It's obviously already selling really well and has a ton of pre-orders. At this point, sending out early review copies won't bring them any sort of benefit will it? Those that want to wait for reviews will get them post-launch, there is not incentive to pre-order since there is no advantage to starting early (mostly single player game) so at this point what does HG get from sending out early review copies?

However the reviewers stand to gain a lot if they can post reviews pre-release date as it brings them a lot of views (see IGN). It is very possible HG signed some sort of deal with IGN in which they don't send out review copies in order to offer them viewer exclusivity. 

I'm not saying what they are doing is correct, but from a business stand-point I can see why they area not sending them out, it makes no sense for them to do so. ",2016-08-02 22:03:33+00:00,d61mwuk,1.0,t3_4vsk5z,29001.0,pcmasterrace

263,"Completely understand, and I also very much understand your fear of a potentially hurtful organization that could be just disguising as the EU.

However my point of view on this matter is choosing the lesser of two evils. I'm intelligent enough to see through the bullshit that both parties were spewing out but I'm nowhere near smart or resourceful enough to do a full analysis of the EU and come to an educated conclusion about it's motives. 

I know one thing about small systems, they are much more easier to take over by bigger systems. Our decision to leave the EU is supported by Donald Trump (who let's be honest, is about as poor of a leader as you can get), Vladimir Putin who has only to gain from a broken up Europe and ISIS of all things (if the media is to be believed). I'm not fond of company in this camp at all. Yes we left the EU and not NATO, so technically speaking we're still in the peace-keeping alliance without being in the economic one, but this stunt is not going to be seen very well by our neighbors for causing them and ourselves problems. 

And of course, Canada is a peaceful country, and most other countries, but peace is not the only factor here, it's prosperity and the UK has been prosperous under the EU, we don't know what's going to happen next.  

However I can't dismiss your point either, the EU is looking more undemocratic and we don't know how far that's going to go. Then again you could say the same about he UK (England, Scotland, Wales and N Ireland) where all the decisions are taken in London, all the money revolves in and around London and the rest of the kingdom not doing so great, probably why Scotland and N. Ireland want to leave. Then if you think about it it's not full democracy here either, as the queen can dissolve the government if she wishes too, sure it may cause an uproar but the option is there. Maybe it's a little unfair to call the EU undemocratic in this circumstance since the UK is not ideal in the current way it's being run?

The more I keep thinking about it, the more complex it becomes and the more confusing which is leading me into a circle of thought to no end.

But I do know that this referendum was done badly, unplanned and not for the correct reasons, with a whole nation about to suffer the consequences of some lying politicians (as always). 

I think we're all being fools about this. We're all spending our time blaming each-other like idiots for the outcome of a referendum we didn't fully understand and couldn't comprehend, that was poorly explained to us at best, instead of seeking answers from the arses that held it in the first place and hold them accountable.

It all kind of boils down to how the campaigns were run throughout the country. The leave campaign needed support from patriots because they knew they didn't have a chance in a logical debate. They said they wanted to stop immigration without ever taking a look at how it's benefiting the job market. My gf is hiring for a senior Automation QA position in London, they have received over 20 candidates, not one of them is English. Then there's the problem that leaving the EU doesn't actually stop immigration. It hinders EU nationals to immigrate yes but what about the commonwealth countries? That doesn't change.

Games are life simplified. A rich person doesn't want more money because it makes his life easier, to them the numbers in the bank account are the scoring system. Geocachers collect caches, just to say they've collected them, that's their points system. Facebook likes on a photo are the same, the number of friends you have are the same. We all do some sort of activity to measure ourselves against others. 

You think you're so different than the book-a-holics? Nope just different mind drugs for different types of people.

""BUT I WILL HAVE SPENT MY LIFE AND ACHIVED NOTHING"" - well sort of. On the one hand all of us do. When Richard Brandson is dead he isn't taking viegin atlantic with him to the grave, an he probably won't know how beautifull the map in uncharted 4 is either because he's too busy running a multi billion dollar brand, which i peomise takes up all of his time. My grandma will probably die soon and she will have never seen VIrtual Reality, on the othe hand I can hope in my Core Dynamics Vulture, and go stare at different stars for hours through two magnifying glasses with a screen attached. 

Yeah I'll probably never get to drive a Camarro from the 70's, but most owners of Camarros will never get to enjoy using a smarphone to trun on their car and have it warm by the time they exit the building. 

What I'm trying to say is: your life your rules. If gaming makes you happy, play games. Yeah set aside an hour or two a week to explore other passions or hobies if you are not fully satisfied but don't be ashamed of what you like. At the end of the day when your life's over you can say that you felt almost first hand what it was like to grapple onto a plane mid-air without getting a scratch, and that's something nothing else but gaming can give you.",2016-06-13 17:12:43+00:00,d47j1m6,2.0,t1_d47b0lv,10835.0,AskReddit

You can say that about any following of anything. Have you seen football fans (soccer to the americans)? You disagree with them and you might end up with a broken nose.

Thats how popularity works, there will be some people praising the subject in question without logic or reason just because they have a genuine obsesive liking for it. 

That being said, those people are just a minority and the casual fans, like myself, are here for the fancy fan art and news updates.

383,"**Project title - Void 21**

**Promotion Type** - Exposure and awareness

**Promoter's name and role** - Taranasus / Taranasus Studio - I am the developer, designer, etc of Void 21 and Co-Founder of taranasus studio. This is our very first game and as you may or may not know, raising awareness is difficult when nobody's heard of you. So we're trying to get the word out
**
Links to the project** - http://www.void21game.com/  http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550/?snr=1_5_1100__1100

**Explaining the project:** Void 21 is a little bit of runner, a little bit of bullet hell, and a lot of adrenaline rush. The idea came from my own frustrations with a very similar title, Race the Sun, which while a very good game has very sluggish and unresponsive controls which makes it really difficult for no reason. With the wish of a fair challenge I started coding this in my spare time to then move into full-time development and build a limited company around it. 

While the general consensus is that it's a really nice game, with very little in terms of negative feedback (feel free to check steam reviews and youtube reviews), that is not enough to actually get the game into players hands, to at least look at it! So we're now in the search for ways to give it more exposure.

I hope you'll at least have a look at it and let us know of all of your thoughts :) If you have any questions I highly encourage you check out our [past AMA](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4gz1xv/iama_games_developer_that_has_used_his_savings_to/) first, and if you don't find the answer there, ask away.",2016-05-16 13:51:28+00:00,d37gnqz,1.0,t3_4jkgx2,13680.0,IndieGaming

395,"Thank you, and to answer your hunch from the dev perspective: 

This type of graphics, like the monument valley and my own game: 

Mobile devices are a very curious beast. The rich people have high end devices and that's great! But the not so rich people that maybe don't care to have a $700 brick in their pocket have slightly less powerful devices. When we make mobile apps we need to take this into consideration and decide: Do we want to make a realistic super-fancy game that will require a high-end phone to run, or a simple graphics game that will run on more phones but runs the risk of not being as impressive? 

Going for the high end option, it takes more work, more money to make, has a narrower audience and will have to cost more. So you're forced, as a studio, to either go down the route of charging $7-$10 for your game and mostly nobody will buy it, or fill it to the brim with microtransactions and capitalize on cash cows (see Real Racing 3). Not a very... fun and exciting thing to do and to an indie developer like myself it isn't even an option as I lack the experience and resources to do something like this (and the cheek to actually use microtransactions)

The low end option is a bit split in two: You can either make a 2D game which won't be very taxing on the phone itself and allows you to have a BIIIG audience, or you can make a 3D game with very basic graphics, but a few rendering filters on top to make it look shiny. Mounument Valley, Stack and even my own game employ this technique as we want to make a nice looking 3D game without requiring the users to have a laptop on their person at all times. 

The music is another example that plays into the exact same thing. I have a different game I made for the PC which costs 10 dollars, and for which I hired a composer to make our soundtrack. It cost us 2000 euros for 5 songs, 4 minutes each and that is actually very cheap for the market but I'm hoping to gain return on that investment through sales... some day... With Super Stacker, I just got [this thing out](http://piano-player.info/), switch my computer to record all sound that was coming out of the speakers, then pressed some keys until something sounded good. Mind you I'm no musician, I'm a shitty Bass player at best, but it's enough knowledge to get some amateur 5 second piano song put together. 

Now if I wanted to make money out of super stacker, I can't charge $10 for it. Heavens it took a week to make and cost me maybe $200 in total, but if I was hell bent on making a profit there are quite a few options: 

- Ads: if you can find the right balance between making some revenue and not being a spamy arse (*cough* stack *cough*cough*) it can bring quite a bit of mullah back your way as it gets big
- Fremium: Give the base game for free and add some tiny microtranscations in the game for like say an extra skin for something in there or anything cosmetic.
- Paid: While it's not worth $10 it maybe could be worth $0.50 if you don't have assholes like me giving it away for free. It's a small enough sum that if a potential customer decides they like your app, they wouldn't mind shelling out a lollipop for it. 
- Donation button: This is a method I'm using for Super Stacker but I'm not really publicizing it in the app anywhere. Basically you can have a donation button in the app so that if someone likes your game enough they can support you through a pay what you want system. Since I'm not intending to make a profit, the donation button is hidden on my website in the game's about page as I don't want people to support me unless they robed a bank or something and the cash is burning a hole in their pocket.

398,"I did. You can learn all sorts of tricks if you know people in QA.

Install an add blocker on your phone and you permanently fix the problem of ads per say. But then you're left with the moral question. While I'm not a particularly big fan of ads, the developer put them in their app for a reason, and that reason is because they're probably hungry. Indie game devs make very little revenue off of their titles, especially on mobile. 

I was watching a talk recently with the guy that made ""A Dark Room"" for iOS with his partner. Their game reached all the way to the 1# RPG, and #10 top app at some point on the apple store. In a year they made about $700,000 revenue, which sounds like quite a lot. But then you take 30% off because apple's cut, then you take another %45 off because income tax, and then they split the money and we're left with $134,750 over a one year period each... after being that high in the rankings!

I'm not going to talk about my own income but sufficient to say it's much much lower than that. So I don't want to install an add blocker as I'm literally robing them of their revenue stream... kind of similar to piracy if you think about it. But then there are soooooo many ads in some of these apps that they suck all the enjoyment out of them, so I rather not play them because while the developer still receives no money from me, I'm not benefiting from the enjoyment they potentially provide through their game either. 

That's my take on the matter anyway.

399,"Thank you, and a it is a fair question. The reason is two-fold:

First: I wanted a simple game that I enjoy playing while waiting at the doctor's office or on the train, etc. I was playing Stack made by Ketchapp before but the number of ads in that thing is just ridiculous. Seriously I want to enjoy your game, you're killing me here! So I set out to make my own for myself to enjoy. It was cute for a while, very unpolished cause only I was using it but hey it worked. However I got bored playing alone, I mean what's the fun in making a super awesome tower if you can't share it with anyone.

So I said sod it, let's give it a nice coat of paint so it's not horrible to look at, ad a share featurem some leaderboards and hike it on the store. It's still mainly for me but if other people want to play it with me they are free to do so. 

I'm also sure there are a lot of people out there that could really use a game with no ads or microtransactions: Think of parents that want to keep their kid quiet in the car without loosing $200 worth of in-game currency. Or maybe peeps like me that are perfectly happy with their brand of cleaning product and don't want/need to know about all the competitor choices out there.

Second: I'm also a ""professional indie game dev"" (that sounds so retarded to say out loud...). I have a new studio and I want to get the word of my existence out there. I already have a paid title but nobody knows of me or trusts me, so why would they buy it? That's perfectly legit, I mean I don't give out my money to randomers on the street claiming they support some charity or whatever, why would I give it to some dev I know nothing about? So one way to spread the word is to do everyone a service, give it for free and if they like the game / me enough they might read up on my past and buy my other game. 

What do you think? Is that a reasonable approach on the matter? This is all very new and experimental to me. I launched Super Stacker yesterday and woke up to 30+ five star reviews. On the one side it's not much but on the other it's not 0 reviews or just 1 stars.",2016-05-15 14:03:18+00:00,d36b0mt,2.0,t1_d3698mo,4262.0,AndroidGaming

Sweet, screenshot and all right? I'll make a ticket to have the file access request removed.

&gt;Can I recommend you put a splash screen up explaining permissions before asking for them. Otherwise it looks a bit dodgy.

You can certainly recommend it but if we remove the access to files permission are the rest of them that unreasonable? I mean all it needs is internet access and it's pretty obvious that the game has leaderboards in it.

&gt;Similarly, the game works without Google Games (or whatever it is called) installed.

Correct, It's been coded that way. You don't care about leaderboards, that's perfectly fine it will work without them. However the permissions the app has to request from your phone all sit in a file called the androidmanifest.xml file. Once I compile the app, the permission will be in there regardless if it's needed or not and if you're running android 5? or bellow (can't remember in which one they implemented on demand permissions) it will have to get that access regardless if it needs it or not.

&gt;how do you get the realignment of the entire tower? seems like 8-10 in a row?

8 blocks in a row

&gt;the piece i lost on had the animation and sound for a good landing, but it fell at 108 still. is that intended?

That is intended, you can have a good landing but if the piece is to small and narrow to remain standing it will fall off regardless. 

&gt;edit: also, it takes the tower a long time to do the white animation and align itself. kind of boring to wait for it. i dont know if i need to align the new block to the latest block or the soon to be aligned tower.

I'll have it tweaked so that it moves a little faster then. Thanks :)",2016-05-14 19:51:55+00:00,d35jwn5,4.0,t1_d35j5nm,1343.0,Android

426,"You have to match the block at an exact 90 degree angle from the block underneath it. This could be 0, 90, 180, 270. I give you visual cues at 180 and 0 but don't give any at 90. When you match it at 90, or 270 the block will spin into a position that's better suited for the tower stability (0 or 180).

450,"&gt;The whole equal rights thing meaning you are a feminist is a way of combating the stereotype of the rabid man hating SJW that exists in many corners of the internet. It's basically people just saying that they don't want all men to be killed, they just want to be treated the same as anyone else.

Then why don't they say just exactly that? Why don't they just come out an say ""Feminism is not about killing all men as some more vocal, misinformed members of the community would have you believe, it's about women obtaining the same rights as men"". 

But what are the rights that this modern group of feminist are lacking is what I'm trying to understand. Which countries are they targeting? So far I'm hearing about a lot of ""privelage"" that males are getting over women yet I've failed to see a concrete answer as to what these privileges are.

All civilized countries have equal opportunity laws, there is no such thing as a rape culture, it's illegal almost everywhere on the planet with severe punishment for all that actually commit it and I've never in my life heard one person actually encourage rape. The wage gap doesn't exist as it's been proven countless times. Women have, actually, a lot lesser restrictions in what they can ware in both formal and informal occasions and are generally treated with priority depending on their situation (mothers with children board planes first, women get helped with their luggage, etc).

I'm not saying mac is a joke of a gaming platform... where have I said that? 

&gt;I just want to jump in and ask why you think Linux will take off at all, given the following:

Because with Valve jumping in with Steam OS it's no longer just a community of enthusiasts contributing to the development of linux. There is actually a company, with profit in mind, that is wanting and needing Linux to succeed. They also can't back out of that venture easily without screwing over a lot of hardware manufacturers that have already created Steam Machines. 

And now with Microsoft going down the path of UWP, valve don't really have much of a choice but to use Linux (or at least get it ready as a backup) should Microsoft decide to lock down windows for gaming.

It's a slow transition, as always, but one that will most probably happen if I, together with all the other enthusiasts and business keep helping it.

482,"&gt; Could you elaborate why and how this is different on other platforms? How do you know its an issue in your code or the game engine code on Win/OSX?

With the closed OSs it's a lot less likely that the problem is going to be within them and their drivers. If we're talking Windows, so many people use it that a quick google search is bound to give me the result I'm looking for, as most likely someone has run into the same problem before me. 

If that shouldn't be the case, there are so many users with experience in the platform that just asking the question on a forum is going to yeld me a result faster.

With Mac OS, while the above statement is not as valid, there are only very few hardware variation that the game is going to run on. Thus the chances of the driver or the OS having a problem are significantly lower due to their limited variation. 

On Linux: In Ubuntu the game was running slower because Unity (the ubuntu unity not the game engine) uses 3D acceleration which would use more resources than necessary. 

In Lubuntu, the sound didn't bloody work. Just in my game tho', it was fine with everything else

In Xubuntu, everything kind of worked but the CPU would lock up every now and again for no identifiable reason thus far. And the sound while functional, sounded terrible (unlike in Ubuntu).

In Crunch-bang (!#) it worked fine apart from the occasional ""Cannot detect your resolution"" for some ungodly reason. 

And Steam OS after updating itself went into a reboot loop because why not. 

In all of this Anti-Aliasing didn't work because the Intel driver didn't support it for some reason.

I've had... None of these problems on either Linux or Windows. So yeah while I do love Linux a lot, I want a complete rewrite sometimes :D

Oh and almost forgot about the stereoscopic rendering bug. Even though it is a setting that only affects VR users, and even though it's not used in the Linux version at all. If the checkbox was left checked it would crash the game. This is an engine bug as opposed to a Linux bug of course, but it was only happening in linux, most probably because the Unity3D player is not tested as extensively in Linux as it is in the other two platforms.

Stereoscopic rendering was causing the Linux version of the game to crash. While this was technically a bug in the Unity player, like you pointed out before, I was expecting it to rebuild and just work as the Mac version was running without any sort of problems.

Resolution detection on some versions of linux is flakey. Sometimes it would detect it correctly, sometimes it would go to 640x480 for no reason. God forbid you have a multi-monitor set up as it will stretch out the game on all three monitors without any warning. Still looking into a way to fix that as it's more of a engine bug than a my code bug but in the grand scheme of things that matters very little.

The fact that it's open source helps in the sense that there are other people that can easily have a look and fix whatever the underlying issue is if it's not in the game itself, however they have no obligation to do so either. 

It's the fact that linux is open that made it so fragmented and all over the place. Not to say that open source is a bad thing, it's just a normal consequence of its existence.

498,"&gt;I've got some questions for you, hopefully you're still answering:

I have a minute of break so sure why not :)

&gt; Would you say going all in on indie game development is a risky thing to do?

It's about as risky as you make it really but probably less risky than a manufacturing business for example since the start-up costs are quite small to non-existent, depending on your approach. 

Big risk number one: you make a bad or uninteresting game. The downfall of this is pretty obvious, nobody's going to buy it. If you're EA or UBISOFT you can get away with making a bad game and still getting sales from it, but probably not enough to cover the development cost. If you're starting out, it's most certainly not going to cover your development cost

Big risk number two: You make a Good game, but not an Excellently unique and outstanding one. This I think is where void 21 stands right now. I personally think it's a very good game for a runner/gunner but let's be very real here, it's not a Stanley Parable. Or maybe it is what do I know? The risk here is that even though your game is good, and people will rate it as such (as per our steam page and the reviews scattered around the internet) it's not special enough to do its marketing through word of mouth, so you have to do it actively. Failing to do so will cause your title to go into obscurity and you get no sales.

&gt;How much experience in programming (I'm assuming C# since it's Unity) did you have before you started on this project?

Quite a lot of experience, I've been coding in C# for 12 years now. But don't let that discourage you because I've been using C# for gaming only for the past year. There is no correct answer to ""how long should I study coding before I get into game Dev"". This game for me has been a learning experience, the's no prerequisite. My best recommendation for you and your brother, start off with a pet project that you expect to fail. It will teach you enough so that your next project will be successful. Don't invest much money in it and maybe don't even try to sell it. It is very possible that it turns out in the end that it's good enough to sell, in which case well done but it's much better to make one that you don't really care about, fail at it just so you learn the lessons of the trait and then your next project be something you truly want to release out into the wild.

This of course doesn't mean ""make sure you fail"", it's just a way to learn from your mistakes faster. We've made a lot of mistakes along the way from Void and we won't make the same ones with the next title, but now it's hard to actually get it off the ground. 

&gt;Good luck in the future with your games :)

Thanks and good luck with your future business!

Trust me, none of us do, we're just doing the same exact thing and pretending to know what we're doing to project confidence.

&gt;I wish I was more involved in games, as it is a huge passion of mine but I know I would get the eyerolls from parents / family etc. and have no real direction as to where to start or what I would be good at.

I don't talk to my parents much for this exact reason. Even if they are completely right, what I'm doing is dumb and will end up with me having to rebuild everything I've thrown away, this has been one of the best time-periods of my life and should I lose everything for it... I'm just going to get a job, save more money and do it all over again.

As for where to start? There's no right or wrong answer. I started by getting an Oculus DK1, then decided ""Hey it would be cool if i could make like the most basic 1st person jumping platformer and play it on my new toy"". Did some googling, found Unity3D that supported the oculus even back then and just started doing a tutorial on Unity3D. 

Anywhere's a starting point, just dive in and don't give in to the feelings of frustration and confusion. They will be there! Take a break when you're overwhelmed and try again the next day. Slow progress is better than no progress.

The return on my dedication is getting me 10% of what it's getting the company I work for so what is all of this for?

So I quit, I chose my passion and potential poverty and maybe even bankruptcy to be happy. I didn't over analyze it because I knew that whatever I would plan for at the time I would predict poorly. I've never done this before and planning for it would have achieved nothing. 

I don't have a family to support, and don't own a lot of things. The worst that could happen is I'd run out of money and have to find a job again... big deal... I have no loans to pay, no commitments made so there's no real risk apart from just loosing some money. I'm young I can make it back quickly If I wanted to, but that's not what I want.

I chose happiness and recklessness over security and misery, and so far it's turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made even if it blows up in my face, because for the past months I did exactly as I wanted, and If I fuck up I'll gladly get a job, raise more money, and do it all over again.

531,"Allright I'll go into detail.

C# is a fairly new and modern language that works on top of the .net framerwork, or in Unity's case on the mono framework (which is pretty much the same thing just open source and free). Because it's on a framework it has some advantages, the biggest being that you don't have to worry about managing where your variables are stored in memory, if they overwrite each other, if they have been de-allocated back to the operating system, if they can pose a security threat by being accessed by viruses to inject code into your application. 

Aside from that, because it's on top of a framework it also comes pre-made with a lot of helper classes and methods that just allow you to achieve your objective faster. You need to get the absolute value of one of your variables? Math.Abs and you're done.

There is an endless list of other modern features that just make it overall easier and faster to use but because it runs on top of the framework, it's biggest advantage is also it's biggest weakness. You cannot access the hardware directly. Everything you do HAS to go through the framerwork and has to be supported by the framework. 

C++ is at the other end of the spectrum. It's old and well established. It talks directly to the hardware and thus you have to manage every aspect of that communication through your own code, otherwise you're not going to crash your app, but potentially the whole computer that it's running on. But with this great liberty, provided you know what you're doing, you can use the hardware to its full potential. Hell write your own game engine in C++ from scratch, everything's possible. 

However, mastering it takes a hell of a long time. The reward is high, but the effort invested is quite high as well.",2016-04-30 00:57:07+00:00,d2mtcse,4.0,t1_d2msugw,826.0,IAmA

Because I wanted a runner with super tight controls, gun mechanics and upgrade systems. Ta-daaaa

Gun mechanics in a runner game + the fact that it doesn't try to be difficult by making the mechanics difficult. Also it's not endless, you can go through the same levels and perfect your strategy as much as you want

&gt; Did you worry about the genre being crowded?

Not really. Sure I could name a few 3D runners. I couldn't name one with gun mechanics in it and a proper upgrade system. Yeah it's not a brand new concept of game, it's just trying to push the genre forward by enhancing it and borrowing elements from other genres.

&gt;If I may ask, what was your old job?

My last job was web solutions architect which is short for ""We want you to Project Manage, Code, Manage People and Interface with customers at the same time""

&gt;How was your experience with getting your game on Steam?

Incredibly easy. Got green lit in 11 days and that was it. Did a Reddit post about it which saw a little bit of exposure but really steam itself did most of the traffic. Just make a really pretty greenlight page with animated giffs and a good video and you're golden. 

&gt;What software do you feel you'll be replacing by something better (e.g. possibly Photoshop instead of Paint.NET, game engines etc.)? Are you happy with Unity?

Windows 10 with Linux once Unity support it properly. Unreal or Cryengine once I can get a bigger team to justify using more complex engines. 

&gt;Living in a country where the game development industry hasn't really kicked off and there aren't many places to advertise (nor gaming conventions) what would you say is the best way to advertise? Maybe planning a trip to a conference in another country? If so, what are some good entry level conferences?

Honestly advertising on social media can be done from anywhere and it's your most predominant exposure method. The fact that you live in a country which doesn't have a gaming scene (and hopefully lower rent, lower living expenses all together) makes it easier to survive once revenue kicks in. 

Coming to a conference is more important for you as developers than for your exposure. You can meet other developers, make connections and find important bits of information that most people wouldn't be comfortable disclosing on the internet for one reason or another. Hell you can probably get the same effect just going to the event as a visitor and just talking to the devs and companies there but I can tell you giving interviews and having a booth is a lot of fun. 

&gt;Since I'm a programmer, I expect to have a similar position to yours (at least until I find another developer). What could other people with no programming background do in order to be involved? What aspects other than programming are there (e.g. advertising?) What skills would they need to fulfill those roles?

3D modelers, sound engineers, musicians, image editors, marketers, QA engineers. Just search those positions and you'll figure out pretty quickly what skills they need + the burning passion to worship our lord and savior! Videogames!",2016-04-29 20:11:56+00:00,d2mihdf,2.0,t1_d2mhtlc,914.0,IAmA

1. Because I enjoy it
2. Because it's a creative art that I like

625,"Hello me from 10 years ago! How have you been?

But on a more serious note:

&gt;Even if I figure something out, how can I know if any given language I decide to pick up will benefit me in that sense?

You speak English right? English is made of a combination of German and French words with some grammar twists. So is pretty much every other language if you follow the path long enough. Some have some more bizzare grammar rules added to them but in the end they all function the same. If you learn the particularities of each language and the words that are new to you you'll speak that language. And then the more languages you know, the easier is to adapt and learn a new one. Programming is like this but easier as it's all in plain English and it was all made in the last 40 years for the most part. 

&gt;I always assume I'm thinking too much on it and should just go in with the idea of something like, ""why not recreate Pacman?""

You have your answer right there. But I can also see your quarrel: ""Why would I just make something that's already made? That's boring... I want to make something new because that's not boring!"". Go on udemy and find a tutorial for any game engine and or programming language, stick with it for a while then once you get bored try something else.

Appart from that, don't use your BEST, ULTIMATE game idea as your first project. That's like giving your awesome idea to an inexperienced developer and then being shocked it didn't turn out the way you wanted or at the level you wanted it, even if that developer is you.

Start of with some tutorials in your proffered game engine and learn how to use it. Then make at least 1 pet project from start to finish, something simple. It could be a break-out clone, it could be a something unique but keep it simple.

And then get to work on something you'd feel comfortable releasing comercially. Don't get me wrong even pet project number one may turn out to be so good you can release, and that would be awesome, but keep your own expectations in check.

I've been playing games since I was 3. That's 23 years of playing and at some point 2-3 years ago VR hit... I was so captivated about the possibilities that I wanted to make my own worlds. Here's the start towards fulfilling that dream!

&gt;How long have you been programming in Unity?

2 years now I think

&gt;What exactly does a quality assurance and UX guy do? From the description it seems you are doing everything from business to developing the game.

Hahaha these guys are like the hidden warriors behind the quality of your product. They will tell you when a menu is too confusing and will suggest how to make it not confusing and easier to use, they will point out the small yet very annoying things and force you to fix them. I am the guy wielding a hatchet and I can make an ugly log cabin with that hatchet, but then the UX and QA guys come in and help me make it a pretty cabin that's cozy and hommy and such. When you work on something for a long time, you become used to its small problems that you don't notice them and then you ship a buggy and unrefined game. User Experience is what makes that unrefined game into something that puts a smile on your face and makes it FEEL RIGHT.

&gt;How long did it take to develop this game?

Dude, it's in the title :))

&gt;On which platforms will this game be released?

It's out on Steam for Windows. Linux and Mac joining the fight on the 4th of next month and we're looking at PS4 XB1 and PSVR over the next few months (hopefully)

&gt; What are some mistakes you would not do if you were given the opportunity to go back in time?

Promote earlier! Like the very second I had an ugly screenshot, PROMOTE THAT! It's really hard and time-consuming to create a fan-base.

&gt;The gaming market is pretty saturated, So what are your long term plans?

Saturated? My friend but this is just the beginning! The gaming market is about to explode in the world of VR. There are plenty of things left unexplored. Go to a games convention and walk through the indie section, you'll be floored at how many unique and interesting games are being made right now.

&gt; Did you find it hard to get into the industry/gain support?

Nope, most people are really kind and helpful, at least the ones I've met. You really just need to ask for most things and you'll get them. /r/gamedev and /r/unity3d are awesome places to get advice and feedback. 

Can't really speak for how it is to get hired as a gamedev by another company. I tried with only one studio and they never replied to me so that was a bit of a downer. Oh well you win some you loose some. 

&gt;Do you have any previous kind of experience in software development or design?

Yep. I've been coding for 12 years now (since I was 14). I've worked as a web developer and then as a solutions architect. I'm quite versed in a lot of a languages but coding skills are not what make a good game dev. They certainly help but you can do so much more with some basic modeling, sound engineering and image editing skills. 

&gt; What do you think of courses that are dedicated to game design/development?

I'm sure they are very useful technically and they may even provide some insight on how to start your own software house business but I doubt they can keep up and prepare you for this ever-evolving market. They're definitely a good starting point, but be prepared to brutally discovered that you maybe know just 10% more than the guy that didn't do the course. Then again I never did a degree in game dev so I may be extremely wrong.

Follow a beginner course on udemy or something similar in your engine of choice. Once you're past that, make yourself a pet project, doesn't have to be anything complex, that you can finish to see how a game actually grows from 0 to something.

So here's a quick summary on how to promote your game. We didn't do that good of a job ourselves initially but we've learn a lot and doing a lot better now:

1. Start early. Seriously, like ""this is a cube on a plane"" early. If the screenshot is good enough to show to your close friends, it's good enough for the internet. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Reddit start as early as you can so people know who you are when you launch

2. Reply to all of your comments and feedback. Say thank you to everyone, even the critiques. Be polite, kind and just ignore the trolls. ""Your game is awesome!"" ""Thank you"" ""Your game is meh, it'd be better if it had this thing tho"" ""Oh wow, good idea, thank you. I'll look and see how I could do that and if it'd work well"" ""Your game sucks 1/10 IGN"" Don't say a god damn thing. They are just trolls with nothing constructive to say, DO NOT ENGAGE
3. Ask for help! /r/gamedev are awesome, /r/Unity3d are awesome. They will try and help you as long as you've done your googling before hand.
4. Before launch sign up to http://keymailer.co and start sending your keys out to youtubers and twitch streamers. If they like your game they will help you promote it but be prepared for a very very very low response rate
5. Keep working on your title after release, get it on as many stores as you can if you're doing pc
6. Want to do a console port? Literally just ask. I would like to bring Void 21 to the PSVR so I went on the /r/PSVR subreddit and asked ""Who at Sony can I contact to talk about this"". Got a twitter account, then got an email exchange and the rest is now on-going.

664,"&gt;Hey, I remember the release of your game. It was a big hit on several of the subreddits I frequently visit. Congratulations on the release.

Thank you, we're actually extremely happy people like the game :D

&gt;What are the main things that you focus on in the game development process?

Mechanics as programming is my main strength. I wanted the game to be super responsive, super smooth and overall I personally feel that we've achieved this quite well. On my GTX970 it runs at 4K200FPS. Currently working on some minor frame drops that happen due on the fly texture loading and adding a very slight motion blur effect to make it feel even smother. [Here's what it looks like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmvivDjSq-Q) with the new motion blur effect on my current dev build. It's almost perfect :X

&gt;Have you ever/How do you come to that decision where you are like ""I need this title to be a success so I need to invest everything I have into it"", in the hope that people will accept the game?

I didn't. My drive was the passion I have for videogames and actually working in the industry and in VR. If this were to fail, I'd just try again later down the line. Investing everything I have into it is actually really easy, It's what I want to do. In my head gaming should be an experience that surpasses every other art form by light years but it won't do that with ""Cinematic Experience"" and 30fps720p, basically random limitations set by other more established art-forms. 

I'm here to try and push boundaries and explore the unknown. Maybe Void 21 doesn't do that fully yet, but one day something I make will. I'm basically doing it because it's what I want to do.

&gt;How hard was it to actually differentiate your game from the massive amount of indie gaming titles that are now coming out and also at such a high level?

Hard, and honestly while it does have some interesting aspects to it and pushes some new concepts (like having a runner style game with gun mechanics or bringing back wire-frame graphics) it's still not at the level of uniquness I know I can make. But that will take time as I'm still very green indeed. 

Was it hard? Not really... I didn't focus on being unique, I just wanted race the sun with tighter controls in the beginning, then this happened. 

&gt; What advice would you give to anyone who is intending on doing games development full time? In terms of what you need to actually expect.

As an indie, expect to not do that much development :))

As an employee for a gaming company, especially a big one, expect them to force you into long working hours because they exploit your passion for your work. Yes I know how grim that sounds but do a google search and you'll see what I mean.

As an employee of an indies studio, expect long hours of work in a very friendly and wacky environment filled with nerf guns and trips to the pub. 

It's an amazing industry to work in, but it's a very demanding one filled with long hours but high rewards. 

Identify your strengths, nourish them, and your weaknesses understand and explore. Understand what each individual part of the game creation process does (Graphics, Modeling, Texturing, Sound music) on a basic level so you can understand their problems as well, it will make you much better at what you do if you can tailor a solution around their needs.

668,"Tough one! It's very dependent on what you want to achieve. My honest answer? Start off by yourself, alone, and see what you can do for yourself.

Pick a tiny tiny tiny project to do (maybe a phone app or a free game if you can spare the time and money) and see what you're good at, what you're bad at and what you can learn to do.

Here's my story in a nutshell and you can use that as kind of a template:

I started off by myself, I knew how to code and some very basic 3D modeling + very basic image processing skills. That was it. However my partner in crime and life used to be a tester at EA and agreed to help me with the polish and testing so that's two more areas covered. 

As I started work and things started falling together I realized that hey, games need sound! How do I sound.... GOOGLE HOW DO I SOUND? Oh Audacity to cut sounds, here's a small video tutorial on how to use it... alright then but now i need sound files... Google ho... oh there are free sound samples out there, and a tool to make 8bit sounds for free. Cool let's play around with those.

But then I needed music! Music is important, as it keeps you game-flow going. Learning to do music wasn't gonna happen, it's not a simple thing to do it's an art in it of itself. This is where it becomes important to have contacts. Through a friend he linked me to a guy that did music for one of his game, and a couple of thousand euros later we had a sound track. 

The point I'm trying to make is that there's no secret formula. You're not like me, I'm not like Notch, everyone is different and different things will work for different people. You need to kind of dive in head first, identify your strengths and weakness and then try and find methods to fill in the weaknesses. 

So plan of action (as I see it anyway, feel free to adapt to your needs)

1. Pick small project to see what you can do
2. Identify based off of the project what you can do, what you can't do and who to contact to help you on the cant's
3. Do second project with what you've learned and the people you've met
4. Profit

&gt;and get it steam green lit? 

Make sure it's decent quality and start growing your social accounts early. Facebook, twitter and youtube (and even reddit ;) ) and show off your game. Every time you have a new screeenshot, video, whatever post it on your social channels so people get interested and start subscribing. This way when you hit green light you have an establish fan-base that will vote for you to pass it quickly.

That being said, I passed greenlight in 11 days without doing what I've said above and without reaching the top 100 games on green light in order to be accepted. To this day I don't know why that happened, I'm just happy it did. ",2016-04-29 15:53:40+00:00,d2m6w0d,2.0,t1_d2m63rq,1054.0,IAmA

670,"I have a few answers as well :P

&gt;What engine did you use for this?

Unity 3D, currently on version 5.3.4p2. Waiting for 5.4 to be released

&gt;What tools did you use for the art?

Blender for 3D modeling. It's awkward as hell to learn, but that's a small drawback compared to the things it can do... It's just amazing. AND FREE

Paint.net for image editing. I didn't need to do anything too crazy when it comes to texturing so something lightweight and simple was awesome for the task. Through a plug-in it also opens PSD files and again, free as free can be.

If you need something more complex for image editing, GIMP which is also free but quite a challenge to master and can be clunky at times.

AudaCity is awesome for sound editing and again free as free can be

&gt; Do you have any advice for someone who wants to quit their job and do their own projects?

Quite a bit of advice:

1. Make sure you have enough money to carry you through. Be it self-funding or a loan or a publisher or a kickstarter make sure you have enough. The more you need to worry about financing the less you can worry about making a quality game

2. Start promoting early. I've said this before in here somewhere but as soon as you have a screenshot that can be shown, create the necessary social media accounts and show to people your progress. ""But I wanna make games""... yeah me too bud, but people need to know of them, like them and buy them in order for you to make more games. The actual making of the game is maybe 30% of what it is to be indie.

3. Be polite, kind and responsive to your fans and critiques. Most people are good, and very very few are assholes, but the ones in the second category are extremely loud. Say thank you to those that have shown kindness, say thank you to those that have provided constructive criticism and don't say anything to the trolls, all they want to do is make you angry.

4. Criticism hurts like hell... you won't even realize how hard it can hit you sometimes. When it makes you angry, don't say anything, just walk away for 30 minutes, calm down and with a clear mind come back and read it again. Sometimes it will be right and you'll agree with it even though your initial reaction was ""this guy has no idea what he's saying"".

&gt;Were you unhappy before this project? How do you feel now?

Unhappy... no Can't say I was. Maybe a little unfulfilled and really annoyed at times. I don't like taking orders that don't make sense and when you're working from someone else you have to do that a lot, especially when going up the corporate ladder.

&gt;How do you feel now?

Important... fulfilled... genuinely happy. I'm actually doing what I've always wanted and it's starting to work and catching some momentum. It's one of those cases where the journey is so much more interesting than the destination. I get to talk to other developers and learn from them, I get to talk to big corporations about all sorts of business plans, I set my own schedule. It doesn't feel like a job anymore, it doesn't feel like a hobby either, it sort of transcends both and it feels real. Everything I do has a consequence and it's amazing, I feel like what I do matters! 

Not gonna lie, initially I got into it because I just wanted to make games, but what I found is soo much more rewarding as an individual. Yes it has it's moments of utter depression, when something fails, doesn't go according to plan or you get written off as a nobody, but it's just part of the package. High risk, high rewards, and feels really freaking real!

671,"You'd be surprised but a lot of this stuff falls into place if you think about what you're doing from the get-go. 

The main thing that makes a user frustrated, and consequently a game ""too hard"" is unresponsive controls and a lack of fairness. Controls should of razor sharp precision, the enemies should not be hidden and if they are, there should be some mechanic that allows the player to combat that problem.

I've played a hell of a lot of games in my time and the thing I enjoy the most is the game responding correctly to my actions. I press left, object goes left, i release left object stops going left, or does so in a very predictable pattern that makes logical sense. If I'm driving a car and pull right, I expect the car to pull right in that very second so i can save myself. If something kills the player in a manor in which he could not have avoided through skill alone, that's a game being ""too hard"". 

The second thing with Void 21 is that it's repeatable. You fucked something up? That's fine, just start that section again and try again, the level is exactly the same and you can remember what you did wrong and counter it. 

As long as the user doesn't feel cheated by the game (ruber-banding, hidden obstacles, invisible walls), the rules are set in stone and they get enough chances to fix their mistakes and try again, it will remain enjoyable. 

Super Meat boy is another title that applies this perfectly. It's insanely hard, but pressing the buttons at the correct time will always get you through the level and you instantly jump back and try again if you fail. Failure is a natural process of learning and nobody feels bad for failing if they're not punished for just trying to learn and become better.",2016-04-29 15:20:07+00:00,d2m5eb9,2.0,t1_d2m4y3k,618.0,IAmA

Yup! Hi! We like Reddit a lot and spend most of our time here. It's pretty much the best way to learn about anything random of any kind (news, how to, tutorial, etc), or procrastinate and look at cats... Knowledge is power!

&gt;That maybe because i'm alone and can't do anything about design one bit.

I'll tell you a secret, neither can I. My ""design skills"" came out of necessity. I just picked something simple and ran with it. Trial and error until I got something I liked, aka mimicking vector graphics. If you'd put me to model anything photo-realistic i'd be combing google on ""photo-realistic modeling beginner guide"". There's no such thing as talent, it's just experience and practice, ask any artist and they'll tell you the same.

&gt;Can i just ask is it worth the money and time? 

It's about as worth it as any other business out there really. Similarly it's as difficult as any other business out there I suppose. Currently I'm nowhere near showering in expensive cars and eating gold-infused ice cream. Beat up second-hand car, rented apartment, you know average Joe stuff. It has the potential to grow really big, but don't kid yourself that it's going to happen on its own or over-night, it takes a lot of work.

I got in it more because I love gaming and VR specifically, and wanted to take part in the ""VR Revolution"". I want to succeed to make my ideas and creations come to life, money is just a by-product that comes out of that, a tool and nothing more. To be completely honest with you someone telling me that they like my game is much more rewarding than the income i get from them buying it, but I do need that income to make more games so it's an interesting cycle. 

Basically if someone told me ""we'll take care of your living expenses and you do what you want with your life"" i'd still be doing this because it's what I want to do, so to me it's really worth it. 

&gt;Also which part really pushed you hard? Design? Management? Business?

Marketing... Advertising... I despise the damn thing. I hate having to go and ""Show off"". You're basically trying to get people to look at your game and it's probably the most challenging thing of all. You can choose between going through a publisher that does this for you but you loose a huge chunk of your income, or you self-publish which means you have to do the dirty work of asking people to look at your game. 

I try to find creative ways of doing it however, fun ways so it's not all like ""LOOK AT MY GAME IT'S AWESOME BUY IT NOW!!!!"" like the video you linked above. While it is more effort on our part, it's also more rewarding to you guys to actually see something interesting rather than an Add on google.

&gt;Also TIL there is a job called UX engineer.

Oh it's one hell of a ride. You know all the companies that make banking apps for your phone and such? That's not the bank hiring developers, the bank hires another company that specializes in making these sort of apps. Those companies have entire teams of people hired as UX Designers, UX Engineers that all day analyse and try and find ways for you, the user, to do what you need to get done faster and with fewer clicks. Or they find ideas to make you spend more money.

I've once sat in a 2 hour UX meeting discussing if the facebook button should have a blue background or not. Saying it like that sounds stupid but after doing what's called an [A/B Test](https://vwo.com/ab-testing/) we saw that the facebook button with a blue background had a 22% higher click-rate than the one with a white background. 

Welcome to 2016 where everything is analyzed to the extreme.

673,"We're really not big enough to give a worth-while answer to that. It depends on budget, company size, and internal knowledge and resources. Hiring a different company to do it from a business perspective makes a lot of sense as it delegates most of the responsibility to the contractor. I think the easiest way to go about it is:

Does your game handle micro transactions or anything similar in which you are handling sensitive customer information? If yes, hire a 3rd party and a reputable one at that. Your payment system gets compromised and customer information leaks you could be facing one hell of a law-suit. If not, make your own by either learning how to or hiring an individual that knows how to as it will allow you to adapt to threats and grow your company knowledge.

674,"&gt; how do you combat piracy? 

So hard that we don't really bother that much with it. The compromise of having full DRM is too big for a title of this size, it's too big for any title that's not an MMO really. There are sooo many talented individuals out there that can decompile and re-edit your game to circumvent your protections it's probably better invested to just let them be and focus your energy into just making a better game. There is also a hidden ""secret"" for pirates but I don't want to spoil too much on that. Finally pirated versions can't make use of the upcoming leaderboard feature as the server that hosts the leaderboard does its own validity check that the game submitting the new score is indeed legit by contacting the steam server. You can probably circumvent it by having the game submit the score as a legit steam users that owns the game, but that defeats the purpose as now it's not your score at the top, it's random user X.

&gt;how hard is it to draw pixel by pixel frame by frame the animation of your character? 

That's probably a question better suited for a 2D game than for us. With 3D models, the rendering is pretty much done automatically based on the object's position in space at the time of drawing. The engine handles the actual rendering, we just need to make sure the information is ready for it when it begins to draw. It's really a question of ""how long is a piece of string"" but for our title i'm going to say it's relatively easy.

&gt;which game engine is the best?

Haha trick question. It depends on the job that you're doing.

Unity 3D is like a hammer, you can pretty much do anything with it BUT it won't be well suited for every job. You can hammer in a screw for example, but it's not the best way to go about it

Unreal is more like a very complex army knife in which you can really catch your ears if you don't know what you're doing. It takes a really long time to master, but doing so will grant you mad programmer skillz.

I unfortunately don't have experience in any other engines, but all of them have their plus and minuses, it really depends on what you want to make and what you already know before starting out.",2016-04-29 12:44:31+00:00,d2lzkfd,2.0,t1_d2lz7dq,768.0,IAmA
675,"I'm not 100% sure what you're asking but I undrestood that as:

""Have you taken any inspiration from past success / failure stories when doing this crazy stunt?"". If that's the case the answer is yes, most notably two stories.

1. Flippfly's Race the Sun saw an extremely slow start because they couldn't initially get on the Steam store as the Greenlight process was a lot harsher back when they released. Over a few months they managed to get the attention necessary to become a huge success but it was a really difficult road for them. Initially I though we could do better, but now I am a lot more humble. [You can read about their launch here](http://flippfly.com/race-the-sun-a-month-after-launch-losing-steam/)

2. As for failure the most notable is [this article from gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielWest/20150908/253040/Good_isnt_good_enough__releasing_an_indie_game_in_2015.php). Here you can read about a platformer that by all means was a pretty solid game, and got coverage even from total biscuit himself but didn't get any traction. That article is not enough to explain their failure but it's a good story to dig in and analyze. My personal opinion is they failed because they tried to launch a platformer in an over-saturated platofrmer market without bringing anything truly unique to the table. Yes it's a solid platofmer but it's not revolutionary in any way and when you're going up against super meat boy... A side theory I have is that the art-style didn't match the level of difficulty. The game itself is insanely hard but has really cutesy graphics that don't reflect that at all. ",2016-04-29 12:35:07+00:00,d2lzatq,2.0,t1_d2lz1ds,566.0,IAmA
676,"What went right:

- Development is not as hard as you'd expect, nor is it as much of a hassle as it used to be. Technically-wise there is an insane amount of information out there on how to create a quality title, with a lot of devs sharing their story from the technical side.
- Photo-realism as a requirement is a myth. You can impress in so many different ways using even old school graphics as every 8-bit platform developer can tell you. However we went down the route of vector graphics and people really seem to enjoy the art style
- Don't be affraid to ask for stuff. You want to make a PSVR title, tweet Sony and ask them, it's really that simple. However if you do choose to do so and they reply to you, be ready to show them something high quality to back up your claims. These companies won't through opportunity at you just for asking.
- Engage your audience. So many companies don't do this and it's costing them a lot. Be kind to your supporters, learn to say thank you in public. They'll appreciate you more if you treat them like humans and not money bags. Also be kind to your critiques! A lot of them are just wanting to help, and for the ones that are just trolling you? Remember this ""DON'T FEED THE TROLL"". Nobody will judge you for not replying to a comment along the lines of: ""Your game sucks, go get a job"". It's not constructive, it's not useful to you or anyone else, just ignore it. 

What went wrong:

- Our launch, jesus christ were we misinformed. So in my team there are two people and none of us have the vaguest idea on how to market and promote. We went in thinking ""it's fine, we have a quality product and people will like it and promote it for us""... ha ha ha... ha.... no. Prepare yourself as making a game is maybe 30% of the battle, after you've actually developed it the really hard part begins, showing it to people. 
Due to the high amount of games coming out and a lot of them with publisher backing, even indies, you will have to shout as loud as you can to get noticed. Which leads me into my next point
- Start promoting early. Literally when you have your first screenshot of it working and looking good-ish, make twitter/facebook pages and start showing off to people, the more they like you and your game early on, the more they'll be willing to help. We did not do this and we're struggling to get noticed.

Where we're improving:

- So while the launch was pretty much a disaster it's not the end of the world. Steam has some tools for re-marketing your game once its launched that are free, but you better darn well don't do the same mistake again. Now that we have a slight following we can hopefully gain enough attention to boost up the exposure on steam.

- Get a booth at gaming events. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. Not only do people get to try out your game but you can talk to a lot of people in the industry and gain ideas and information on what to do next to better your game in all aspects. Literally just Mingle and be kind an polite. 

Also, thanks for asking, we really appreciate it!

685,"The game currently works by saving all progress to the registry in a specific format. I'm currently working on a better way to do saving progress that would also be compatible with steam save cloud but it's a work in progress. However, the way the current save is structured if you indeed corrupt any part of it should just affect that one part, not the whole save. For example if interrupted while it was saving the stats on your current run, it should only affect the stat save for that run and, for example, what unlocks you gained. 

Saving also takes very little time, less than half a second usually, so having an indicator flash for would either go unnoticeable or would be a placebo, which I'm now kind of considering as people would know not to alt+f4 a specific points of the game.

In your particular case, I suspect the game was either unable to write to the registry from the begging, or has become unable to do so in recent times. Let's start by exploring that option, if you like:

1. Open Regedit
2. Navigate to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Taranasus Studio\Void 21
3. Does this registry folder exist? If yes continue
4. Right click the Void 21 folder and choose Export
5. Save the file somewhere on your hard drive you can find
6. Attach the file to an email and send it over to taranasusstudio@gmail.com, with the subject ""Reddit: LatherSoul1987 save issue - Original Save"".

After doing that, start the game up again:

7. Are you still at 0XP?
8. Complete a run, anything you choose, could be even a training level, but fully complete it up to the point where it's showing your stat screen at the end of the run
9. Close the game and do not start it up again until you have finished step 12. 
10. Do steps 1-6 again with the email subject ""Reddit: LatherSoul1987 save issue - Test Save with Log"" but don't send it yet.
11. Navigate to where you installed the game in steam, should be something like ""steamapps\common\Void 21"" and then go into the Void21_Data folder. 
12. Grab the output_log.txt and attach it to the email. 
13. Send the email.

This should allow me to have a look at your save files and see what happened between them, if progressed is saved and the log should tell me if any problems were encountered while saving.

As a gamer, that's really what I'm fearing the most. Yeah they can't drop support for EXE due to all the enterprise applications that use them but they can just say something like

*Due to the high complexity of some of the features offered by DX13, we can only support it with UWP applications*

However if Vulkan pulls through and is just as good as what MS can pull out of their R&amp;D team, it would kick them right in the teeth, as developers as a general rule don't like being dependent of a closed software ecosystem. It limits their potential to market by a huge margin. 

On top of that I'm also thinking that the next-gen consoles like PS5 or wahtever will come out will be dependent on Vulkan / OpenGL since DX is a microsoft technology, and the big game publishers and developers as they want to cover the maximum ammount of market will rather drop DX support in favor of Vulkan in order to sell on PS + Linux + Windows + Mac rather than Xbox + UWP.

It's like that due to my lack of experience. I wrote those about 2 months ago when I didn't realize I can do OS detection and choose which type of hardware accelerator based on that info. 

With the next major update (1.1) when i'm releasing Mac / Linux ports and the Leaderboard feature I will change the requirements to DX11 for windows, Open GL for Linux and Mac. 

Why not Open GL on Windows? Simplicity really. If something breaks on windows due to DX11 I have someone to shout at + a lot more resources to consult myself with + I don't know how Open GL and Oculus work together, and it's not something I don't want to experiment with at the moment. With Linux and Mac I don't have a choice until Vulkan comes around in Unity. Once that hits, and if it doesn't cause any problems with the VR support, everything is getting switched to Vulkan as I WANT that to succeed.

775,"Sure!

So the DB is the leaderboard. Game sends data to it in order to have leaders and people can get all competitive if they want.

Now I'm inexperienced but I'm no dumbass. I didn't make the game communicate with the DB directly. The game communicates with a website and that communicates with the DB so the connection string is not in the game itself.

Now I also made the game send the data to the website encrypted + salt. But because Unity .net code is about as secure as locking your door with a big rock, all it takes is a little decompiler to get tot he encryption algorithm and just stick it in a different application. 

So now they're probably sending the data like that to my webpage trying to inject information into the DB. Joke's on them though because in the website backend I have further validations in place to make sure the data that's sent is authentic as well as sanitized. I am not going to go into detail about exactly what I'm doing as it's still not perfect, but it will keep them busy for a while until I get my grand master validation plan in place &gt;:)

The crash log, once i got it to spit out everything, was pointing back to an issue with mono libraries which I don't want to start messing around with (my experience is not that great).

796,"UUUU tricky question. So I've tried both, OR CV1 from a friend, PSVR at EGX Rezzed.

Oculus: If they can fix the lingering problems with the colour smearing and get the touch out, it would be an awesome platform, but there are a few things putting it down right now:

- Colour Smearing: It's an issue, it can happen, and it's quite unacceptable
- Lack of hand controls: It's coming, but without them I question the worth of the headset at $600. How much are the controllers going to be an extra 200-300? 
- The camera tracking technology is a little bit of a drawback, mainly for the fact of what if I have two of the damn things in the same room? Granted PSVR suffers from this as well (I think. can't say for sure) but for example with the Vive you don't have this problem
- They have some sketchy practices that make me have my reservations towards the device: no refunds, data being sent to facebook constantly (allegedly)... owned by facebook - but this is more personal opinions.

PSVR: Defo has SOME downsides, but the price point makes up for it like 10-fold. 

- Screen resolution is that of a DK2 which is not bad, but not as good as the competitors. You won't notice it once you get into the game but if you look for it.... it's there
- Head and controller tracking didn't feel as responsive as the competitors. Again it's good but it's no Vive good. 

That's about it for negatives, now positives of the PSVR even over oculus:

- The headset is supper comfortable, both are really. I enjoyed the PSVR more though because of the rigidity of the plastics holding it together. I love not having to fiddle around with Velcro straps.
- There is a mechanical switch that adjusts the headset lense-eye distance which i find amazing. It's really precise and easy to use
- It already has hand tracking batoon technology (PS Move)
- It's plug and freaking play. Appart from the potential download of a software update, you plug in the cables and GO!

Hope that helps.

813,"Thanks for the kind words. We were attending EGX last week and the ques were insane. Managed to get a quick demo as a dev and I have to say, for the price-point, the device is amazing! 

Resolution isn't great... that's literally the only negative thing I can say about it. It's DK2 quality and by no means is that a bad thing, just slightly bellow more expensive competitors. 

On the other hand:

- The lenses are top notch. Did not see any distortion or chromatic aberration. Was well impressed by that

- It's comfortable, really comfortable. You can adjust the distance of the lenses from the eyes easily with a mechanical switch (none of this adjustable Velcro silliness)
- Super easy to set up, plug'n'play. There may be a software update that needs to be done on the PS4 on launch day but that's no more hassle than installing a game really.
- Field of view was solid
- Framerate was amazing, that 120fps, for the games that run it, really makes a hell of a differance
- Tracking was pretty spot on, not perfect like the Vive, but it's quite a bit above oculus DK2 tracking. 
- once you get into the game, immersion happens really quickly. I didn't really felt presence yet but I only demoed it for like 10 minutes in each game.

I think, because of its quite resonable price point, it will work quite well. May take a while to get off the ground initially but Sony have a winner on their hands.

822,"As an Elite Dangerous fan, Alpha backer and overall space nut with over 400 hours in E:D, A LOT has gone wrong with this game, but here is a list of my top picks about what happened:

- The missions are dull as bricks. Back when the whole thing started with kickstarter and Alpha we were promised very long and extensive chained missions for the player to explore and create their own stories with. What we got were some very basic fetch/kill quests that got boring after going through them once or twice.

- The trading feels meaningless. Since you don't affect the economy in any way you wouldn't really do it apart from the grind.

- The stories, while interesting, don't really affect the universe in any real way. You don't see any massive shift in law / trade / npc behavior etc based on who's in power, who got killed etc. Yeah a war or two may start in a solar system but that's about it. 

- There is no reason to get invested in the world. Nothing you do affects it, or even creates the illusion of affecting it. I know that Frontier wanted to emphasize that you are not a hero, you're just another joe going about, but even a joe has the power to kill the president in the real world and change the faith of history. In Elite there is no such option, you're just there.

- The dev team doesn't seem to have a direction either than making money. I gladly gave them my money, a hell of a lot of it, yet I've yet to see much in return for it. I can go look at pretty planets in an empty universe, land on an empty planet to do empty tasks that have no baring on the future of that planet, my future, the future of the universe or anything.

841,"&gt;Is there any ETA on it though?

Sadly no :(

&gt;Hope you raise the money soon.

Trust me bud, so do we 

&gt;Has the game been selling well?

EEEHHHH that's a tricky question. Well by ""nobody has ever heard of me before"" standards? Yes! Well by ""I need to live for the next year off of this""... not yet.

Honestly I wouldn't know what to tell you with regards to how well it's going to do. This is our first tango and we're learning as well. Tomorrow we're going to build our stand at EGX Rezzed in London for the 3 day exhibition so that will hopefully gain some attention. It's really all about exposure. Everyone seems to love the game but unfortunately being good is not good enough, you need to get your megaphone out and yell in people's ears which takes a lot longer than just launching unfortunately.

&gt;I mean how many copies would you need to sell to raise the money and how far have you gotten so far.

So far we've sold about 100 which is cool, but to get a server we need to sell at least 10,000. The hosting cost alone makes me dizzy thinking about it. 

Thanks for being so excited and liking the game so much, it means the world to me. It means a lot to my partner as well but she doesn't like talking that much :P

Leaderboards are coming in the future. Currently all of your player data is being stored locally on your PC in your save file and once we can raise enough money to be able to afford a server to host them you will get them!

It's funny because I actually wanted to have them on release, we just currently can't afford the hosting back-end that will show all of your data as compared to other users.

It's such a simple thing too... I hate it when the door presses me into hard decisions :(

Linux is an amazing platform that suffers one HUGE problem. It's made by hackers for hackers. Actual code hackers not crackers i'm talking here. They will spend the time to make the most amazing features but they have no grasp on the needs of the average joe that barely knows how to use a mouse. 

Linux folk tend to not understand why users don't use linux. Because it's difficult when it doesn't work the way you expect it. Example: To install video drivers on the mac you do... fuck all. The OS X takes care of that for you. To install video drivers on windows you go to the manufacturer website, click the driver you need, click next next next, Boom your done!

To install video drivers in linux however? How long johnson. What distro do you have? does it use apt-get or something eles? Do you want the closed-source manufacturer driver or the community made one? Do i need to compile it? I don't know... i just want to play games! 

If some company would invest the time to remove the... linux out of linux and make it a consumer friendly OS, it would be amazing for gaming. Between its super efficient resource management and Vulkan it can be a super winner... 

But it needs to be user friendly first... and I mean user i-don't-know-how-to-mouse friendly. ",2016-04-04 23:06:52+00:00,d1pz4eu,4.0,t1_d1pyhll,952.0,outrun

- NOBODY should have to buy something without being able to try it first
- NOBODY should be denied refunds if it is within a reasonable time-frame. Some of these games can cause serious discomfort and as such a customer should not be stuck with an unusable product.

1034,"&gt;Right, but as I said above, why is it that it's just the women with the ""sexy"" trait?

Uhm... While I can't speak 100% on behalf of women, men portrayed in games as muscular, perfectly-body beings is quite the sexualisation and objectification of them, it's not only a power-fantasy kind of thing but also the showing off of a physical form that is next to impossible to obtain. While I don't specifically play games to indulge myself in male sexiness because i'm attracted to females, my girlfriend has mentioned time and time again how all the male characters in most AAA titles are very visually pleasing and designed to be attractive to females. Then if we go one step further and look at a game like Yandere Simulator, this is pretty much a game in which males are transformed into prizes. Yes the game is deeply disturbing but it doesn't make it any less true. 

If we go outside the realm of gaming we can look at an anime called Kill la Kill where both men and women are equally objectified and turned into sexual objects by displaying them as close to naked as possible, with naked sexy men often being portrayed in the episodes for no other reason than fan service.

&gt;Yes, men can be half naked in games and they can flex their muscles, but mainly it's to emphasize power or aggression (which makes sense in games about killing people)

Is it though? Is that the point of shirtless teenagers in twilight. But yes we are talking about games not movies and the truth is there are far less games specifically targeted at women than there are men. This is an undeniable truth which will hopefully be fixed in the future by more individuals that do understand female taste and thus create games targeted towards that audience. But should this future come, would the men in those videogames not be made in such a way to appeal to women on a sexual level? There's enough evidence to show that this would be the case if we extrapolate from other forms of media so it's not really a problem of ""why are women so sexualized in games"", as it is  a problem of ""why are there not more games targeted at women?"". I've seen plenty of girls playing videogames so there's definitely a market for them but why are none being made?

&gt; I don't really think men are objectified sexually in games, though I'm open to be proven wrong.

Please make abstraction of the satirical nature of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OquEkn7Ih98) it's a bit in poor taste, but all of the snippets shown here do nothing to appeal to the power-fantasies of the men which play them.

P.S. When given the option, I play a female character in video games rather than a male one because I am much more attracted to a powerful sexy female hero than a muscular sexy bloke that just grunts all the time. The female form is just much more pleasant and enjoyable in her gracefulness than HULK SMASH, HULK BASH.

1035,"Hello! 

I've personally changed my opinion as this issue developed so I can't speak for everyone else. 

So as new evidence has come to light it appears that it was blizzard's intent as well to remove the pose which is fine. Tracer doesn't HAVE to be sexy but my stance on the matter was ""why can't she be sexy as well"" if that's what the creators want in the end.

The whole thing escalated out of proportion due to bad timing. If this happened 6 months ago probably nobody would care but because of the crazynes that's been happening with feminism trying to censor videogames for female characters only it sent out the wrong kind of message and snowballed out of control. 

The whole issue wasn't about tracer or how sexy her character is portrayed really, it just rubbed people like me the wrong way since in recent times all to often we here how ""OMG GAMERS ARE SUCH PERVERTS THEY NEED TO BE REEDUCATED, REMOVE ALL THE SEXYNESS FROM VIDEOGAMES- but only for females tho, objectification of men is fine"".

1044,"&gt;what kind of work load is required to ""recompile"" a game on a totally different api?

It depends a hell of a lot on the game engine. If you're using Unity and the unity guys do a good job when implementing the feature, chances are its just a checkbox and then fixing minor bugs.

However that is a very nice and best case scenario. If you're using your own custom engine... I honestly don't know, but I'm going to go with SIGNIFICANT. Probably somewhere between months and impractically long.

&gt;I would love to move to linux as my daily driver, but it just isn't going to do everything that windows currently does for me (especially as a gamer) and dual booting seems like a massive hassle.

Yep, although I wouldn't call it a hassle. It's more of a... If i need to do something that is not gaming related while I am gaming, i'd have to log off, restart, boot up linux, open app, do thing, restart, back in game... or just alt tab, do thing, back in game. Yeah no...

&gt; Honestly, I just don't see any true linux competitor to windows within the next 5 or even 10 years.

1053,"Okay, your confused and that's fine. Let's walk through what I know and hopefully that will be enough to get you started.

How to be a game dev by Taranasus:

1. This is not easy. It's not a quick job, it's not an easy job, it's a really fun and rewarding job but you will never fully master it. You can get good at it but no man is an island. If you think you'll spend only a week on your first game think again. While it may take a week to make a game like flappy bird, it takes months to learn the skills necesary. This is by no means intended to scare you or out you off, it's setting expectations and the harsh reality is that becoming a game dev is a slow and at times frustrating process. If you accept that from the beginning you'll do much better going forward.

2. Prepare to learn a lot! This is not a one trick pony job like backend web dev or sys admin. As you gain more experience you will quickly discover that you need to know a bit of 3D modelling, sound engineering, image editing, texture mapping, hardware specifications and limitations, video editing and if you decide to go indie, PR, marketing and accounting. It's a lot to take in, but don't worry it's not impossible. While it seems overwhelming at first you don't realy sit down to learn these things, you discover them bit by bit as you gain experience but it is quit the information overload

3. Now onto the technical. You chose android as a platform already which can be a fun starting point. The popular choice for starting game devs for any platform is the Unity3D game engine. It's relatively easy to use, quite powerful, free to learn and distribute free games and so many people use it that If you run into a problem, 99% chance that there's and answer somewhere on the Internet. 

Unity is also good because at the click of a button, you can make your game for PC, phone, console, whatever you fancy. The languages you can use in it are JavaScript (not very great) or C# (fucking amazing). 

So now if you want to go with unity your next step should be to subscribe to /r/gamedev and /r/Unity3d. A few days ago on one of these two subreddits someone posted a link to a unity3d course that is free now and used to be worth 250$. Price doesn't necessarily equal quality but it might be good to check out.

1060,"&gt; Did you even read the post in question? It was a very reasonable explanation for why they felt the pose didn't fit the character,

I read it, and while I understand their reasoning behind the request I don't agree with it as I don't understand why the character known as tracer can't be sexy as well as funny, friendly and agile... But my personal beliefs is besides the point.

&gt;and you call them a dumb attention seeking asshole? 

Nope, I'm not calling that person this at all. I'm calling neo-feminists that. People that believe men should be subjected to guilty until proven innocent treatment if accused of rape. People who believe that men shouldn't have the right to talk back to women or criticized their work just because of their gender while at the same time claiming to support equal rights. It is those people that I call dumb attention seeking assholes.

&gt;The dev said that they hadn't been happy with the pose and had been considering replacing it themselves

Cool if that's what they wanted, but the fact that they choose to do so when only one person complained, while there are other bigger complaints backed by multiple individuals that go ignored makes this a very odd and questionable decision. 

&gt;So now people who are outraged over what they perceive to be a developer changing something due to internet pressure are trying to get the developers to change something by using the internet to put pressure on them.

1091,"Hehehe don't loose faith it's all good.

If you want to get a little more philosophical about it: it's an interesting phenomenon that happens to all ""lables""... i'm going to go with labels, that have been oppressed in the past and are no longer.

The recepie seems to be: a specific categorization of humans were oppressed (women, blacks, indians, eastern europeans (because communism)) and at some point, through a lot of hardship and effort they gain equal or close to equal rights. At least in the eyes of the law they get equal rights, racism, sexism, xenofobism on an individual level is a problem of education, not leadership or freedom.

Once they obtain these equal rights, at some point a very small subsection of this group decides to start demanding for more ""rights"", and will use tools that have worked in the past to try and promote these ideals to both gain support and privilage. For example in eastern countries it is not uncommon for people to blame their governments for not taking care of them like the communist regime wold, even though these are the same people that demanded the freedom from the regime. They consider that because the communist government brought them up this way, they should receive special benefits from the current one since they ""can't adapt to the new way"". But when I say people, it's just a small but vocal minority.

Same with neo-feminism or apparently FemiNatzi. Some assholes went like ""Hey look, we got what we wanted... Let's see how far we can push it :D"" and welcome to today. 

As for your argument with that person you mentioned earlier:

&gt;The other person said that he/she doesnt believe that men are buffed in movies etc. because women think thats sexy, but rather because men have power fantasies.

So why doesn't this logic work in reverse? Are chicks in movies not made to look that way in order to be power fantasies for other women? Even tracer in this very game, is she not a strong independent role model for women? Hell I want to be a little bit more like her and I'm a bloke...

And if these same people tell me that a woman will willingly shove plastic in her breasts and ass, have fat surgically removed, alter their bone structure and cartilages only so that they will appeal more to men, I'm sorry but they are full of shit. Also they are full of shit if they tell me that the whole cosmetic and fashion industry was specifically designed or created only so that women can learn how to appeal to men... who most days don't give a rat's ass about it anyway.

No... I'm sorry they're all full of shit...

1145,"Olla! Wanted to shed light on why this is done.

Option A: The engine is shit and doesn't have a separate physics loop to the drawing loop. ELI5: The game draws a new image every frame, and does the calculations for what has changed in the world in the time between the two frames without taking into account how much physical time has passed. 

Option B: The engine does have a separate physics loop but the developers didn't use it properly. ELI5: There is a code that runs in between each frame to do drawing and rendering, but then there is a completely separate code that is run every x ms (say every 10ms for 100fps) and does all the physics calculations. Problems arise when developers still implement physics mathematical calculations in the draw loop instead of using the physics loop, most probably due to lack of experience. 

""But /u/taranasus why would such a big company make such rookie mistakes?""

Because you're referring to them wrong, they are not a games company they are a games factory. Blizzard is a games company, Ubisoft is a games factory (for example). They hire fresh undergrads with no experience because they are cheap as dirt, force them to work stupid hours because they have no choice and haven't developed a backbone to tell the manager to shove it, and put out a new crappy iteration every year of the same shovelware AAA title. 

Don't get me wrong, it's in no way the undergrad's fault. He's young, overworked and underpaid, how can you expect him to produce top notch quality work. So the easy solution? Limit fps to 60 and then no more physics problem. ",2016-03-28 07:07:03+00:00,d1g4009,5.0,t1_d1g2trp,3928.0,pcgaming

As for finding artists, here's one way to approach it: If you don't have anyone in mind and don't mind working over the internet, post on facebook in the ""Indie Game Developers"" group and requesting for one (can't link due to subreddit rules). However as you can imagine, nothing in this world is free so they will most probably cost money. Most are willing to negotiate however so see if you strike a deal with someone.

She does most of the business side, handles ""official"" communications and some of the finance. Music we contracted someone to do and that's about all I can think of right now. Actual artwork it's basically a who can get to it first and we have on person willing to make us a nice big poster for the EGX event. QA and testing is handled by the misses with support from some of our friends that have offered to beta test whenever they have time. Talk about a Mickey Mouse operation :D

5) @taranasusstudio for business, @taranasus to see me be generally stupid :D

6) Well apart from the the shouting I can do for myself not really. My last plan of attack right now is email youtubers with steam keys and hoping for the best. First batch of emails sent out to the big guns (totalbiscuit, nerd3, jack septic eye) and the like seems to have only gotten me one key activation (out of 85 sent). I have another batch going out on Tuesday to medium to small youtubers in the hopes that it will generate better results. But AFAIK it's not usually a very fruitful practice. No pain in trying though. Following release on the 4th, we're attending EGX Rezzed in London on the 7th to let people play the game at a stand and throw some pins at their faces. Also hopefully some press coverage, that would be nice :D

The trick with PR and Marketing is this: Expect nothing, and be surprised when something actually goes your way. It is one hell of a soul-crushing experience.

1195,"No problem, and you're right, upvotes was the wrong measurement. I should have pointed out the actual balance of positive vs negative feedback within the comments section as that is a better ratio indicator of like versus dislike.

Here's the thing, I don't expect everyone to like it. I didn't really expect these many people to like it to be honest with you. I'm aware that the title has some problems at the core, it'd be impossible not to since even AAA games have problems, what's to say my tiny first attempt will be perfect.

I went on to address all of your point as best I could, some I can fix, some I can't because it's too late and I don't have the means and that's just the reality of it. 

What i disliked about your post (and maybe you didn't intend of it, but it just came out that way) was your ultimate negativity at the game's popularity in, ironically, a thread that is indicating the opposite. 

&gt;Not something I, nor I imaging most people, would actually pay for.

You've clearly indicated your dislike for the title, and that's fine I respect that, but what gives you the authority to reply on behalf of everyone else? Regardless if you personally approve of it or not you're basically dismissing quite a few months of my life which have been dedicated to working on this based solely on your opinion, and then further claiming that this opinion is probably shared by the majority of people when this whole thread reflects otherwise. 

&gt;I wish you all the best personally and hope that even if the game fails financially you'll be able to get back on your feet.

Even your ""wish"" is condescending. You've hinted that the game is aimed at failure more than it is towards success and hope that I just get by enough to continue living okay.

1198,"&gt;The epilepsy warning is an image, right? Rendered text would look better. Super blurry on my screen. (Same with the display of the XB360 controls in the pause menu?)

You'll want to increase the texture quality in options but you have a point.

&gt;Performance. Can't hit 60FPS@1440p with a 4670k+R9 290... Usually about 50.... weird plays fine on my 144Hz@1080p 

No clue on this, I've never had any sort of performance problems, especially relating to which display I pick.

&gt;Changing the camera... Using an XBOX 360 controller it works fine while the game is running. If the game is paused though, changing the camera will cause the camera change to occur like a hundred times a second.

Thank you for that, something for me to fix :)

&gt;Game doesn't start on my main display. Opted for a secondary display. weird.

It is unfortunately a unity bug. I'm hoping they'll fix it soon. It's the main reason I have a display picker in the menu to begin with.

&gt;From a gameplay perspective the slow horizontal movement is terrible. I feel like, dependant on where things spawn, there are some obstacles that no matter how quickly I react, are impossible to avoid. Like walls or windmills. It takes 7 seconds to get from one side of the highway to the other. Game would be better if it weren't so slow.

Final game has swappable modules, there are modules that allow you to steer faster but ultimately, the game levels are procedural, they are always the same thus giving the possibility to memorize and proactively calculate your trajectory rather than react.  

&gt;The procedurally generated levels are just.... Not good at all. It really is random. Absolutely no design nor intent to create interesting levels. Games like Spelunky for example create patterns and string the patterns together to create interesting levels.

Point taken. I neither have the team size, time, money or experience to achieve this at this point, so it's more of a I need to become bigger before I can actually undertake something more complex and well planned out with predetermined patterns. 

&gt;I've used Unity before and your game is basically like one of those, ""Learn To Make Your First Game!"" beginner tutorials. Not something I, nor I imaging most people, would actually pay for.

I can only assume that everyone who's up voted this post is crazy then or has money to burn. I understand your opinion on it and that's fine it's perfectly legit, but how can you project it on everyone else especially in this post?

&gt; I wish you all the best personally and hope that even if the game fails financially you'll be able to get back on your feet.

1199,"&gt;How long have you been a game developer?

26th of November 2015.

&gt;Also what's it been like for you creating the game? 

I had a hell of a lot of fun with it. I got to work on what I always wanted to do, I didn't have a schedule enforced on me by work, I didn't have to ask anyone to take a sick day. I think the trick is to work on a project you want to work on and not something you're forced to work on. 

&gt;Finally, how much is the expected price?

1201,"Part 1: After developer X resigned and I resigned as well, they had to hire two Solutions Architects instead of us (as we were doing quite insane specialized work) that cost 3 times more than both of us put together. Enterprises these days see people as they see a computer, it's just a replaceable machine that can do the same task as any other machine, it just does it better or worse depending on the pick and it costs this much money to operate. It's all a maths game to reach a specific quote or target, they don't care about excellence they just care about that target.

This is the main reason why right now the most anticipated game of the year is NMS, an indie title made by 10 modest but very skilled individuals. It's also why Witcher 3 was game of the year last year. A title (granted not technically indie) was game of the year due to the insane quality that a polish studio put out. And all of this is because each individual working on the game is talented and experienced, not some undergrad fresh out of uni with nothing backing them

Also it's why every blizzard game is such a hit. They stick to their guns, they play on their skills and they don't cycle through employees like they are throw-away printers. 

Part 2: Glad it made such a good  impression. It probably will use a little more power than Super Hexagon tho due to the fact that it's a bit more CPU intensive. Enemy trajectory, high enemy count, high bullet count all of that adds up to CPU load sadly.

I say it's a good first game / starting project. It's something that a noob can do to better themselves while still putting out a quality product.

It's something that can be done comfortably in one person given enough time and money. 

If you're working on your very first game, don't aim too high, because you'll get bored and annoyed by your own lack of competency and will give up on it.

If it's because you don't like Steam, then I suggest waiting. I said 100,000 copies on a whim, they didn't set out strict targets for what I need to get on GoG but the game has to present enough benefit and quality so that it's on par with everything else they sell (like SuperHot, or Race the sun for example).

The way you achieve this is you make textures that are mainly black, with the detailing white and then you can change the white portions to whatever you want, but it's still going to be a bright colour on top of a lot of black.

What it needs is for all the textures and images to be re-done in a way that doesn't affect the eyes, create alternate materials (game objects basically that wrap the 3d model) for all of the elements, and then implement an option to switch between the two. The hardest part is re-creating the art in a way that won't bother the eyes as much, I need to hire someone to help me and I have someone in mind, but I need to pay them as I do not accept charity work.

&gt; Music is shit. Complete garbage. It's like a 10 seconds infinite loop of chiptunes like in shitty nes games. 

Sounds like you have the music change button constantly pressed or something. Each song is almost 4 minutes long. Make sure you don't have some joystick or controller bound to the change song button that's constantly pressing it down. I've seen this happen before with broken 360 controllers

&gt; Tech execution is not tip top. For some reason it defaulted to my secondary 4:3 screen and I couldn't change it so, I had use windowed mode and then force fullscreen, using borderless gaming app. I later messed with settings and managed to get it to work properly, but it's not ideal. Also I swear my PC does a sqeaking noise when I launch it. Like the actual tower. Literally no other game had these issues on my pc.

For some reason, for some people, it does that. It's the fault of unity or the windows setup and sadly there is not much I can do to fix it, I've tried. It's definitely not consistent behavior for everyone so that's why the options to actually pick your screen are in there. 

&gt; Also I swear my PC does a sqeaking noise when I launch it. Like the actual tower. Literally no other game had these issues on my pc.

No idea what to say to this. Never had this complaint before but i doubt a windows game can cause your physical pc to squeak. Then again, I've been wrong before 

&gt;Game feel... What game feel? 

I honestly can't defend this point. Some people like it, you don't like how it feels, it really boils down to personal preference. I agree I don't have the barrel roll animation or the scraping animation because i focused more on it being precise mechanically and the controls been twitch perfect. The logic for how the guns and missiles behave, how the enemies behave, the fact that the levels are procedurally generated and you can reply those levels in their exact form as many times as you want through the seed picker (Granted not available in the Demo)

&gt; Also you are literally racing the sun, just how cool of premise is that? I get that I am demanding perfection, but that's what it takes to get game feel right and THAT can make or break the game.

This makes me thing that you just enjoy the premise / the idea more than the actual game mechanically, which is fair enough don't get me wrong, but I can't make you race the sun, that's race the sun. I went with a neon, vertex-looking world because that's what I wanted from it and I also wanted to go back a little to the arcade roots of games when they didn't have a story or a complex premise because I miss those days and as a first time developer I didn't want to overshoot and come up with nothing.

I did, and I am, hence why I asked him to elaborate.

&gt; I didn't even say anything negative about it

I never said you did, I expressed my dislike for judgement passed on non-representative media material that doesn't portray an accurate image of the final product, which lead to raising points that are invalid because they are actually addressed in the game.

&gt; I wouldn't have said anything at all if you hadn't specifically asked for it.

I didn't ask you specifically, I asked c3534l specifically, but you replied as well on his behalf. He then later replied himself and what he said made a lot of sense. 

&gt; I'm not going to spend time researching your game through your post history.

I didn't ask you to unless you decide to provide feedback, which you did out of your own free will. And I didn't ask you to research my post history specifically, I gave you two easier methods that require just typing a word and a number.

&gt;If you feel like the video doesn't reflect the gameplay then just say so.

It's much easier to list out what a material is than what it isn't. If I were to list out all the things it isn't to cover everyone's assumptions i'd still be writing. I specified it is a video showcasing how the game changed while in development, and since I didn't mention anything else it just makes logical sense that is doesn't represent anything else. This includes the fact that it's not an accurate representation of gameplay.

&gt; It's silly to get defensive about feedback like that.

Is it? I rely on feedback to attempt to better myself and my game. If I get misinformed feedback and I'm not 100% sure in where I stand it can lead me on a wild goose chase. However if a person bothers to actually tell me their opinion I will do my best to listen and even reply to them because it's polite, civilized and humane. If I just ignore them and disregard them because I disagree right off the bat then what's the point in asking for it? I rather get a little offended and then have an argument, but gain information from it than be a stuck-up prick that just ignores people who he disagrees with.

1505,"Hi /u/quimbies_in_camo_PJs

The reason I gave such a bare-bones response to that point is because I was a little bit annoyed that gamedevs actually decided to judge a full title just based on 20 second sections of video that were not intended in any way to show off the game’s capabilities. I was expecting especially from the users of this community to know not to judge a title by just short clips of gameplay footage so you can see how this caused me to be a little bit cold in my response, but since you asked so nicely, politely and genuinely willing to understand my reasoning here it is (Prepare for wall of text):

The game, if it was just purely a go-fast collectible, would be classified fully in the runner genre which already has some really good titles in it: Race the Sun, Breakneck, Distance, Audiosurf and that’s just off the top of my head, I’m sure there are others. These are all great titles that represent runners well and I do not believe that at this time I would have had the skill and knowledge to make a game to outshine them, thus I wanted to take the idea into a more experimental direction and make a combination of runner and shoot-em-up since that doesn’t look like it’s ever been done before. Original concepts like these is what usually makes or breaks a good indie title, so I wanted to stand out a little bit from the crowd. I basically went with the “Now kiss!” approach and for the most part, it seems to have turned out really well. 

If you look at the [official trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-CZufC1Rcc), you can already see that you can choose to play the game as purely a speed runner, or purely a shoot-em-up, or even a combination of the two by selecting which modules you would like to equip your ship with, thus changing your experience. 

Doing a little research on google, youtube, or even my posting history you can find [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC03_CBZiN6U_n99PRuBO5Dg), [gameplay from the community](https://www.youtube.com/results?sp=CAI%253D&amp;q=%22void+21%22) and [even a demo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550) of the full game on steam to download and try it out. In there you would be clearly able to see that the lanes vary in length, the obstacles vary in size and there is quite a selection of modules to outfit your ship that change your gameplay style drastically. Hell there's even an early review of it on [In2GPU](http://in2gpu.com/2016/03/23/void-21-review/)

All this information is out there and available, but because it was completely ignored and the first reaction that came to mind was to criticize points that have already been addressed, on a video and post not intended to market the game, I just didn’t have the energy and will-power to give a proper lengthy response. It is partially my fault as I didn’t expect people to react this way, and in the future I’m going to be more careful when making a video to make sure it also markets accurately, but yeah there you go.

Why did it look better before in your opinion, what did you like more then and dislike now?

Edit: It wouldn't be nice to ignore my critiques would it? 

Thus I will attempt to address all the points that you've all raised as best i can:

&gt;The wider track

The track is variable in width based on the seed generation system and you can set the width to your preference through the seed picker if you choose to do so

&gt;there's fewer colours

That's pretty much a thing of taste I believe, since I've had a lot more people tell me it looks better this way and I personally prefer it this way as well. Unfortunately there's no one size fits all artistic style because if there was, life would be dull as shit.

&gt; the grid on the ground makes it feel faster as you turn and it's easier to tell where the blocks are going to go which means you could increase the speed without making it more difficult

This was removed as some point as I was trying to make it a Gear VR title initially. But Android doesn't do anisotropic very well so those little lines looked horrible. I might add the back in tho now since I'm not targeting the Gear VR anymore at this stage. 

&gt;Also the shooting seems a little unnecessary, I think it might work better to make the focus of the game dodging and collecting items.

That's like half the point of the game. If you prefer a straight up runner, may I suggest alternatives like Race the Sun, Distance or AudioSurf?

&gt; 14th December music was the best imo

1548,"This will probably not be a very accurate response since I don't think I have enough diverse experience in making games, but I can tell you how I felt about it.

In my experience I didn't have a 100% clear vision of what I wanted to make. I knew it was a runner, I knew I wanted it to be like Race the Sun but better. I didn't have any idea what I wanted it to look like but I knew one thing tho. The key to making a good game is that it's base mechanic has to be fun and enjoyable. The simplest form of it has to be good, and if that's good anything on top will just make it better. So I had an elongated cube for the ship, a long quad that was the road, and more cubes that were peppered out that were the obstacles and my first task was writing the code for the ship. Everything after that just got implemented as it came to me and got feedback from it.

I basically never had a mindset that ""IT MUST BE LIKE THIS, IT MUST HAVE THIS AND IT MUST PLAY LIKE THIS"". I realize that I'm inexperienced, that if I have a clear vision I won't be able to fulfill it so I just took a leap of faith and did as best I could in every aspect of it.

My personal advice is have courage and just jump in, even if you are scared. Go with the flow, don't try to set a target for your first game, just let yourself lead by it and see where it takes you, you might find it to be better than what you plan. And don't be scared to ask for help! I fucked this up quite badly, but there are people that are willing to help, even for free. I know you will feel like they are trying to take away your glory and alter your baby, and you definitely shouldn't let just anyone touch your project, but if they seem like they know what they are talking about, and you know them and trust them, let them help but make it very clear that it's still your project and you may not implement all of their suggestions.

**TL;DR:** It doesn't really feel bad if you don't have a very specific vision in mind for your game. If you do, take that vision, put it on a shelf, and do a game that's very open to evolve and change over the dev process. You are young, inexperienced and a lot of times naive (as am I) and you will learn a crazy amount in a very short time-span. Do not let your ultimate game vision be executed by an amateur , train yourself first and once you have some experience you can also be pretentious enough work on a clearly-defined project.",2016-03-22 16:16:51+00:00,d199u9y,4.0,t1_d1993z8,967.0,gamedev

1562,"But no man’s sky is a unique game. Or refreshing at least. Space exploration is a genre that has seen very little attention in the last two decades so making a game in this genre is a sure fire way to success. 

Yes you have elite, star citizen, and the X series. You could stretch it to EVE as well but that’s about it for modern times. This field is wiiiiide open for claiming. There are other smaller games trying to take over this genre but most are still in development.

Then look at no man’s sky’s approach to mechanics. Elite, star citizen and eve are very serious and dark games. This is trying to be nice, mysterious and colourful grabbing the attention of more casual gamers as well. In terms of filling a niche they are pretty much spot on with their strategy, be it intentional or not.

For comparison try and make another horror survival game now, like Ark or The forest or H1Z1. You would have to come up with some pretty unique mechanics in order to survive in that overcrowded genre right now. Same with platformers, people are sick of the damn things.

In any case, common HG I cannot wait to play this thing!!

P.S. I have only respect for them for taking a risk and asking for promotion instead of money. Some problems can’t be fixed by throwing money at the. and these guys seem to understand that well. they probably saw that they have enough resources to make the game they wanted so more money would have achieved nothing. 

Also, asking for money usually comes with an exclusivity clause. They would have lost a huge chunk of PC sales if they’ve done that. I can afford a £40 game but I cannot afford a £300 device to play it on just because exclusivity.

Did a uni degree in IT, nothing special and went on into a job as a support engineer for Windows servers. Pretty boring.

The Oculus DK1 comes out and I pre-ordered. But obviously there was no software for it. Read up online about Unity which uses C#, my favourite language, and started messing around. In no time I had a 3D 1st person VR plat former, it was awesome. 

My career progressed pretty quickly and I became a solutions architect for a CMS company. After one too many retarded meetings in which I’m hearing from our billion dollar customer that they don’t have 100K to develop a new sales platform which they badly need to survive, I decided I’m going to stop bragging how I would run a company much better and actually do it!

Tell me again how the Stanley Parable, City Skylines and KSP would have benefited from being made in some other, more performant, heavily-optimized engine or better yet be written in their own dedicated engines? 

Seriously, reading these threads is like reading the Linux vs Microsoft arguments. ""Oh windows is horrible because i can't change the way the kernel works, I can't choose which desktop environment I use, it's very inefficient and uses too much RAM and resources, Microsoft is stealing all of your information"". That's all very nice mate but I rather have all those problems and a working computer that's fairly flexible than have to scour forums and debug code every time my printer driver decides to fail because the companies that write these things don't give a shit about supporting Linux. ""Oh but if more people used windows then the drivers would be better and..."" I really don't care mate, I'm not here to argue with you about political choices, I just want my computer to work and my game to be made at some point in this lifetime.

Thank you very much for making this, feel free to ignore the rest of the comment I just need to shout a little.

To all the people complaining about positional tracking: You can't be fucking serious... No really you can't, I do not fucking believe you are serious. You pretentious, entitled, elitist little shits. You didn't know this existed until 16 hours ago. This is a brand new possibility brought to you to play oculus games without buying the expensive headset and you're already bitching it doesn't have positional tracking? For real? What the fuck gives you the right to complain?

I am sick at how entitled this subredit has become!

So the game is a racing arcade game that uses only keyboard or controller. The menu was designed so that it can be easily navigated with those devices. Why the hell is it a negative that it doesn’t have mouse support in menu? Seriously that boils down to fucking preference at most! 

If it’s an RTS with no mouse support in the menus sure, that’s dumb, you use the mouse for most things but a driving game? What ?

Or how about “The textures in GTA 5 are not high enough when I stick my head against the wall in 1st person mode in 1080p”. Of course they fucking aren’t! GTA 5 is a 60GB game as it stands with a hell of a lot of different textures in it!

1594,"Blizzard is a bit of a gray area when it comes to AAA. Technically they are indie since they don't rely on a publisher to get their game out, then again they are the same as Activision who is a publisher but Blizzard kind of retains some form of independence as a brand.

What I'm trying to say is that it's hard to classify Blizzard games as AAA since they are not a mad dash for cash grabbing every year with the same tired IP. They have 4 major IPs in total spanning 6 different games (SC, WC, Overwatch, Heartstone, Diablo, Heroes of the Storm) and they just keep working on those titles, releasing a new iteration every 5 years or more to update the graphics engine, otherwise content goes back into the same game. They put a lot more care and attention into their games than your EAs or Ubisofts thus people keep playing them as the titles never feel like they're going to eventually die. 

But yeah... gaming is a really inexpensive hobby if you aim to play quality and are willing to do a little digging. However if buying a new $60 FIFA every year is your thing then yes, gaming is fucking expensive.

I think this shift is because AAA focuses on making money, which means getting the maximum amount of dollar out of very limited game time to keep the player spending mullah. However the indies can’t afford to do that so they shine in the only area they feasibly can, mechanics. Every now and again one of these indies will spit out a formula so good that you’re hooked for the next 200 hours or so and thus making the rest of the gaming scene the over-priced craziness that it is.

Game development is a very complex sub-category of programming in general, so that means you need to know how to program first before being able to start game development.

We excuse Bethesda for releasing buggy games.

We excuse Ubisoft for promoting ""in-game footage"" that's not in-game footage.

We excuse Steam for having bloody awefull support.

We excuse everyone for creating pre-order packs at exorbitant prices for very little value.

Nope, sorry I'm done excusing. And I would fully expect my customers / supporters both current and future to be just as strict with me. For example I set the release of my game before Summer 2016. I expect to actually release a lot sooner but in order to give myself enough contingency i set that window. But even then shit can happen that will cause me to delay and in that case my plan is to release a statement detailing exactly why the title is delayed and for how long should it happen.

If GoG realised they couldn't handle what they set out to do, then they just should have made a public statement saying ""Sorry, we tried our best, but there's too many of you for us to handle, so our new policy is this, I hope you understand"".

Thus, when anyone makes a statement, unless otherwise stipulated by a later communication, I expect them to follow through or face scrutiny if they do not and don't justify themselves...

On greenlight you're asked if you, personally would buy this game. Maybe you're someone that only plays RPGs, maybe you're someone who only plays racers. Maybe you don't like the art style. There are a million and one reason why a person would vote no, and it will have to be the combined effort of all of these aspects of a game to appeal to them in order to vote Yes.

For example I profoundly dislike manga-style japnaese ""Interactive stories"". Steam is filled with them and I'm sick of seeing them and I will vote No every time. I'm sure there are plenty that agree, so you'd expect a lot of No votes. But if there are enough Yes votes then there's a market for them still to sell and make money.

If you want the hard truth, in recent times games have gotten on steam with vote ratios of more like 70 no 30 yes. Is it shit? FUCK YES! But it's also justifiable. 

I really wish we would move the discussion away from me personally and onto the fact that steam is winning more and more ground by being this accepting and providing a safe haven for indies like myself. ",2016-02-20 10:53:26+00:00,d06xyou,2.0,t1_d06xcax,2744.0,gamedev

If you work in publishing you will know how long/little a game takes to make. Bare in mind I do the sound, the graphics, the code, the marketing. EVERYTHING. All I don't do is actual QA and Music. I got other individuals for that.

In your first comment, the one that you've now rectified to show that you weren't taking a stab at him, but trying to put into perspective that his games are not up to GOG's standards, which is clearly not what I or the rest of the community gets out of it.

You also come out as aggressive and toxic:

And your rectification on the initial comment right now has appeared very conveniently after several replies of us having a go at each other. But then again it can also be the truth and this is just a huge misunderstanding, but I don't have any sort of evidence of either so I'll keep this judgement to myself.

1787,"&gt; Game development is a business, whether you like it or not. If you don't accept that your game isn't a success then honestly you're not really going to progress.

Game development is also an artform and if his primary purpose was not to make money out of his title then comparing him in turns of revenue from both my side and yours is a completely irrelevant argument. 

&gt; If you don't accept that your game isn't a success then honestly you're not really going to progress.

Success is defined as the accomplishment of an aim or a purpose. If he reached his aim with the two games that he made you can't really come and belittle his achievement just because it doesn't fit with your definition of success for his games. And it's even more interesting that in the next paragraph you already understand that success to him may mean a different thing than for GOG, yourself or a bigger games company

&gt;What is a success to a single indie person is pennies to huge company that is GoG.

So why are you trying to belittle his achievement then if he is happy with it?

&gt;in which there is nothing evil about it, just the truth. You just took it upon yourself to vilify me.

If you believe that I'm trying to vilify you then why are there so many down-votes to your post? If you're making a statement and so many others are disagreeing with you are you 100% sure that you're the one that's correct?

&gt;I didn't bash anyone for their hard work. I make games, I know how hard it is. So how about I give you a little advice: effort does not always correlate with quality. Just because you worked hard on your game doesn't mean it's a high quality game.

I obviously know this, it's reflected by my previous statement of ""NOBODY will give you money just so you can get practice and get better"". That doesn't change the fact that he and I still need more practice but we also need money to live.

&gt;More immature sarcasm?

1789,"&gt; Not sure what's up with the asshole attitude

Yes, the developer that is really proud of his work and invested a lot of time effort and money into his titles really likes being told by a polite and concerned citizen as yourself how to measure his success and what's a good sales figure to him.

&gt; I guess you're all worked up over your mediocre game not being accepted at GoG?

Nope, I'm all worked up about people trying to distance themselves from their initial statement and trying to pretend that we are the ones misunderstanding them. A little bit like:

&gt; I was merely making an observation that while the game is doing OK for an indie game, it's really not that great in terms of the game industry as a whole

""It's just an observation Bro, chill out!"" - where from your initial comment could any of us draw the conclusion that it's ""doing well from an indie game"". Nope, your initial statement is directly targeted and outlining that in your opinion the games are not doing well, there is no ulterior way to interpret it in the form that it's written.

&gt; $28,000 in 1+ year? That's less than average wage.

Unless you live in Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Czech Republic, India, The Ukraine, Hungary, etc. where $28,000 is more than a decent wage for a whole year. But yeah that does require analyzing someone else's situation which is quite difficult to do.

&gt;In short, I don't blame GoG for not wanting to include a game with the graphics of a 30-year-old game on their website, that includes his games and yours.

You are really missing the point here. I'm not blaming them either for wanting to have a high quality store that filters out mediocre stuff, regardless if I consider my game to not be mediocre. I'm blaming them for making a statement and offering a service of feedback and constructive criticism as advertised on their website and NOT delivering on it. I also put into perspective why us ""Mediocre"" devs end up on Steam since it's our best bet at not starving and  is what provides the funding and resources to help us gain experience and get better. You'd be surprised but making games is hard, can be really expensive, frustrating and a lot of time demoralizing and NOBODY will give you money just so you can get practice and get better.

&gt;By the way, how much do you imagine GoG would be getting from his games, if he's getting $28k from Steam in one year? Considering at least 90% of copies are sold on Steam, and they only take 30% (I think?), they'd basically get no more than $1k.

I don't really see why they'd rather have 1K less profit as a business in a year but sure, that's 1K more for steam to provide appalling customer service and locked-down DRM for all in a closed ecosystem :) Excellent work!

EDIT: Just noticed your edit as well. 

&gt; And come on, 18 reviews in one entire year, 77% positive. Are you really going to tell me that's a successful game? If that's the case you're really aiming pretty low.

For his first and second games ever? Uhm... yeah that's alright. His first game isn't Air Traffic Control Simulator or some crappy flash game, they are fully fleshed out titles made by one person. But again you're not really trying to judge at the correct level you seem to want to pit him and me against the superstars of gaming development and everything less shouldn't even be considered up for debate.

1792,"&gt; technelly steam has users in a DMR

Yep that's what I said and it's also why I'm not the biggest fan of it. If steam dies tomorrow all my games as both a consumer and a developer are poof!

&gt; you just basically turn tails and give in to peer pressure

Not quite... I turned tails into profits. I love making games but another thing i love is eating... and electricity... and playing other people's games which cost money. Steam have accepted me onto their store to help me with that... gog didn't...

&gt; you didnt follow GOG.com rules, so yes you should have known that this will happen

What rules? the only rules I saw were the ones posted on their page that I linked to and I followed those ones. And since I see now that I'm not by far the only one with this problem it means that there are some really obscure rules that make no sense or that the process is completely random

&gt; one mistake you did was not research, if you look up websites that are better than steam you should have seen itch.io has the only website that helps indie developers.

I'm sorry, I didn't find itch.io when i searched initially. I found Gog, desura, indiedb, humble bundle store and that's about it. I'll definitely look into it but in my defense, as a one man band working 20 hours a day on this some things will slip through the cracks. 

&gt; lastly steam didnt help with PR, that was your hard work that done that

Steam provided a platform through which their community can have a look at my game through trailers and videos and decide weather they like it or not. It provides me with valuable feedback on my game's quality and appeal, while at the same time opens the possibility to sell through their platform. Yes I have to put in work to make my game appealing to those people, but without steam those people would have probably never seen it or judge it. For comparison's sake, on my own merits and powers. The company twitter account has existed for 20 days now and it only has 44 followers. That is something I have to manage daily in order to promote and expose to wider audiences, which costs me A HELL OF A LOT MORE than a one time fee of £70 

&gt;  you still have much to learn and by the time you see this message a bunch of fanboy steam users would downvote it.

If they do, it's probably because of this statement mostly. You're trying to justify your above arguments by blaming the ""fanboys"" for hating on your claims. 

&gt;if anything don't place all your hope in steam, you will be threaten, your games lose valve (steam sales do hurt), and pr only last for a certain time.

I'm sorry but this just doesn't make any sense. Who's going to threaten me and for what reason? Yes steam sales do hurt but I rather have a discounted sale every once in a while than no sale at all. It's like language locked games. I want people in... Romania for example to buy my game and play it and enjoy it, but I'm also aware that where $10 for an American is popcorn cinema money, for a Romanian it represents food for 2 days. So I translate my game in Romanian and make it available to them for $4 so they can experience it and I still make a little extra cache I wouldn't make otherwise.

Yes, steam sales do give a few people the opportunity to buy your game at a discount price making you less money than it otherwise would, but it also makes the game more accessible to more individuals, and If I have to skip on a new Ferrari for that to happen so be it.

As for PR lasting a certain time, yes it does... but that's true for all PR, it's not something related to just Steam, it's a universal fact.",2016-02-20 04:13:47+00:00,d06q8es,2.0,t1_d06nmwd,5174.0,gamedev

(7500/2)*2.49 + (7500/2)*9.99 = 9,337.5 + 37,462.5 = $46,800 revenue

Turning our attention to I Can't Escape: Darkness. Retail price 11.99, discount price 5.99, has sold more than 1200 coppies. Applying the same formula:

(1200/2) * 11.99 + (1200/2) * 5.99 = 7,194 + 3,594 = $10,788 revenue

FUCK early access okay? To death!

It's destroyed so many good games / concepts. It has helped a lot as well, making things like Kerbal Space Program possible but at the same time it has made devs lazy! Really lazy!

I've pondered it for a long time. Here are my thoughts on the matter: If I get it into early access, people will get it earlier allowing for some money to come in sooner. But if the money's coming in, will I be so motivated to make a truly good game? I mean if there are bugs, i can always shove the ""It's early access bro"" banner in their face. Then if enough money comes in, will I even need to finish it? I mean... money was made, success was had, why bother making more.

Early access is thus far pretty much a plague allowing devs to shun excuses at their customers. And if you keep it in early access for long enough, you will reach a point where people accept your game as just being good, but buggy. No Bethesda, releasing a game as a buggy mess is NOT FUCKING OKAY!

The most disgusting job about gamedev is bugfixing, because you have to revisit your code, the one you may have wrote 1 month ago without any comments because you were lazy, and you have to find this one specific line that does this once specific thing in a one specific circumstance. It's boring, it's difficult and it's not rewarding for the most part. BUT THAT'S OKAY, just call it early access and you can do it... at some point.

1825,"Ok then:

&gt; God I wish I could unplay that

I'm truly sorry you didn't enjoy it. A lot of people invested a lot of hours trying to make a good experience for everyone and we hoped that by proving a free demo, enough gameplay footage and screenshots as well as an accurate description of the features as possible without spoiling too much of the game we would spare everyone from having to play something they don't want to.

As you wish to unplay it, we assume that you've already played the demo so we'd like to understand what caused a disconnect between our standard media (photos, videos, text, etc) and the game itself. What was the key feature/bug/issue that made you hate it so much which was not outlined by the videos or screenshots on the steam page before trying the demo?

&gt; Also when did this sub allow people to advertise whatever and whenever they want?

The PCMasterRace sub has always had some degree of advertisment built into it, because the truth is PCs are not manufactured by everyone from dust, they are made from components made by manufacturers and thus some degree of advertising is unavoidable when talking about these components, or all things PC related. This is also true for every other subreddit out there since enterprises are a big part of our lives.

As to why Void 21 made it on here, personally I hope it's because most people find it enjoyable. The game was designed to appeal to the PCMR community as much as possible, since I am a member of that community and I agree that everyone should be able to enjoy a game on the hardware they have and not be tied to a specific resolution, quality, platform or preset. However there would be no point in making a game if nobody gets to look at it and play it. Like any other artform, it only brings value once its experienced and if people don't talk about it and discuss it, how will it be experienced?

Finally one of the best reasons for it being on the PCMR subreddit is because this subreddit is critical. Very critical. I am extremely honored it reached here and people in general are accepting it and furthermore are being critical of it to help us improve upon our work. I value the opinions of my brethren very much and as such I love to hear what they have to say about it, positive and negative.

1882,"I honest to god gave it my best on the Gear VR i really did :( I have the edge + with the headset right here on my desk. It just doesn't work. 

To outline a few problems:

- Anisotropic filtering doesn't work on the S6 period, and can only do 2x on the Note 6 and Edge 6+. For reference Anisotropic filtering is what makes far away textures look good when viewed at an angle. My game is based heavily on textures that need to look sharp as possible to be pleasant so I depend a lot on ansio working but if you try and play it with it turned off it looks horrible. I'd have to change the whole art-style to make it compatible and it's not something I'd like to do :(

- The game is extremely responsive and the controls are really tight so when your controller doesn't respond within a couple of milliseconds it gets really annoying really fast. All the BT controllers for android that I've tried have a lag to varying degrees which makes the experience not so fan. You can adapt to them if you want to but it is annoying and unfair.

- Anti aliasing is again not very stellar on android phones and when you game is made mostly of straight lines with the screen sitting 2 inches away from your face you are going to notice it really really badly. Couple that with the screendor effect it makes for a bad experience. 

I might give it another shot post-release if there's enough interest.",2016-02-09 19:39:50+00:00,cztsrad,4.0,t1_cztsb76,592.0,oculus

I mean it was by no means designed from the ground up to be VR exclusive and have features that are only truly experienced in VR so what you're saying could be very true.

But a few people have expressed desire for this:

Yes you do... If I say ""it ""feels"" like the natizs knew what they were doing"" dose that mean I'm saying it because I want feedback on my feelings?

&gt;It seems like you really want to argue with me when I have no stake in this and was just curious as to the intentions of your game regarding race the sun.

I don't want to argue with you, I honestly don't want to argue with anyone as it is indeed invested energy that I loose. But you are making a false claim in the public domain about my title without any backing, which I have to counter as there are other people reading our conversation and they form opinions based on these conversations about me, you, my game and what it stands for, thus I have to answer you because if I choose not to I am no better at justifying myself than a big AAA claiming that consoles don't hold back PC Game development (for example)

&gt; My recommendation was that you try to give a less argumentative answer.  Instead, you've spent a lot of emotional energy responding to me.

Yes... because that's what one does in a conversation... You're basically saying that you don't want an answer from me on the statement you provided because I have to invest energy to answer you... On a discussion board... what?

1890,"&gt; wow. Take a chill pill.

Wouldn't that be bad for my health? I mean taking pills to calm me down when I'm already calm surely is bad for me.

&gt;I didn't say ""This is a direct copy"". I said it seems like a direct copy, and then I asked if that was the point.

I in no way insinuated that you made a direct statement. I said ""I would love to hear why you believe the game is a direct copy"" which is accurate as you are hinting towards that conclusion without providing any arguments to back it up.

&gt;Now, it seems like the answer is yes. You liked race the sun but you thought you could make it even better. That's fine! That's how pretty much every form of art works.

This statement makes no sense to me, n-or how you've drawn that conclusion. I went on to explain how I'm not trying to make a direct copy and further more given reason which you've not countered in any way as to why the title neither is or is trying to ""seem"" like a direct copy. A copy means that I'm targeting to be as similar to my inspiration points as possible when in reality I'm doing the exact opposite, as specified above. 

&gt; So, in the future, a better answer would be: ""Yes - we thought we could make race the sun even better, but there are some notable differences in controls and style, along with new gametypes. And Yes, we are working closely with developers.""

I disagree, that is a vague answer which gives no detail, intention or credibility to my claim. It's a very shallow blanket statement that allows for plenty of room to interpret and go back on my own words. For example ""there are some notable differences in controls and style, along with new gametypes"" can be made true by just changing the color pallet of the game to be blue instead of white for example, and then have the ship control with WASD instead of arrow keys. These are both notable differences as you will notice them, but they are not significant in showing that you are actually not trying to copy your sources, but improve upon them

Finally while  you are incorrect in assuming I am not ""chill"" you are correct in assuming I am upset. Here's why:

- You've started the conversation with a vague, broad and shallow statement with no backing or factual statements of your claims.
- Upon being countered you've completely transformed the answer that was given to you in the exact opposite without stating why you've done so
- You've recommended that in future I provide broad vague statements as to my intentions as opposed to precise and detailed ones, which leave more room for interpretation and misleading and that's something I really do not appreciate.",2016-02-09 15:38:10+00:00,czti6jj,4.0,t1_czth2rk,1772.0,oculus

1892,"Direct copy, could you back your claim with some arguments? I'm in no way intending to make a direct copy. [And yes I actually have had discussions with the creators and they are aware of its existance](https://twitter.com/taranasus/status/694284032964726784) however I do not require permission from them as I am not intending to make a copy of their title, or infringe on any intellectual property they may own. I merely want to make a title in the same genre to push the gamestyle further. 

Here are my counters to your retort so far:

1. Void 21 has weapons which you can unlock and equip to fight back

2. The ship is fully upgradable and customizable in terms of speed, firepower, maneuverability and special abilities

3. Void 21 can be played as both a runner and a bullet hell, although there is still more development needed on the bullethell part.

4. There is a seed picker allowing you to replay level sections that you really enjoyed and share them with other people.

5. We've gone for a more textured aesthetic with inspiration from outrun 1980's style art as well as old dos 3d-like graphics

6. We are probably, most notably, not racing the sun which is kind of key in Race the Sun's gameplay. 

Having said all of that, I think Race the Sun is a fantastic game and has inspired me to try and improve on the genre, but in no way am I intending to make an exact replica of it... that's pointless.

You have to be careful when increasing the physics loop. This will put a strain on the processor and if you want your game to run on low end system, doing 144 physics loops/second rather than 50 can cause some dire consequences. 

THAT BEING SAID, I can see the value of having an option to toggle this on/off/auto depending on the users settings. I could write a little code to detect the screen refresh rate and adjust the physics loop accordingly for the Auto bit, and then have manual toggles for those that like to tinker.

Hello I heard a challenge! 

Unity is .NET code and as such has a garbage collector. When you instantiate variables within the game loop your going to be instantiating a lot of different memory spaces which makes your ram go through the roof. Luckily there’s the garbage collector that stops this from happening but the GC is not run very often so when it is run you re going to be smacked over the face with a CPU spike as the GC is doing its job. And that’s how you get frame drops and angry customers. So your best options are to prioritize:

A. Referencing 

B. Reusing variables

C. Declare global ones

D. Declare local ones",2016-02-04 02:06:35+00:00,czn2fk7,7.0,t1_czmk1yw,26175.0,pcmasterrace

1968,"Good question my good man!

&gt; but how stable is that assembly when it's expanded? Seems like it'd eventually fail if enough downward force was applied

So as per the technical spec of the arm ansamble: Ultra heavy duty ""C"" clamp, Extra heavy duty steel construction: up to 10 kgs per monitor or 60 Kgs in total.

Now these things are actually designed to withstand more weight than 10kg per arm but to account for any manufacturing defects on some units they put down a lower maximum weight than they can take. Now as you can imagine a joystick doesn't have anywhere near 10kg so it's not a problem weight-wise even with the extensions. Honestly the biggest point of failure is the desk itself, i would much rather expect the clamp to bit out of the desk if i put enough pressure on it than anything else. 

&gt; Do you just have to manually adjust tension when you're compacting/expanding it and tighten it when you're using it?

No. The HOTAS is very sensitive and smooth so it doesn't take much force to operate, thus it will stay in place no problem. I've tightened the screws on the arms so that it takes a little bit of force to push them back under the desk but it's not a strain at all.  And the best part about it, because they swivel, when they are fully deployed they sit almost in a straight line in front of me so if i put in frontal or backwards force, all of it just goes into the metallic arm and not the joint itself.

The way it works with Europe is you take that price, convert to currency, + 25% VAT and then round to the closest nice-looking sum. So we take 999$ and convert to euros = 913.33 +25% = 1141... so most likely 1150 euros or even better 1199 cause who cares anymore when it's that high. Because I'm British that's about £899 for the Vive or £530 for the Oculus. It's a hefty sum but hey it's cheaper than an 8K TV :)

Oh and if people are wondering how the fuck I got to 25%, it's pretty much a value to cover VAT for most european countries. In Germany it's 19%, int the UK it's 20%, Denmark is 25%, Hungary is 27% you get the point. Looking at oculus.

2138,"Sir, you win commenter of the year award. Very nice and well rounded points. Rest assured I'm taking the feedback from everyone and making them into a few bulletpoints for me to implement later on. Onto your suggestions:

&gt;You need to make the track smaller.

I've mentioned this before in here, a lot of the aspects of the level are controlled via a seed. I do not have the resources or time to dedicate to modelling levels so math will have to do my work for me. Map width is just another parameter controlled by the seed as well as density, number of enemies, etc. [Here's a narrow level](http://void21.com/images/narrowLevel.jpg), [and here's a very overloaded one](http://void21.com/images/max%20difficulty.jpg).

&gt;The second most important thing I would change is the lines on the floor.



Will do, I'll look at the best way of doing it. It did used to have horizontal lines but I needed to remove them. The Gear VR doesn't support anisotropic all that well so looking at them at an angle created a very nasty effect. With aniso turned off they would pop-out and pop-in based on distance so they had to go. I'll revisit the lines to see what looks right.

&gt;The third thing is that your coloring is inconsistent and sometimes hard to see on obstacles and enemies. Some are red, while others are blue. Why? What is the difference?

Stationary obstacles that move only on a predetermined path, or don't move at all, are blue. Intelligent obstacles that follow you in some way or another are red. More rules and colours to come. As for the rockets I'll need to do some more tweaking, They basically come from far back paralel and above the road and then smack in front of you but this effect gets diminished as you go faster so i'll need to revisit it.

&gt; but your #1 mechanic (movement) doesn't have any interesting flare or skill other than moving left or right

Actually there is the ability to accelerate and break, i just need to add some visual queues to make it more obvious. When I jump at the end, I accelerate at will. Break is in there too. I will add two fins to the ship that will come out as you break to represent air brakes and I will make the engine beams bigger as you accelerate. 

Finally thanks for suggesting games to get inspired from, apart from Race the Sun all I had was a picture of Deadpool to look at. 

Also, to mention, there will be guns. It won't be just a runner, if you want to outrun the enemies or shoot through them it will be your choice, or maybe a combination of both? The ship will have mount points and you'll unlock upgrades as you progress. It's very hard to mention this all in one video, I think I'll have to post again down the line when I have a more comprehensive show-off. 

But again, Thanks fro the awesome comment, it's really appreciated.",2015-12-20 22:48:08+00:00,cy5xybz,2.0,t1_cy5w8z8,2768.0,Unity3D

- The ground lines hurt my eyes when you strafe. - I need to look into this then. You're the second person to mention it so I have to do something about it. 

- The music fits the game type - Music is hard, I have about 7 looping songs but i'm shit at music and buying it costs a little money. Trying to add more as i go

- Those random balls that appear out of nowhere seem impossible to doge - seem impossible but obviously are not. I am going for the kind of punishy feel and before you say ""yes but it seems unfair to the player"", they all can be doged as I have shown, you just have to learn their pattern - and I am incredibly shit at this.

- The ground pads that make you jump are not visible enough, maybe add a small icon that hovers on top of them? - Agreed, still a work in progress those. They need to also be wider. When you're going fast they are quite hard to hit.

- The ever changing obstacles, you freeze them when the player gets close otherwise it will result in many instakills that would frustrate the player no? - No because the level is always identical, learn the pattern of the level and you'll be fine. Plus you can accelerate and break so...

- The big V shaped obstacles present no real challenge, they are not surrounded by a sufficient amount of smaller obstacles, i see no problem in avoiding them. - [there are more difficult levels ](http://void21.com/images/max%20difficulty.jpg) and those v-shapes are actually windmills that have variable speeds.

- What is your solution to avoid a repetitive gameplay experience? - Unlockable upgrades and guns, unlockable enemies with different game styles, secret gag/unique seeds, some boss fights at specific key points in your progression.

- Any options to slow down / accelerate (boost) the vehicle? Any power ups? - Yes / yes. There will be power-ups, there will also be guns, A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GUNS - i love guns. I might also make the base level destructible if the gear vr can take the punishment.

- Those red squares.. what is their purpose? - I call it the train, it actually moves towards you at constant speed but you can't tell when going that fast. Need to tweak it. ",2015-12-20 19:33:48+00:00,cy5qklt,2.0,t1_cy5q2tz,798.0,Unity3D

2218,"
I'm really torn about this to be honest:

On one side, you're right. The game is not particularly nice to look at, it's filled with bugs and broken NPC logic and animations like you wouldn't believe. Zombies get stuck on ledges, two headed cows spaz out, broke a few quests quite a few times by doing actions i'm not supposed to ahead of time. It's like QA didn't really exist for this piece. As both a developer, with my SO a QA tester we are horrified by this mess.

On the other, I've played it, a lot! It's fun enough to actually make me look past all of the glitches and bugs and crap textures because I have a genuine good time in the game. There is so much stuff to do in this game it's ridiculous and most stories are really well written and thought out. I have an emotional connection with my character and the loss of her child and husband, the quest to find the kid, the hardship of all the people in the world. 

I would be an absolute asshole to belittle a game that I genuinely enjoy playing, yet at the same time I really don't agree with how it looks and the lack of QA. Heavens I have to play it in 1080p because if I bump it to 4K it looks worse because of the bad textures. I didn't buy the latest Batman because of the performance issues and I'm still not going to buy it and probably will end up never playing it, but this game I enjoy more than a lot of other recent titles. 

It manages to strike a balance between all of its elements that makes me keep coming back. 

Bethesda is probably going to get away with this one, they've made too good a story that caries the title despite its downsides, but this won't work forever. Their next game may not be so good or so lucky to carry it just on gameplay alone and it will hurt them in the future. I'm not going to defend them for the mess they've put out but I can't say that Fallout 4 is a bad game either. 

I guess we just need to wait and see what the future holds.

NOTE: I only bought this game on release day after watching reviews put out by youtubers. I was fully aware of the buginess of the title before purchasing and the state of its graphical capabilities but still chose to purchase it despite those issues. It just looked that fun and it actually turned out to live up to the reviewer's claims. ",2015-11-12 14:15:11+00:00,cwxoaff,1.0,t3_3shv07,37153.0,pcmasterrace

2223,"iPad mini…

Every Apple hater will die reading this but let me explain. I am an apple hater. I hate the company, I fucking hate iPhones and MacBook pros and even iPads. Why? They are expensive and underpowered pieces of shit that restrict and lock you in their ecosystem every chance they get. iOS especially is arse. I have to go to the home screen, then to settings, then to wi-if section, then select wifi etc. Why can’t I just long tap the damn wifi icon in the little pull up menu to get there instantly?

HOWEVER: the iPad mini 2 wifi 16 gb costs £ 219. This is a device that costs a third of an iPhone but does everything a smartphone does, very snappy and smooth,  in a slim and narrow form-factor. At £219 new it’s not expensive and as a complementary device to use just for entertainment it is amazing. 

“Common taranasus you can do all that on your phone” . Yes I can,  but currently if my ipad runs out of juice (and mind you the battery life on it is amazing) my phone is still perfectly fine to aid me with my gps and boarding pass needs, with battery almost full. 

As a traveler, this is the best media device. It’s reliable, it allays works, and it costs less than most airplane return tickets.

Whoever needs to actually budget and save up in order to buy the game can either: 

A. Save up $60 expecting it to cost as much as most other game
B. Wait for the game to be released, then save up the money and buy it.

Expecting a lower price point for a game just because it's made by an indie is rather stupid. All games require developers, designers, modelers, artists and managers to be made. The only difference between an indie and AAA is the amount of money invested into marketing. With NMS it is even more true since they developed their own game engine for this...

Weather they announce it for example 3 months before saying it will cost $60 and will release on date X or announce on date X directly that it's released and costs $60, it will piss off the same exact people. 

You could even argue that if they announce it now that it will cost $60 without us knowing much of anything about it, there would be people that would become disinterested to wait another 3 months for something they consider to expensive and stop following the game alltogether.

2266,"Correct. As it's just as awe inspiring when you zoom out for the first time and realize how much stuff is actually there.

Comparing on the number of planets would be just plain silly, since both games use procedural generation to get these star systems in place. Weather you're making 400 billion, or 1.8 trillion or however many both games have it's not really all that relevant considering all of these systems are made by mathematical rules. Past a certain number it becomes pointless how many there actually are.

As for the exploration part. E:D Horizons is coming out SOON^TM which allows for non-atmospheric planetary landing and exploration. Planetary landings and exploration of Atmospheric planets will follow in a future expansion. 

However none of this makes any difference because they are two completely separate games with completely separate play stiles. Elite is trying to be a simulator as much as possible, NMS (at least from the released footage) is going to be an arcady and fun exploration game.

There is plenty of room for both and I'm sure as hell playing both :D

2277,"I saw a lot of people replying to your comment trying to explain either themselves or their spouses with regards to your little statement over there.

While I'm a big fan of self-delusion, you need to know that you are correct in your thinking.

Here's the deal as I see it: If your current so cheated on a past one he is more likely than not to do it again to you. That doesn't mean they will, but because of past experience they have the knowledge and skill to do it which makes it easier for them and that is quite a burden to carry around in a relationship.

If your SO has already done it to you, you have to think of the underlying reason: was it me, was it them, were they bored, was the relationship stale, what happened, how did it get here? etc. This will explain why the relationship went wrong. Then there's the fact that you have to realize that sex and the lack of cheating, in a relationship, is a rule that's been developed by humans in a couple almost instinctively in order to prove their loyalty to one another. After all sex itself is not that big a deal, it's just a fun activity you have, and when it's made with love is even better, but it's just a simple activity and should be easy enough to obey by both partners not to cheat. If one of them cheats, it's an awesome flag to indicate that the relationship can't stand on its own for some reason or another.

Of course there are odd examples and edge cases to this, but you'll see that it's a pretty good theory to live by.

2345,"While I do realize that some of my arguments are made based on speculation due to lack of statements made by HTC/Valve, I expect them to be as competitive as they can be. But let's keep this going, it's fun :D

&gt; As you pointed out, that's going to give them lots of exposure in a really short amount of time. I still don't think that compares to all the exposure we've had to the Rift

But it does, because you have to consider the target audience. Yes Oculus has been exposed to the general population through traditional media but the Vive, via Steam, will be exposed directly to a huge community of Gamers, the exact target audience of the current generation devices. 

&gt; Yes, but Vive users will have the same limitation, so it's scalable

Yeah but this links to my statement above. By advertising through steam they are going to be exposing the technology to the people that have powerful machines. It's a much better focused advertising campaign than Oculus, as they can funnel the exposure just to the people that matter for this generation of hardware.

Also I'm really scared that due to the improper advertising done by oculus, average Joe with his laptop will buy an oculus because he heard about it and will run like a dog for him due to the fact that he doesn't understand what minimum system requirements are, an then he starts complaining about it and I'm sure you know how the story goes from here. 

The long term is a different story. And honestly it's too early to think about 2nd-3rd generation devices and how they will do when we don't have concrete adoption rate data on 1st gen. 

&gt; They might, but that's speculation that isn't based on any statement they've made

Yes, but if we are thinking long-term we have to assume potential strategies and possibilities of competitiveness. You don't predict the market by just analyzing statements and nothing else.

&gt;  I still consider Oculus at least 60% directly responsible for it. Not in the way that Oculus is driving people to improve VR by simply existing, but in that Oculus scientists actually invented most of the components in the headset.

In that perspective I consider Oculus partly responsible for every other HMD that's being made right now. They opened the manufacturer's eyes to the possibility of profit by creating these devices so Lucky is at fault for his own product and the competitor ones. With Samsung it's just a partnership of which they get to see some money as well. 

&gt; Me too, but again, that's unconfirmable speculation, which really isn't fair to use in a debate, because until something is announced, they're able to surprise us in anyway they want.

Again, we're debating how these products can and may take over as the market leader. I can't base my analysis purely on what they announce as that is simply unwise. As it is human nature to lie, withhold the truth and any information that we believe may benefit out growth so do companies, and I have to take this very unfortunate fact into account when doing predictions in order to be as accurate as I can.

It is also very true that they came in very late into the game and are now playing catch-up, so just because they haven't announced it yet doesn't mean that a device isn't in the works. A device which very well may be almost ready and will be announced and/or released to compete with the Gear. But I'll drop this argument as we're talking PC vr. 

&gt;I meant that they gave it to select developers rather than opening it up to everyone as Oculus did, making it so they just don't have as many kits in developer hands, which naturally means not as many people are working with it.

Can't really argue with this, I'm a bit sore about it as well since I wanted to buy a dev kit to stick next to my oculus collection. But at the end of the day I can't hold it as a black mark against them either because their time to manufacture was a hell of a lot shorter. As they are trying to be first to the market it does mean not being able to create enough dev kits to make them accessible to all, but there's also the fact that the dev kits that were provided [were free](https://virtualrealityreporter.com/htc-vive-developer-edition-free/). So they are not trying to recup the costs of their dev kits directly like oculus did. 

&gt;My first purchase will probably be the Rift though mostly because I think it'll have more content at it's start.

My first purchase will probably be a Vive as I want the full room experience. To be able to draw in 3D is one of my dreams since I was a kid and the Vive will make it possible. Also I will admit do being a little sneaky and will try to see if I can discover how to trick the oculus runtime into thinking that the Vive is a rift to try and play the rift games as well. When it comes down to it the devices are pretty much the same thing and I'm not a fan of platform exclusivity, but the Vive is offering hand tracking and me wantz disssss.",2015-09-18 05:02:29+00:00,cv5kic5,5.0,t1_cv538p1,30976.0,virtualreality
2346,"&gt;I'm not a fanboy, just realistic, there is no way in Hell the Vive will be more popular than the Rift.

Good, so you won't mind a friendly argument then :)

&gt; Trust me, Oculus couldn't care less what Vive is doing

Business-wise, that would be plain dumb. You keep your friends close and your enemies closer. If they are smart, they'll be analyzing their competition upside-down, inside-out and so on. Considering these to companies are competing for a brand new market, it could even be wise to have a team of a few individuals solely dedicated to analyzing what the competition is doing and scoring the potential relevance and success of the products/features they are offering. 

&gt;Yes, Vive is having a limited release before the CV1 release, but honestly, no one but the most enthusiastic VR lovers even knows what the Vive is. Oculus has had thousands of VR headsets out in the real world for years now, many of which have been demoed quite a lot. They've been demoing their HMD all around the world for the same amount of time.

Absolutely correct apart from one small little thing you're omitting to mention. HTC and Valve have Steam. Steam is no laughing matter, steam is a massive online retailer that already has VR features and is incorporating even more. As soon as the Vive actually launches and they want to commercialize it it's going to be on the front page of that thing with big bold letters. You won't be able to get rid of the advertising. Approx 9 million people use steam each day so the exposure to the Vive is going to be very very sudden. 

&gt;Oculus is giving us more options, allowing us to buy the headset without motion controllers, useful as most games have so far been designed that way. This allows for more people to find something that fits their needs.

Nothing stopping you from using a controller with the Vive although I do understand where you're coming from with not being able to just buy the headset without all the attached gear. There's always the possibility that maybe down the line Valve will sell a VIVE + Steam Controller bundle to compete with Oculus directly but on the other hand I'm not their Sales+Marketing team. 

&gt; Oculus has been in TV commercials and on the cover of magazines. 

That's not going to help them much. The minimum system requirements for VR are waaayyy of the scale of what the average PC owner has in their house and I don't see the average PC owner taking a leap of faith and buying a $700 PC just for VR. Traditional media publicity is good for brand recognition, and may help them long-term, but that's about it.

&gt; When CV1 is released, Oculus will be demoing their headset all over the the place in brick and mortar stores.

I would be extremely surprised if HTC won't be doing the same thing. They're a massive phone manufacturer and they know the importance of demoing their products.

&gt; They are the only company that we know of that's capitalizing on mobile VR

Almost correct but we're talking about PC VR, whole other market section. It's Samsung that are actually diving in head first into mobile VR. Also considering HTC is making the VIVE I'm kind of expecting a competitor in that segment soon(TM)

&gt;  I've heard many times someone talking about VR and they use the word ""Oculus"" when they mean ""VR"". That's not uncommon, and it really shows how much thought they put into getting people to think ""Oculus"" when VR is brought up.

Inventor's advantage :) and because of that advantage I have to Oculus products in my house, but it's far off from being a decisive factor in determining the next big HMD

&gt; It'll take a few years for people to become as familiar with Vive as they already are with Oculus, and even then, Oculus will have only become even more well known.

No, because Steam. 

&gt; what has Vive done to get support? Demoed it to like 2 or 3 events, drove a bus around demoing it to small towns in the U.S., and have shipped to a few developers. That doesn't come close to scratching what Oculus has done.

Demoed it to every event they could since it was announced, hell I'm going to demo it next weekend in Birmingham UK at EGX. 

Drove a truck/bus whatever it is to raise awareness

A few developers is a bit of an understatement. I mean hell Google, HBO and Unreal are just some of their partners. And let's not forget, if Valve really really really want to sell this thing like stupid, all they have to do is make a VR-exclusive Portal or Half Life game. I know at least three people that said they would buy the Vive no matter the cost if Valve launch one of their popular titles for it.

2360,"&gt;the detail increase i was wondering from 1080p to 1440p i was kind of assuming that the games textures needed to be made with more detail for the benefit of a higher res(1440p) to come out, is this true?

It is but at the same time it's not. Most games these days, especially PC titles are built in such a way that the textures should look good up to a 4K screen. Considering this is a title that should run for a few years, it needs to be future proof so a good assumption would be that the textures were made so they look good even on a 4k screen. 

There are tricks you can do to actually make badish textures look good at very high resolution. Trick one is to do what Portal 2 did: because there are not many colors and complex images to speak of when it comes to textures, the game looks incredible [even on a 4K screen](http://xavier.site.nfoservers.com/uploads/naitiveresolution.png). Second thing you can do is bump the anisotropic filtering as high as possible, something you can do on a PC with ease. [Here's a sample of anisotropic filtering on and off](http://international.download.nvidia.com/webassets/en_US/shared/images/embed/aa-af-guide/filtering.jpg), pay attention to the road texture. 

&gt; i think i would like more area on the top and bottom with a 16:10 1660p, wish a 120hz or 144hz one existed.

It's always a bastard this one... you always have to sacrifice framerate for resolution and vice versa until technology reaches the level to provide both. If you're getting a nvidia card, i highly recommend pairing it with a G-Sync monitor in order to avoid taring. Read up a little on G-sync to understand what it does but it's highly recommend it.
 
16:10 is a pretty non-standard format so you'll be really hard pressed to find a monitor at that resolution and at 144hz. I'd recommend if you really want the framerate, just go 1440p and get something [like this](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MO-077-AC&amp;groupid=17&amp;catid=948). I for one am a resolution fanatic and went with a 4k screen because I like seeing all the juicy details. Plus when your resolution gets so high (4k) the need for anti-aliasing no longer exists, as the pixels are so small jagged edges become unnoticeable. I at home have [this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/AMH-A399U-UHD-39-5-3840X2160-16-9-4K-LED-Monitor-60Hz-DP1-2-HDMI2-0-/321724749333?hash=item4ae84a1615) but it's too big for most people so a more sensible option is [this](https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MO-065-AC&amp;groupid=17&amp;catid=948).",2015-09-08 07:42:35+00:00,cuu89ob,3.0,t1_cuu7ckn,3417.0,NoMansSkyTheGame

2363,"Ooookay wow, that's an overwhelming amount of questions. I'll try and answer everything, but for best results what you want to do is head up to /r/buildapc and post this question there. In any case:

&gt;im assuming im gonna need a really good graphics card or 2 so everything loads around me far enough and fast enough for me not to be able to see any unloaded stuff if possible.

You're talking about draw distance and while you do need a better graphics card to have a bigger draw distance this is also limited by the developers themselves in code. So you can have 4 titans tied with a string, if the developer didn't give you an option to increase the draw distance far enough it's not going to help. This game is also made for the PS4 so a general rule of thumb is if you want an experience as good you just need a very little bit more powerful of a PC.

&gt;does a game need to be made for 60+ hz for you to get a benefit from using a 60+ hz monitor? i want to get a 120hz or 144hz, perhaps an overclock-able 60hz.

Kind of... So the way a game works is that every time a new frame is drawn on the screen some code gets executed in the background. Some developers (usually bad one) tie physics and logic code in with this framerate code, which means if the game runs faster (70fps, 80fps etc) the physics elements (falling boxes, traveling bullets, etc) happen faster and more violently and that gives you a bad experience. Good developers don't do this, so the phisycs code works in its own separate section from the graphics code, which allows you to run the game at whatever fps you want/ your hardware can take. Weather HG is a good developer with unlocked fame rate or a bad developer with locked frame rate it's left to be seen.

If the game has a locked frame rate of 30fps or 60fps you can have the best monitor in the world, it's not going to make a difference. 

If you have the money to spend, get a 144hz monitor as that will cover both basis. Just remember that if the game can run at 144fps you also need a graphics card powerful enough to run it at 144fps.

&gt;can we speculate how much a higher resolution(1440p) will improve in game detail and visuals in no mans sky?

[This image](http://www.digitalstorm.com/unlocked/images/articles/Nav/Articles/GTA5-4kvs1080p-4.jpg) of gta 5 demonstrates the benefit of using 2160p over 1080p. From this you can deduce that any resolution (1600p over 1440p) would be better as it shows more it's just not going to be as drastic of a difference as the one demode in that picture.

&gt;does 1600p compared to 1440p increase detail and visuals or just add more area on the top and bottom?

I'm afraid in this case you're just going to see more of the top and the bottom of the in-game image. [The purple](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xkhn8rrZfXkVvP6UUiziCcRyFf774uaU2qWrDshGanDKjrpHWaXXvdovFnvo9jOtnuJqZ06EAklQ4_rNTqGP0RsRqLqHnM3q53Xw7mHCcoL5i2aoUnc0VDY_xw) is the amount of more pixels you get over 1440p so it's not that much.

&gt;do we know if no mans sky will support 16:10 without subtracting area from the left and right?

While there is nothing confirmed it is a safe assumption that it will support this. 

&gt;does the game have to be made to support different aspect ratios like 16:10 for it to add more area while not subtracting area from the left and right in comparison with 16:9?

Technically yes, the game has to be made to support this but it's not really difficult to get it done so chances are (90% chance) that it will support different aspect ratios correctly.

&gt;if i want to run at 120 fps or 144 fps fps on a 120hz or 144hz 1440p 27"" or 1600p 30"" monitor. will one 980ti oc water cooled be enough or do i need a titan or 2 980ti's?

It's really hard to say at this point but I think one 980ti will do. I run most of my games at 4K60fps (2160p) on a GTX 970. The 980ti runs rings around my card, you don't want to run at the same resolution but you do want a higher fps. I think one 980ti is enough. A Titan when it comes to gaming is in some cases worse than the 980ti so stick with that. 

&gt;it sounds like pascal is gonna give a huge boost to gpu's. so maybe i should wait and get a 1080p right now.

The next big thing will always look shiner and be better. Every time. If you always wait you'll find yourself in a waiting loop. If you have the money for it now and want to get it now, its as good a time as any.

That is a bit too strong of a wording for this exact situation but here is a more reasonable explanation: game is procedurally generated like 80-90% of it.

But in all seriousness I think it is also very dependent on what the product contains. If oculus offers a Headset, IR Camera and XB One controller for $300-$350 it easily justifiable to put a price tag of $500-$600 for HMD + Two Motion Controllers + Two Base stations in Vive's case. This also gets affected by launch titles, very heavily. 

$400 for limitied edition EVE CV1 + game - yes please

Also think about the following. If Valve actually release every copy of the Vive with a copy of Portal 3 or Half Life 3 that is a VR exclusive there's enough incentive for a lot of people to pay an arm and a leg for it. 

Oh and here's another factor to add to the madness:

Up until today HTC had the ""first to the market"" advantage card, but they've renounced it. This is an extremely good oportunity for Oculus because if they even just put up a preorder page during the Oculus Connect event, the majority of /r/Oculus will be hitting the preorder button like crazy since it is expected that the CV1 will be cheaper than the Vive. So that's going to eat up a little into Vive's sales which may affect their pricing.

- The controller is connected by cable

If they are building the game in like Unreal engine 4 or unity 5 or cry engine controller support is pretty much built in.

2416,"I think Valve/HTC might try to reduce the minimum requirements ever so slightly to compete with Oculus. For simple VR games even a 970 can be a bit of an overkill. I currently have a Gigabyte 970 G1 and was able with some tweaking to make Elite:Dangerous render at 4K then downscale it to 1080p@75hz running the game a Medium settings. 

Yes I had to do some tweaking in the Nvidia control panel as opposed to the game itself but my point is I could push the 970 to a resolution much higher than needed and still get good performance in game so the potential for a 960/770 being the minimum requirement is there.

That being said, you ain't gonna be doing no VR on a 13"" Macbook. You'd be hard-pressed to get a propper experience on MBP with dedicated graphics (considering it's going to need to push out slightly more than 1080p @ 90fps). The most expensive MBP right now has a AMD Radeon R9 M370X with 2GB GDDR5 memory which is not even as good as a desktop GTX660.

Sorry to say but you're going to need a desktop for this. Laptop just won't cut it :(",2015-08-12 11:26:52+00:00,cu0936t,2.0,t1_cu07l3v,5875.0,virtualreality

2418,"There's no easy way to deal with the cable twisting unfortunately. The way you normally would handle is to make two circular rings on top of each other and have a ball baring connecting the two so that when you spin, the current is transmitted from one ring, through the ball baring onto the other ring. The problem is there are a great number of cables involved (HDMI has quite a few, USB has quite a few) so building the thing as an amateur DIYer is quite the challenge. 

The obvious second solution is to go wireless. [There are HDMI transmitter receivers but expensiveeeee](http://www.theofficesuppliessupermarket.com/p/optoma-wireless-hdmi-system-20m-radius-ref-whd200-122597?gclid=Cj0KEQjwuqauBRDhnfvnxMvKy6UBEiQAmTLQu7SRi9Kf3FkSdYeayWiJityObzDymJ7xyC-IHUTICmsaAlyT8P8HAQ).

[Here you can see him playing with his hands obssesively](https://youtu.be/VIbh_HZJ3tM?t=3m50s), strong indicator that he is in need of comfort. His posture is not relaxed at all in general.

Also the most interesting tell is [here when Laura touches Ian](https://youtu.be/VIbh_HZJ3tM?t=4m7s). Both his legs and arms clench and tighten around his body, his upper body becomes rigid and stiff.

2473,"I've been dying to share this storry for the past couple of weeks!

I was looking with my SO through CVs a while back, she had to interview a few people for a QA position and never done it before so she wanted help.

So the role is a QA engineer, the pay is between 35-45k sterling, depending on experience and other factors. We had 10 candidates, all undergrads, 7 of them had masters and 1 even had a PHD.

I'll start off by saying that anyone that didn't have at least an undergrad in something would have not been considered unless some very exceptional circumstances were made and I'll explain why. An undergrad that was achieved with a relatively good grade will give me the security that your mind is able to adapt and aquire new information, whcih is an important ability in any job, so without that I don't know if you posses this ability even at the most basic level so I can't consider you for almost any position.

However, this is when things start to change: 7 masters degree? If there were only 2 people in there that had a masters that would have given them a great advantage however this is no longer the case as it is no longer a scarce advantage to have. So I'm looking at the undergrads and each of them had 2-3 years experience in something, be it dev, qa, design or even unrelated things like retail but it was SOMETHING. Then I'm looking at these masters guys, 5 of them no experience what so ever, why? Because the wouldn' have had time to work. To achieve A masters implies at least 4 years of higher education (undergrad+grad) if that's the only thing you were doing. But most people have other things to do as well, living and relaxing being two of them.

One of the masters guys had 2 years experience in php dev which was ok, but not what we wanted. The guy with a PHD had no work experience what so ever and the PHD actually prooved to be his downfall. I was easily able to google his name and find the paper he wrote. It was so poorly written and in such broken English that I couldn't go past the first page before deciding to give up because it was a wast of time. 

So the fight ended up between the 3 undergrads and the php dev. The position was offerd to one of the undergrads. That particular individual knew what he was talking about and while he wasn't as knowladgable he prooved to be a lot more flexible and versatile than the rest of them. The masters however... very arrogant, know-it-all and when he wouldn't know something and you'd tell them the answer he'd say ""OH you mean THAT, yeah I knew that it just skipped my mind"". Your mind can't possibly skip 9 out of 22 questions, one of them being ""Name 3 Automated Testing tools"" and he had on his CV: Basic experience with Selenium (which is an automated testing tool). 

And for any future employees out there reading this. Studies are important, and will help out, but they can also be your downfall. You need to think what wil help you most in the job you want to do! If you want to be a Software Architec a masters is pretty good to have but you're going to need at least 3 years experience as a regular dev as well, otherwise your cv goes straight in the shredder. Want to be an IT Support Specialist / Infrastrucure Specialist / DB Admin ? FUCK the Master's, what you need are certifications in these technologies. Just go do the courses and take exams you're wasting your time.

And my best advice. You could earn to go into a position that would normally require a masters without necesairly having one if you have enough experience behind you, however the reverse doesn't apply. ",2015-07-31 12:58:26+00:00,ctmpx7s,2.0,t1_ctm9j11,42179.0,AskReddit

Now your arguments above are all very true, especially the one about companies trying to choke the marking and locking it down into their platform. That's what companies do, it's a proven way to increase your business, generate revenue and expand quicker.

Linux is not developed by a company, so these tactics and ""features"" don't apply. I love Linux, I run it on my microserver, it's freaking awesome. I want to update everything? ""apt-get update"" ""apt-get upgrade"". I want to updates more granularity? Sure I can do that no problem. I CAN, You CAN, and not much of everyone else can.

With great diversity and great customization comes increased difficulty and reduced usability which guess what, is bad for business. It's unreal to expect from a company that has a sole purpose to increase the little number displayed in their bank account to do things that are not completely in their favor.

If Microsoft stops doing this, what happens? Mac gets more popular because it's ""easy"" although extremely fucking frustrating to use. If the OS sucks for you that's fine, I'm not overly happy about always on updates either and that will probably force me to adopt Ubuntu or Arch as a main OS and only use windows for gaming, but its restriction on features is not what makes it suck, it's the people who demand these restrictions and this bloatware that make it suck: Your Pesant friends, my peasant mom, the hipster in the coffee shop, that stupid friend in your facebook list that has a motivational fitness text as her profile picture, they are at fault for windows being the way it is.

So yeah, you said your opinion, congrats, but what is it going to change? At least if you weren't so hostile about it and expanded on it some people, like myself, would have agreed with you. But by being hostile and restrictive in your words, you got downvoted as nobody cared.

You're not dead - yeah great I'm paralyzed but not dead thanks - no seriously you're not dead and it's a really good thing and here's why:

1. You can obviously still use a computer so you are able to type, thanks to the IT/Computer industry you can still do plenty of jobs that don't require your lower body to fulfill. Yes they will be harder to obtain but not impossible, not even improbable for that matter and it is important that you can make money for the next points.

2. Virtual reality is around the corner. You will not miss out on that, you are still around to pretty much fully experience this new media form. It will be the norm in 5 years and it will be much better than it is now and you have all of those awesome experiences to look forward to.

3. [Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) are getting a lot better. This means that you along with everyone else who's living in these times will experience the power of controlling a computer with your mind. This is important for the development of point 4

4. Mechanical limbs are coming in a big way, check out [Bebionic](http://bebionic.com/). This is not something that will be available in 2025, this shit is available RIGHT FUCKING NOW. The promise for exoskeletons in the future that will be mind controlled though BCIs is very real. 

Again I'm really sorry for what happened. It sucks and it was a mistake and if it was 1950 it would have been a much worse situation but you along with everyone else here are going to live through some amazing human times. Mark my words by 2035 we will be living within Deus Ex Human Revolution.

If you have a static IP address then if someone figures it out they can abuse your network to do a spam of magic packets and turn on every device that will listen to those in your house.

If you don't have DDNS then you'll never know to which IP address to send the magic packet to, as your ISP might have changed yours since you left your house.

What I did was I created a website with username and password that I host on my Micro server at home. That's the only thing I allow to go into my network from the outside (HTTP requests on port 80)Then when I access a link on the micro server that in turn sends the magic packet to my computer so everything is happening within my home network.

2532,"Hi Dude, OP here!

Look I don't want to let you get downvoted into oblivion for posting a legitimate concern and frustration. I get it, i really do, you are no longer happy with the quality of the posts on this subreddit. They are repetitive, not all that funny, and don't move the conversation any further. Assholes like myself are posting pictures of their new $1 mouse pad, or some bad joke, or a post like this one, and I'm sorry for offending you :(

You see, it's the curse of popularity. The more popular something is, the more people it attracts. The more people it attracts, the lower the average intelligence of the community becomes, because there are more people that push the average into the average intelligence level of the whole human species. It is basically what happened to /r/funny and /r/askreddit.

I posted this, I didn't expect it to get so popular. I needed to blow off some steam because this scenario legitimately happened and I had nobody to share with that would understand and relate. I didn't intend for it to reach fron page or PCMR but it did.

If you want legitimately intelligent conversations, may I point you to /r/pcgaming or /r/games? Alternatively you can use the filters at the top of the page to avoid peasantry posts like this one.

I admire your call to change the sub for the better, and that's very noble, but that also requires having the individuals to change it with, and that's difficult because most people on here want to see more of the same, otherwise they wouldn't be here anymore.

Try and find your peace brother, find the community you need, as changing one is usually futile. May your temperatures be low and your frame rates high brother!",2015-07-08 21:15:10+00:00,cswnpik,2.0,t1_cswakpc,19028.0,pcmasterrace

1. If she does reject you in a demeaning manor and doesn't make a scene, the immediate next thing you're going to want to do is be mean back. You don't feel like it now but trust me, once you spit your feeling out if she's a bitch and tramples all over them you will be angry, so if she's rood about it make sure you say this loud enough for others to hear ""NO! I don't want that from you! I don't even have any money!"" and walk away.

2. If she does make a scene say this (replace with familiar names) ""SO you did it for Brad, Joey, Carlos, Mike and Nigel, some of them two at once, but all of a sudden my money's not good enough.""

I also wouldn't kick gaming to the curb that fast. A work friend of mine was developing a sort of VR Kart racing game for the Gear VR.

2604,"According to [this](http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/gearvr/gearvr_specs.html) the Gear VR has the following sensors in it:
Accelerator, Gyrometer, Geomagnetic, Proximity

Making abstraction of the proximity sensor which is just used to see if your face is in the Gear or not in order to turn on the headset, the other 3 are what give the rotation of the head. These sensors are in most smartphones anyway but in the Gear VR they have two major benefits: 

- 1 they are very low latency. According to the Gear VR page I linked earlier it takes under 20 ms from movement to photon (AKA it take 20ms beteween you moving your head and seeing the effect on screen). This means that the sensors are taking at least 50 readings a second (Aka 50Hz) but I'm sure it's much higher than that because you have to account for the delay added by the processor in the phone that needs to interpret the received data. 

- They are higher accuracy than the regular phone sensors. The sensors in your run of the mill smartphone don't need to be supper accurate for your basic flip over to silence or tilt your phone to drive the car games but in VR where every little nudge of your noggin is extremely noticeable you're going to want higher accuracy sensors. There's also the space factor, usually when you have more space to work with you can make higher accuracy sensors and since the Gear VR provides plenty of that (unlike a smartphone) you have the freedom of incorporating better inputs.

In the Gear VR they connect via USB to the phone and presto you're ready to go. Could this work on other smartphones as well? In theory yes. Does Samsung want that? Hell no, it's about them moneyz.

However it can't compete with the Gear VR in quality. Gear VR has extra and more precise sensors in it that allow it to keep accurate rotation correction. In it of itself the Gear VR is a far superior device, however most people don't feel comfortable shelling out close to 1k for the experience (Phone + headset) and as these precision sensors make their way into regular mobile phones the Gear runs the risk of becoming redundant.

As for the lenses on the XG VR, cannot complain one bit. They are supper quality on my LG G3.",2015-06-30 09:57:12+00:00,csndvkf,2.0,t1_csndq8d,653.0,oculus

I will be using it at more of an enthusiast level than a regular consumer level so I don't really care how ugly it is, i'm more interested in how functional it is.

If you're really interested in consumer quality, defiantely hold out for the Gen 2 gear VR. Supposedly the Note 5 is going to have a 4K screen and it makes no sense to put such a high rez display in a phone unless you want to use it for VR as well. 770dpi? I don't think you'll be able to distinguish the pixels on such a display even with a regular magnifying glass. 

I'm really excited for the Gen 2 Gear VR and will probably get it if the phone indeed has a 4K display. ",2015-06-30 08:35:34+00:00,csncrbz,4.0,t1_csncoqe,299.0,virtualreality
2610,"That's fine it's a legitimate question.

This is the first (to the best of my knowledge) truly universal quality phone VR headset. You have the google cardboard which is cool but really more of a gimmick than a HMD. There's the Gear VR that's really awesome but only works with one phone and then there's the Zeiss VR One which supports multiple phones but not all phones (you have to have a sort of plastic mold made for your phone to keep it in the correct position).

This is cheaper than the Zeiss VR (~$70 as opposed to 129 euros ($144)), fits all phones up to the nexus 6, is really comfortable and although you can't see it, the front is semi-transparent to allow pass through from the phone's camera. It also comes with a nice case.

Yes it is limited by how good the sensors on the phones are but then again you can use it with pretty much any phone. If you're interested in just a personal cinema experience that's comfortable or a demo unit to show off VR to friends and family this is a really good tool. I think it also fits glasses (can't say for sure i didn't try it with glasses on) and it has swapable face foams.

Hope that pretty much explains it. Feel free to ask away if you need more info.",2015-06-30 08:25:09+00:00,csncluw,2.0,t1_csnch02,538.0,virtualreality
