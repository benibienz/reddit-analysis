I basically [made this](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q71Pv). Ugly as all hell, I know, but the reason I made it is because it acts more like a fuel tank than a daily caloric tracker.

Let me explain. I wanted an app in which I put in how much I ate (say 500 calories) or how much I exercised (say -300) and it basically ads those calories to a fuel tank, that gradually gets emptier as time passes based on my BMI and the deficit I'm looking to achieve (say 1000 calories per day deficit). 

I'm not usually able to stick religiously to daily caloric needs. For example sometimes I would overeat, sometimes I'd forget to eat and normal calorie tracking apps (like MFP for example) mostly keep track of calories on a daily basis. For example if today I decide to eat 3000 calories, that's fine tomorrow is another day and I don't even see my past mistake. 

With this thing I made my mistakes follow me for a bit and I can correct them to get back on track by eating a little less each day.

Same goes for exercise, say today I've been especially good, ate within my calorie limit but also decided to go on a 2 hour bike ride, which in my case is about a 700 caloric burn. I add that in and it drops my fuel consumption through the floor so I can have some empty space saved up for the next ""cheat day"".

Is anyone else interested in such an app? Should I bother making it a bit more user friendly and hiking it up on the play store for free?",loseit,I made a calorie counter for myself that shows me food as I'm burning it and wanted to see if anyone else would be interested in it,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/50unx0/i_made_a_calorie_counter_for_myself_that_shows_me/

I finialy managed to get through all the sectors, reach and kill the final boss ""DAFOE"" (how very phunny RockFish). This game deserves a solid 5/7. 

Mechanically it is strong. The combat feels fun and engaging, the weapons are divers and entertaining to use. All it's missing is some context for why you're doing all of this.

The final boss is a bit of a wimp but considering he looks like your standard Terran fighter I expect him to be just a place-holder. Maybe there will be multiple end bosses as you progress through the game? (After all it is a Rogue-like). 

Can't wait for the final release.

Took me 20 hours to reach and beat this boss (For all i know it may just be the first boss), and I've killed about 20 pilots in the process.

We are trying to help our friend out and so far we've managed to start taking back control of their facebook account (we've removed apps until it stopped spamming out messages and we are now able to send messages and make posts again). 

We have also contacted TinyUrl a few seconds ago to ask them to kindly kill the URL to try and minimize the impact this message makes when its being sent from other computers. Haven't received a reply yet. 

We're currently trying to get our friend to install team viewer to try and log into their machine and see what damage that chrome plugin has done and remove it.

Is there anything else we can / should be doing? Anyone we can inform about this malware? A google search did not show any results for the specific url so I'm guessing it's something relatively new.

Not too long ago I made an Android game called [Super Stacker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TaranasusStudio.SuperCubeStacker) that started off as a selfish act of self-entertainment as I was fed up with all the ads and microtransactions in every other mobile game. After some thought I decided that it's better if I post it on the Play Store, for free with no ads or in-app purchases so that a lot more people can enjoy simple, interuption-free gaming.

Unexpectedly, my girlfriend's sister who's also a parent, messaged me this morning to thank me for making the app, as she can give it to her son to play and provide him with entertainment while in the car. Since there are no payments involved or ads, there are no risks of him being exposed to any unwanted activities or websites that may be detrimental to his development at this stage. 

There may be other parents in search for ways to help our their little ones not get bored on long road trips, or while waiting at the doctor's office, etc. so I figured I share the app here as maybe it will help out. 

It didn't cross my mind at first, but the app is very colorful and simple to understand. All you have to do is tap the screen when the cube flashes to drop it onto the spinning platform and create as high a tower as possible to get a higher score. 

Fell free to contact me with any questions, suggestions or requests that you may have an I'll do my best to answer them.

Hello! I'm a dev that gets bored extremely quickly, so I set out a little bit ago to make myself a game that I could play in short bursts of 2 - 10 minutes while I wait for my girlfriend to get ready, or waiting for my GP appointment, or while on the bus, you get the idea...

Why did I make my own game? Because every damn game on the android store is either riddled with microtransactions, or ads, or hell even both! I wanted something simple, like flappy birds was, that I can play for a quick minute without being force-fed 10 different brands of cleaning products.

Anyway, I made this game that's basically a spinning base and you have to drop cubes on, and the more cubes you release the faster it spins. Over time the tower of cubes grows and grows, while the cubes get smaller which increases the difficulty even more. It was fun for a while but once you get to a certain point, just beating your own high score is not that interesting anymore and I got bored.

So I though to myself, surely I'm not the only one that wants a quick game that doesn't put ads right where the trigger button is -.- I got to work on giving it some polish, making it all user-friendly and stuff, added google play leaderboards and hiked it up [on the play store today.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TaranasusStudio.SuperCubeStacker)

So who wants to compete with me in some tower stacking? I'm user SuperNasus on the leaderboard :D Come at me!

P.S. Oh yeah, the game is completely free, has no ads, no microtransactions, no annoying pup-ups begging for reviews. The game is and forever will be free. If at some point it becomes not free it means that Disney bought the rights to it and you will see a Disney Stacker soon after that.

I'm taranasus from Taranasus Studio and today we've launched our first ever mobile game: [Super Stacker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TaranasusStudio.SuperCubeStacker). The title is currently Android only as we don't have a iPhone developer license.

The game is about (hold on to your pants) stacking. You have a spinning base that constantly increases in speed and you have to stack blocks on top of each-other, aligning them perfectly, otherwise you'll slowly be destroying the tower's integrity.

I did this project all in my spare time for fun and I've mostly made it for myself to play while on the tube, or on the train, waiting for the misses to get ready in the morning, etc. I hope that you'll find it interesting enough to give it a shot and join me in competing for the leaderboards :P

Also the game is free, has no ads, and has no microtransactions. It was made purely so that I can have some fun while bored, but since others may be in my situation I though I'd share the love :)

I hope you like it, and if you do please leave a review and share it with your friends.

Doing the port was... interesting... and challenging.

The biggest problem faced is that you don't know if a specific issue is your code, the game engine code, driver code or the distro that you're running.

- Linux has no users because companies don't write software for linux because linux has no users because.... Yeah I want to help break that chain

- Steam OS, for all its faults, has some potential

Doing a Mac port at the same time because, honestly, they both use OpenGL so I figured kill two birds with one stone. I'm using Unity, this is important.

So did the Mac build first because less chances of something breaking due to os fragmentation. Worked no problem first try, I was feeling confident :D

Moved over to Linux, try and run it: Aborted (Core Dumped)... Awfully helpful, thanks! 

So start scouring the internet on how to enabled debugging, searching for the error message, searching for more specific error messages from the crash log. It seemed that for every error there could be 3-4 root causes so that wasn't really very helpful. 

Made a new empty project, compile for linux, copy acorss, worked fine...

Get more and more frustrated, finally decide ""OK, let's take the brute-force approach and just disable all the options and turn them on one by one to see what breaks, considering that the empty project works"".

After about 2 hours of testing, it ended up being (Drumroll): Stereoscopic rendering. That's strange, that's an option used mainly for VR (I have it enabled due to oculus support in windows) that shouldn't affect linux at all. At least I have something to goolge now.

Put that in google,[ first fucking result:](http://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.3.4p2)

(784075) - Linux: Fixed a crash when stereoscopic mode is requested on non-stereoscopic display.

I was running 5.3.4p1, P2 came out 11 days ago and I wasn't aware of it... WHOOP WHOOP!

In any case, download P2, compile it, HEELLLLOOO works just fine. So yeah, Linux support is coming :D

EDIT:

The fun never stops when being a gamedev... there are 5-6 new entries in my used DB today under the name of SKIDROW with fake Steam IDs. Joke's on them, the back-end does its own validity check.

To bring the title to gog they have to accept me. I've submitted an application and further down the list user /u/Fiishbait created [this little entry](https://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/void_21). If you would like to see my game on gog, I'm sure this would help a lot and I'd be really grateful as well as selling through GOG puts a bit of a spanner in the steam monopoly side of things.

We've just launched our first title [VOID 21](http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550) with VR Support. So far we could include Oculus 1.3 and we want to add Steam VR support as soon as we can get a hold of an HTC Vive. 

We realize this isn't something that fully exploits the possibilities of VR and we hope to make our next title even more VR-targeted, but we wanted to have a way to show how it would feel like going down a road at break-neck speeds without putting one in harm's way (since not everyone can afford a buggati, and driving one is quite dangerous). 

There is a free demo that fully supports VR as well should anyone want to try it out.

Hello to all the Oculus fans out there!

I just wanted to make a quick announcement that my game which I've been working on, [Void 21](http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550), has finally been released today on Steam with full Oculus DK2 and CV1 support using the new 1.3 Runtime. 

If it looks like your cup of tea, I'd encourage you to try out the demo which supports the oculus in the same way and hopefully you'll like it enough to want more. 

One word of warning, will most probably cause motion sickness to those susceptible to it since it is a very high speed game.

And finally, I'd like to make a quick **giveaway** to a few lucky readers of this subreddit. Just comment with a number between 0 and 9999 on the thread and I'll pick 7 winners at 20:00 GMT+1 (19:00 UTC) and then PM you with a steam key. 

Good luck!

Hello PC Gaming,

Void 21 is a fast paced runn… ahhhh screw self promotion that’s not even the main reason I’m here. I want to show my gratitude to this community and moderators (**Especially /u/code-sloth**). You all have been amazingly supportive towards me and my first game ever.

A bit of back-story: I’ve been a PC gamer ever since I was 3 years old. My Dad, another PC nut, showed me the ropes waaay back in the days of the Intel 80386 with awesome games like Asteroids, Aladin, Prince of Persia and gaming has been the biggest part of my life as far back as I can remember. 

I always wanted to make my own games, but I wanted them to be MY games. Not writing code for EA or Ubisoft, not being a little cog in a giant machine driven by marketing and PR. I wanted to have my own creations and for the better part of my life I wasn’t able to do that because, frankly I’ve never had the opportunity and financial backing to do so. 

I refused to make promises I couldn’t guarantee I can keep on other people’s hard earned cash. I refused to publish an unfinished game that people would throw money at in the hopes that it will turn out good in the end and It took close to 25 years on this planet to raise the funding on my own merit to follow this dream. 

But now, almost 26 years later I’ve managed to do that! It’s braught me [on the brink of bankruptcy](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/4c1rrp/after_months_of_development_and_with_my_life/) and if it fails it will have been a stupid idea and I will have not regretted it a single second. Why? Because it was what I wanted to do, and I have to thank you all for supporting me in this journey.

You all gave me the motivation I needed to keep going, and the reassurance that what I’m doing stands a chance. The amount of positive feedback I’ve received from PCGaming has been overwhelming and today, my first creation is out in the wild and it’s all thanks to you. Your encouragement and kind words made me happy and confident and I really don’t have the words to express my gratitude.

This giveaway does not make up for all of the awesomeness and kindness this subreddit has shown but I hope it’s a start. And with hope and a bit of luck, I will be successful enough to continue making new and better games going forward so that I may share them with you all and so that we can all enjoy the incredible gift that is PC Gaming.

**Thank you /r/pcgaming,**

Hello Brothers! 

Chances are you’ve seen one of my posts before but this will be my last related to the game I’ve made. This is a post to express my deepest thanks to all of you that have supported, encouraged and critiqued my work throughout the past few months. [From the early feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3ws6ud/working_on_a_game_for_vr_and_wanted_to_share_this/), [to the final stages of development](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4c1qoj/after_months_of_development_and_almost_all_of_my/), you guys have been with me [every](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/43zthm/when_your_battlestation_is_both_your_work_pc_and/) - [step](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/479o8w/am_i_doing_this_ascension_thing_right/) - [of the](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/48gj1x/the_creation_of_toasty_the_gaming_toaster/) - [way](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4blu2d/how_games_change_in_their_development_lifecycle/). [You suggestions have shaped the way the game evolved](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/43zthm/when_your_battlestation_is_both_your_work_pc_and/cznbbyq) which in turn makes it not only my creation, but the PCMR’s creation. Thanks to you all it’s much better of a title than I could have achieved on my own. 

As such, the video above is a thank you and this game is a dedication to the PC Master Race! It supports every aspect ratio from 4:3 to 21:9, all resolutions that your graphics card can handle, and frame rates high enough for every monitor out there. FOV goes from 50 to 110, gui is scalable, and even the in-game physics simulation can be tweaked to run faster or slower to suit your CPU’s power. This game can run on a toaster for heaven’s sake AND is DRM free (even on steam, feel free to just copy the files out of the common folder, it’s probably on a torrent site by the time you’re reading this anyway). In my opinion it’s truely a title worthy of the Master Race!

Also a special shout-out to the mods who not only are doing a stellar job at keeping this subreddit and all of its other social media accounts (twitter, steam, etc) in check, but are continuously spreading the word of the Master Race outside of our little closed ecosystem to those who are willing to lend their ear.

**In closing, Thank you brothers! You all have been amazing and I hope this community lives forever.**

Best Wishes,

Kaizen Taranasus

Hello esteemed letsplayeers,

My name is Taranasus and I am the developer of an upcoming game called [Void 21](http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550/), soon to release on the 4th of April. One of your members, /u/flakmaster92 pointed me your way saying that maybe some of you would be interested in doing a let's play of my game. 

If that is indeed the case and you are interested, [here are 10 steam keys](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B42WL2AzAp-4T1dzeEhsdGNvVmM/view?usp=sharing) for the closed beta so you have the game immediately available. There is no embargo so if you wish to do a let's play and die repeatedly in my deviously designed traps and obstacles, feel free to upload at any time you find best. My only requests are:

1. Please at least have a look at the steam page before claiming a key to make sure it is something you might like to play and cover.

2. Tweet me @taranasusstudio if you do release a video so I can enjoy it as well. 

And that's it really, hope you enjoy the game!

@Mods: I've checked the subreddit rules and I don't think I'm breaking any, but if I am let me know please :)

Maybe I missed the article, or I can't find it, but does anyone know when the support for Steam VR is going to be added? I also do not want to implement Steam VR into the game manually if it's going to be a native feature in the future since it would bloat up the game for little to no reason.

I’m close to releasing my first ever game, but that’s not why I’m here today. Nonono, i’m here because I’ve put together a video showing how games actually change throughout the development process and how they can actually go from looking pretty low effort to polished over a period of time. Since there may be aspiring game devs amongst you that feel intimidated by the looks of polished games these days (as I was once) this will hopefully put some of your fears to rest.

[Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxp6-GSX43M)

There are three things I’ve learned from this process that I’d like to share with you today in the hopes that it may help you going further:

1. Games can change, A LOT, throughout their dev cycle, both visually and mechanically. Mine is probably not the best example of this but [here is what Half Life looked like during development](http://cheerfulghost.com/Travis/posts/892/a-piece-of-history-resurfaces-half-life-alpha), and here is [Borderlands before they decided to go with cell-shaded graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuINXE5vJIY). As you can see, they look quite different from their released versions. Don’t be afraid to change your vision mid-way through dev, instead try to let yourself be lead by the change. Most times it will lead you to bigger and better things.

2. Take backups! Be it version control systems or just regular copy-paste, or even writing the code on napkins (please don’t do this), have redundancy! You should know better than anyone that hard drives fail, code gets corrupted, coffee gets spilled by accident. HAVE A BACKUP! And even if nothing bad ever happens, then you can go back and look at your work and see how far you’ve come, it’s an amazing feeling!

3. Don’t try to make your first game, your ultimate game. Your first title should be something cool, but not your holy grail idea (if you have one, it’s fine not to). The reason behind this is because you are currently an inexperienced amatur at best. Do not entrust your best idea to a noob, even if that noob is you, because it will have flaws, it will have problems and everything you make after your first game will be better in some way. Keep your best idea for last, let yourself grow, and once you have some years of experience behind you, jump in head first!

For everyone else, I hope this was a fun read and brings a little insight in the game dev world. I posted this here as well and not on gamedev communities only because most aspiring devs are not on those communities yet, and it may be entertaining to watch/read for everyone else as well (I hope).

I'm close to releasing my first game, but that's not why I'm here today. I wanted to share with you a video I made that shows my game and its aesthetics from day one all the way to release.

[Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxp6-GSX43M)

The reason I want to share is two-fold:

1. It shows off really really well how drastically a game can/may change during its development lifecycle. For a first title, I've learned about an interesting trap I kept falling in: At every stage I thought my creation looks amazing, but looking back at it now, I think that in the beginning I wasn't right in the head. Which means that maybe it doesn't look its best now either. Moral of the story: GET FRESH EYES ON IT AND LISTEN TO FEEDBACK. It hurts, it stings, it punches you in the face, embrace it! You don't necessarily have to follow it, some of it will most definitely be bad but ask for it and listen to it, it's really important as you are very biased most of the time towards your baby.  

2. Take backups! This video was possible due to regular backups I would take of the code. I've worked as a support engineer before, and let me tell you hard drives fail, A LOT. Do you want to loose months of work because you couldn't be bothered to spend 10 minutes and maybe $60 on a portable hard drive or something to keep a backup? (Not that I'm recommending having just a portable hard drive, but it's a start...) I've had to rely on my backup twice! Once because a Unity upgrade went horribly wrong and the other time because viruses and both times it only set me back by a few hours to a day. I cannot overstate this: TAKE REGULAR BACKUPS.

Hope you like the video and find my advice useful.

Edit: I see this is confusing the more nitpicky users of reddit so I'd like to make a clarification. By Backup I mean any means by which you won't lose your work in the even of a personal hardware failure. I don't care which method you use be it cassettes, cloud storage, Github, SVN, printing your code files on paper, whatever just make sure your code is not just all sitting in one place ready to be lost.",gamedev,"To all aspiring gamedevs, this is how a game looks at different stages in its development",https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4bhssy/to_all_aspiring_gamedevs_this_is_how_a_game_looks/

If I feel any sort of discomfort (sadness, boredom, stress, panic, loneliness, etc) I am stuffing my face with sugar faster than a lightning bolt generated by a tesla coil.

And this has been the case until yesterday morning. Yesterday morning after reading up a little online and having a thought about it I found a good way of controlling myself. No diet (just calorie counting), no fuss, not banning off sweets, the only thing I do is when I get a need to eat I just wedge in there the question ""why are you eating?"" and start contemplating it: 

- Because I'm bored - Let's play a videogame then, food's not the answer to that
- Because I'm tired - Well that's fixed by sleep not eating silly, common to bed
- Because I'm thirsty - water it is then
- Because I have a craving - Okay sure, that's fine, cravings are normal but whatever you were going to have, you're having just a little piece
- Because I'm hungry - Okay is it a scheduled meal time. Yes? Congrats, have a portion of 400-500 cals of food. Is it not meal time? Have a light 100 cal food snack to keep you going
- Because I'm sad - aww i'm really sorry but foods only going to make you feel better for 1 second and it's back to being sad. Need something else to fix that
- Because I'm stressed - Out of the kitchen and into the bathtub
- Because someone else is shoving it in my face - Ok taranasus, breathe in and breath out, it's not impolite to refuse and if you really want what they're offering, one piece only, the smallest one for taste, say thank you like a good little boy and carry on the conversation

You can see where this is going. The whole habit was really easy to pick up but since I'm doing it for the first time I don't really know what to expect as challenges:

- Will I forget about it in a weeks time and revert back to default?
- Will a strong enough eating emotion override it and make it null and void?
- Are there any risks to this long term? I.E. does it get tiring, does it get annoying, does it get stressful in it of itself?

I'm sure I'm not the first one to think of this but it seems to be doing wonders for me so I'm hoping there are other members on here doing the same thing and can advise me on the questions above as well as share any other pitfalls I haven't thought of. And for those that haven't thought of this, might be worth giving it a try?

Also if there are any materials around this idea written by medical professionals that you can share they would be very much appreciated. I've tried googling for this but the amount of backyard science around weight-loss is astonishing and so far I haven't found any sort of scientific explanation for this working well and how to optimize and automate the whole ""why are you eating process?"".

Thanks for taking the time to read this and let me/us (the community) know of your experience.",loseit,I wanted to bounce this idea off of you guys since you might already have tried it and can advise me going forward (Mindful eating).,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/4a75my/i_wanted_to_bounce_this_idea_off_of_you_guys/

If this post is inappropriate for the subreddit, just say so and I will go ahead and delete it, otherwise I need your help!

I'm Taranasus, creator of Taranasus Studio and Void 21 ""a procedurally generated, arcade style, fast-paced runner and shooter. You are a pilot training with the highly maneuverable and lethal Void ship. Your objective is to reach the end of the level, either as quickly or as violently as possible (or both?)""
 
I was hoping to bring your attention to my game in the hopes that you'll like it enough (or dislike it enough, although I'm very confident it won't be the case) to make a video on your respective channels about it. As a developer I'm just starting out and don't have any sort of community so every little helps. 

If you would be interested in trying out the game here you have:

- [A press kit (sort of)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jBwTHHDo_GXcNpl4bdcIkARyX8Ix0fZFhST0-ARisnI/edit?usp=sharing)
- [A gameplay video in 4K60fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSW6gJNfPQM)
- [And a YouTube thumbnail image, which has space at the bottom to insert your logo and other info](http://i.imgur.com/Y0mUWpc.png) You can of course make your own if you like.
- [A link to download the demo of the game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/444550). Now please don't run away after reading the word demo. The full game isn't completed yet and the demo provides for about 10 hours of gameplay (your millage may vary depending on skill) so it should give you a good idea of the core elements.

I will of course be happy to retweet any reviews that you guys put out to my very small community, be them positive or negative. 

If there is anything else that you need from me, I'm at your disposal.

I wrote the following article on my development blog, but in the interest of generating discussion and not self-promote, I will do a full paste of the text here and link to my post at the end if anyone is interested. 

&gt; **Are demos really worth it?**
&gt; 
&gt; On the 16th of February 2016 we released a demo for our title, in order to give everyone interested a chance to try out the mechanics and gameplay. With 30 different sections in the demo, and a difficulty progression path, we estimated this will provide for about 4 hours of gameplay.
&gt; 
&gt; We have had a few downloads since then, on the 21st of February reaching 500. This got us pretty excited as at least 500 people were curious enough to try out the title. Some even were kind enough to make youtube videos and twitch streams about it, both with very positive feedback and with fair criticism. Of course this gave us quite the confidence boost but 500 is not really a representative number. What does it mean compared to other demos? Compared to other titles and to full releases? And is there really any benefit to actually having a demo from a marketing perspective?
&gt; 
&gt; **Raw numbers:**
&gt; 
&gt; We can check the number of downloads we’ve had, however there is no way to retrieve the numbers for other titles. Steamspy offers no data on demos as far as we could tell, while SteamDB giving a little information, but not much. They show the number of players concurrently playing the game and keep track of these numbers on a graph… but that’s about it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our 24 hour peak, at the time of writing, is 5 concurrent players online, with an all time peak of 7. It’s not much, it’s barely any data to actually draw a bottom line. So we turned our attention to more popular games on steam that also offer demos: 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Title | 24H peak | All-time peak | Release Date
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Dying Light | 17,062 | 45,871 | 26 Jan, 2015
&gt; Dying Light Demo | 289 | 748|
&gt; Demo/Full Release|1.69%|1.63%|
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Castle Crashers|855|16,013|26 Sep, 2012
&gt; Castle Crashers Demo|11|84| 
&gt; Demo/Full Release|1.28%|0.52%|
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; The Stanley Parable|222|4,818|17 Oct, 2013
&gt; The Stanley Parable Demo|27|966 |
&gt; Demo/Full Release|12.16%|20.04%|
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; XCOM: Enemy Unknown|12,836|22,328|12 Oct, 2012
&gt; XCOM: Enemy Unknown Demo|20|59|
&gt; Demo/Full Release|0.15%|0.26% |
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Total War: SHOGUN 2|5,416|9,546|15 Mar, 2011
&gt; Total War: SHOGUN 2 DEMO|12|54 
&gt; Demo/Full Release|0.221%|0.565%
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Euro Truck Simulator 2|18,844|33,215|16 Jan, 2013
&gt; Euro Truck Simulator 2 Demo|338|433 
&gt; Demo/Full Release|1.79%|1.30%
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; American Truck Simulator|11,439|19,153|2 Feb, 2016
&gt; American Truck Simulator Demo|750|1,210| 
&gt; Demo/Full Release|6.55%|6.31%
&gt; 
&gt; These results were quite surprising. People don’t actually play demos, almost at all. Looking at the table above, The Stanley Parable is the only game that actually has some numbers to speak of, and that’s considering that their demo is a prequel to the full game itself with its own unique content, and not a section of the finished game. American truck simulator comes in second (I’m actually downloading the demo myself as I’m writing due to curiosity) but at most 6% of their player base actually tried the demo before buying the full product. If you take into account the fact that some people didn’t go on to buy the full game, that 6% is an improbable best-case scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is one thing to comment on the data above is that it doesn’t list any smaller games to show how they compare between demo and release. This is because the data sample is too small to actually draw a solid conclusion from it. Here are three very small and unknown indie titles and their numbers
&gt; 
&gt; Title|24H peak|All-time peak|Release Date
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Color Symphony 2|1|4|16 Oct, 2015
&gt; Color Symphony 2 Demo|2|4
&gt; Demo/Full Release|200%|100%
&gt; ---|---|----|----
&gt; Shift Happens|5|16|9 Sep, 2015
&gt; Shift Happens Demo|2|10|
&gt; Demo/Full Release|40%|62%
&gt; ---|---|----|---- 
&gt; Kick Ass Commandos|1|5|20 Jul, 2015
&gt; Kick Ass Commandos Demo|1|7
&gt; Demo/Full Release|100%|140%
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see, this is not really the best sample to be analyzing in terms of averages.
&gt; 
&gt; **How about the promotion value of it?**
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t believe we can give a definitive answer to this one, as we uploaded the demo straight away after opening the steam page, however it is worth noting that because we uploaded the demo, it was featured in Steam’s new releases section without the game actually being released. That brought quite a bit of traffic to the game’s page on steam, having 10,000 unique visitors in the last 5 days. It was displayed on the new releases first page for about 2 days until “Trainz Driver” released around 20-30 DLC packs which pushed it down significantly.
&gt; 
&gt; So in terms of promoting the game, it did have an affect, but in the grand scheme of things it was probably a very small one.
&gt; 
&gt; If you’re starting off, and this is your first game, it’s probably worth making a demo as it is cheap advertising (at least on steam) which will help with the creation of a small community. It also aids your reputation as a developer. If the gameplay in the demo is solid, it’s a fun experience and it doesn’t crash you’re already making a statement for the quality of your work which helps towards building that community you need.  However if you’re an already established developer/studio with two or three titles in your portfolio, making a demo may not be that profitable since, as the stats above show, barely anyone plays it compared to your fully released game. But hey if it’s not too much trouble to create, it doesn’t seem to hurt either.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope that brings some insight and helps you make good and informed decisions going into the future. We will now try and see if there are other platforms, like itch.io where we can release our demo and see if there’s any differance in traffic behavior and download count. Analyzing the data of only one distribution platform is not a very accurate representation of the whole industry, even if it is the biggest platform.

Because of rule #7 I'm not allowed to link directly to other subreddits but I think this is a worthwhile discussion to have within the masterrace since this is how we distinguish ourselves from mindless consumerism. Thus it's time to copy-pasta the whole thing and ask the mods for forgiveness as it is a matter that should be discussed within out community and brings light on why steam is so hard to get rid of:

 
&gt; **Introduction**
&gt; 
&gt; [removed who I am and what I do as this is not about self-promotion]. I wanted to share with you all my experience with game distribution platforms since it is something we all have to go through sooner or later. It's not really as much advice as it is a... kind of strange and silly story
&gt; 
&gt; **What happened**
&gt; 
&gt; We were trying to apply on multiple distribution platforms to obviously sell our game. Steam is of course a main contender but we're also avid supporters of no DRM, thus we wanted to sell through gog.com as well to give that option to the people who wanted it. So we looked into applying for both platforms and here  is our experience with both.
&gt; 
&gt; **GOG.COM**
&gt; 
&gt; We first applied to gog.com. They have this nice little [indie program](https://www.gog.com/indie) where they say they focus on communication and trying to help promote and better your game. As a first time Dev that of course sounded very enticing and the possibility of having some experienced people giving us advice on how to enhance our title was very appealing. I quote from their website
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;We're not machines. We talk. We are always ready to openly discuss your game and its perspectives on GOG.com. We carefully consider every single game. Learn more!
&gt; 
&gt; Cool! Sign us up! At the time we didn't really have a website or a very polished game since it was still mid development and those things weren't needed yet. I agree this was our mistake, but we did mention in the sign-up forms that we are more than happy to give early builds videos and so on upon request to show off more of the title, but they needed to be on request since their sing-up form didn't allow us to send information directly to them and we didn't want to disclose anything publicly at that time. Considering they promoted open communication, we didn't think this was a problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; So we signed up... and silence... for a long time...
&gt; 
&gt; **Steam Greenlight**
&gt; 
&gt; Time had past, quite a lot of it and the game was taking shape very nicely. We thought it was ready and had a standing chance in the community brawl that is Greenlight. Made the page, some videos, and released it into the wild. It was violent...
&gt; 
&gt; For the grenlight tax of £70 we received a crazy amount of attention in a very short time-span. Most of it positive, some of it constructive negative, and very little pointless negative. We were REALLY happy! We were in Greenlight for only 10 days, passing with just 633 yes votes, but this was a 53 to 45 yes/no ratio. For those £70 (that go to charity btw) we received the attention of 1836 individuals that are our targeted audience. THAT IS CHEAP MARKETING!
&gt; 
&gt; What was happening with GOG int he meanwhile? Total radio silence... not even a peep, or even a confirmation email that they received our submission. I opened a support ticket with them, as that was the only means of contact I could find, to ask for a confirmation of ""submission received"" and NOT a decision on the title. Someone got back to me a day later with request to be patient while they review my title... All I wanted was a confirmation, I wasn't trying to be pushy :(
&gt; 
&gt; **Steam Store**
&gt; 
&gt; So with Greenlight out of the way, I got comfortable setting up the store page and making a demo of the game so people can try it out. Although very limited exposure, for the little that we did have we've received really good reactions and are really happy with them. I'll link two videos made by the community [here - link removed to not self-promote] and [here- link removed to not self-promote] for the curios. 
&gt; 
&gt; **EGX Rezzed**
&gt; 
&gt; We were definitely pushing the right buttons as EGX Rezzed noticed us and asked if we wouldn't be interested to attend this year's event as developers and demo our game at a both. EGX Rezzed is kind of like PAX for Indie Games in the UK, not a huge event but big enough to catch the attention of press and have a few 1000 people attend. Obviously we were thrilled at the opportunity so we accepted, and they were even nice enough to write [an article about the game - link removed to not self-promote] to officially announce our attendance. By this point we are supper excited with all the attention that we're receiving.
&gt; 
&gt; **GOG.COM Return!**
&gt; 
&gt; This morning I finally received word from GOG that hey are turning us down... three weeks after the original submission. Remember that awesome communication, and feedback loop and advice from them? Yeah neither do we... I personally don't even know how to react, part of me wants to reply saying ""Thanks for judging us on what's now irrelevant information and for all that communication you promised"" but I think I'm just going to ignore it and move on. We had no way of contacting them after sending the original submission to provide more screenshots/videos/information, there was no contact from them at all, overall it feels like we weren't even given a chance to try and make a case. Just a flat out rejection.
&gt; 
&gt; **Conclusion**
&gt; 
&gt; I am not pleased with this for multiple reasons, the biggest because I feel like we've been lied to. It was not at all how [they advertised this whole thing would go down](http://www.gog.com/indie) and I personally feel that we weren't even given a fighting chance with them. 
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, we now have to find some other way of providing DRM-free copies. Maybe Desura or directly from our website? I don't know it's something we have to start looking into but now it's more work to try and figure this out... Perhaps the humble bundle store, they seem like nice people.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, this is why Steam is a gargantuan! They know what they are doing. They started out as an elitist store, selling only quality games and that worked for a while. When competition started popping up, as well as indie games becoming popular, they saw the potential for more revenue and lowered the brier of entry. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Did this allow for more pointless stuff on steam? Yes. 
&gt; - Did it cause some controversy? Yep
&gt; - Are they the biggest and most complete store because of that? Oh yeah
&gt; 
&gt; For all of its flaws, the Greenlight system succeeded in further expanding on their idea of providing a better delivery service for games than piracy. And for better or worse, the store still self-regulates to some extent, filtering out good content and allowing it to rise while pushing the bad one to the bottom. It's not ideal by any means, but it gives small times like us a small chance at success rather than no chance at all. 
&gt; 
&gt; Let me know what you guys think... maybe i'm just bitter and self deluding and am the only one with a bad experience... I dunno

Again, I can't link back to that thread, but I was surprised to find out that A LOT of devs have had the same exact experience with GOG... so we're all forced to rely on steam further to sell our stuff and thus the monopoly continues.

**EDIT - PHEW WHAT A DAY**

Hi everyone,

It's been a very insightful discussion and I'd like to thank all of for talking to me about it. It's given me great insight on my behavior and attitude towards the whole situation and I’d like to thank both those that supported me but especially those who criticized me.

And my conclusions are as follows: You’re right. I was arrogant and entitled, GOG don’t owe me anything and my game was nowhere near at the standards they uphold on their site, probably still won’t be for another while. This is by no means a defeat and I did overreact to their lack of communication. They probably don’t have the manpower to respond to every other crazy person like me to provide constructive feedback on their game, but I still wish they’d make an amendment to their page specifying this.

I’m going to continue working on my game and see where that takes me, so far it’s been quite an awesome ride and hopefully it will continue being like that going into the future.

Again, thank you all for taking the time and effort to talk to me about what I’ve written and my thoughts on the matter, it’s been a pleasure and extremely insightful! I wish you all success with whatever it is you do.

Hi everyone, I'm taranasus from Taranasus Studio, creator of [Void 21](http://void21.com/). I wanted to share with you all my experience with game distribution platforms since it is something we all have to go through sooner or later. It's not really as much advice as it is a... kind of strange and silly story

**What happened**

We were trying to apply on multiple distribution platforms to obviously sell our game. Steam is of course a main contender but we're also avid supporters of no DRM, thus we wanted to sell through gog.com as well to give that option to the people who wanted it. So we looked into applying for both platforms and here  is our experience with both.

**GOG.COM**

We first applied to gog.com. They have this nice little [indie program](https://www.gog.com/indie) where they say they focus on communication and trying to help promote and better your game. As a first time Dev that of course sounded very enticing and the possibility of having some experienced people giving us advice on how to enhance our title was very appealing. I quote from their website

&gt;We're not machines. We talk. We are always ready to openly discuss your game and its perspectives on GOG.com. We carefully consider every single game. Learn more!

Cool! Sign us up! At the time we didn't really have a website or a very polished game since it was still mid development and those things weren't needed yet. I agree this was our mistake, but we did mention in the sign-up forms that we are more than happy to give early builds videos and so on upon request to show off more of the title, but they needed to be on request since their sing-up form didn't allow us to send information directly to them and we didn't want to disclose anything publicly at that time. Considering they promoted open communication, we didn't think this was a problem. 

So we signed up... and silence... for a long time...

**Steam Greenlight**

Time had past, quite a lot of it and the game was taking shape very nicely. We thought it was ready and had a standing chance in the community brawl that is Greenlight. Made the page, some videos, and released it into the wild. It was violent...

For the grenlight tax of £70 we received a crazy amount of attention in a very short time-span. Most of it positive, some of it constructive negative, and very little pointless negative. We were REALLY happy! We were in Greenlight for only 10 days, passing with just 633 yes votes, but this was a 53 to 45 yes/no ratio. For those £70 (that go to charity btw) we received the attention of 1836 individuals that are our targeted audience. THAT IS CHEAP MARKETING!

What was happening with GOG int he meanwhile? Total radio silence... not even a peep, or even a confirmation email that they received our submission. I opened a support ticket with them, as that was the only means of contact I could find, to ask for a confirmation of ""submission received"" and NOT a decision on the title. Someone got back to me a day later with request to be patient while they review my title... All I wanted was a confirmation, I wasn't trying to be pushy :(

**Steam Store**

So with Greenlight out of the way, I got comfortable setting up the store page and making a demo of the game so people can try it out. Although very limited exposure, for the little that we did have we've received really good reactions and are really happy with them. I'll link two videos made by the community [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm9S4ob6QOc) and [here](http://www.twitch.tv/dominationagenda/v/47240892) for the curios. 

**EGX Rezzed**

We were definitely pushing the right buttons as EGX Rezzed noticed us and asked if we wouldn't be interested to attend this year's event as developers and demo our game at a both. EGX Rezzed is kind of like PAX for Indie Games in the UK, not a huge event but big enough to catch the attention of press and have a few 1000 people attend. Obviously we were thrilled at the opportunity so we accepted, and they were even nice enough to write [an article about the game](https://www.egx.net/rezzed/news/fast-paced-racer-void-21) to officially announce our attendance. By this point we are supper excited with all the attention that we're receiving.

**GOG.COM Return!**

This morning I finally received word from GOG that hey are turning us down... three weeks after the original submission. Remember that awesome communication, and feedback loop and advice from them? Yeah neither do we... I personally don't even know how to react, part of me wants to reply saying ""Thanks for judging us on what's now irrelevant information and for all that communication you promised"" but I think I'm just going to ignore it and move on.

It is thanks to this community that my dream of becoming a game dev is finally coming true! No more board meetings, no more nonsense, no more fucking ""employee retention plans"" or ""critical situation analysis"". Fuck that, that's in the past and it's all thanks to you!

[The demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUjMrw3sHaQ) for the game will be out on the 17th and as it stands, I guess you'll be able to download it through steam to try out :D.

In essence the article talks about what random and procedural generation are and gives examples of how each is achieved, then talks about the advantages and dissadvantages of each technique as well as touching on why AAA companies don't make use of it while indie devs make heavy use of it.

Finally the article ends with the mention that these two techniques shouldn't be used for all types of games and describes why.

CMDR Kaizen Taranasus here. As you may or may not know Amazon have a new service called Amazon Merch were you can make T-shirts and then buy them for yourself or sell them online.

I originally started out making just a t-shirt for myself, but then CMDR LegWarmers (Aka The Misses) really liked it and wanted one and after doing a give-away on PC Master Race I saw there was an interest for the shirts.

I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in it. [Here's a link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0161EUXIC)

I don't know any other way to promote these things and I really don't want to spam my Facebook and twitter feed constantly since most non-elite people won't get the reference anyway and will not care, so I rather show it to you lovely folk as you're the only ones who might give a damn.

Anyway, if you have any suggestions or critiques they are more than welcome as long as they are helpful and civil (i.e. ""It sucks""; while it does send a rather hurtful message it doesn't help me improve in any way).

Thank you for your time in reading this post. It's most appreciated :)

Hi everyone,

I've recently started making some t-shirts on Merch by Amazon since it allows for a very hassle-free way of making them. I began by creating them for myself and then my SO wanted one, so did a friend of mine, and then after posting a link on /r/Oculus I saw people showed some interest so I thought I’d maybe spread the word a little.

I love my brothers and sisters on PC Master Race. Most of you are actually very kind and helpful people with plenty of good will and a wish to aid the ones in need. As a community we've together conquered the unfair evil that was paid mods: a very good idea executed extremely poorly. Then we managed to promoted the idea that buggy games on release are not acceptable, and although we had to suffer without playing the latest Batman game, it has sent a clear message that we do not wish to purchase games in unplayable states (to be fair, the steam refunds could not have come at a better time). Finally, our most recent of victories showed that we are sick of pre-orders and don't want to accept that sort of practice anymore. Even though it was not a full victory, it did take down the craziness that was the ""Augment your pre-order"" campaign.

It is because of all of us that gaming on PC is returning to its former glory, and thus I want to give something back to the community. These shirts, as I've hinted, were never intended for profit, so I want to use the profit I did make thus far to organize a give-away here. 

I’ve actually raised enough money to give away 2 t-shirts. The rules are simple:

1. Reply on the thread telling me why do you want to win.

2. Pick the t-shirt you would like out of the 4 I’ve made 

[Auto Aim Off](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0160V5DH2)

[Best Gaming Input Device](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016132TDK)

3. You have to be a resident in one of the countries to which [Amazon.com ships](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201074230). If not I am sorry to say but you will be disqualified as there is no way for me to ship the prize over to you :(

I will pick two winners at 12 Eastern Time (16 UTC time). Once I have picked the winners I will PM you to ask for your shipping address and more details about your future t-shirt (basically size and gender).

It's got everything I wanted/needed and more! It's been a journey to get it up and running. I probably formatted it 20 times because I kept breaking it by trying things out impulsively but finally It's alive and it's just like a dream!

Setting everything up can sometimes be fidgety especially if you don't know what you're doing. But once you get the hang of it and everything is in it's place, you realize how powerful this OS is. My VPN connection is TWO CLICKS away in a very intuitive network menu. Click click connected done!

I could add gyazo into the top bar for quick screenshots and I can add it wherever I want on the bar! Not just as a ""pin to task bar"" but ANYWHERE. Before the clock, after the clock, in the middle of the start menu IT DOESN'T CARE!

I got to set up a cool functional semi-transparent terminal to have permanently on the screen. It even supports having multiple tabs of consoles. And then there's the compty system status indicator. OH HOW I LOVE THAT THING! It gives me so much useful information right on the screen.

All my apps are here, including YNAB which doesn't have Linux support. But who cares because WINE has become amazing!

Oh and best of all. Booting up my computer takes 3 seconds from when the POST ends to when the login screen is shown. There are many more things it does, it could fill a book!

So far I've managed to: Run Bioshock Infinite in 4k60fps on a GTX 970. The only compromise I had to make were the shadows and ambient oclusion. For some reason when I turn those on it halves my framerate. Otherwise everything is running solid

Setting up a VPN was just braindead simple. Seriously it's more of a hassle to do it in windiows. In here it seems like the network manager was built with VPN as its main purpose. OpenVPN? No problem. PPTP? No problemo. Once you've set it up just right click, connect, half a second later BOOM GOOD TO GO!

Everything is running supper smooth. I couldn't be happier! :)

EDIT 3: So I F-ed up the nvidia drivers the first time arround and kind of broke it. Feeling a little discuraged i slaped myself over the face with a slice of Domino's Mighty Meaty pizza and tried again. This time found some better tutorials on installing the drivers and everything and now it's a lot better! Big shout out to /u/cod3r__ for the suggestion on compton. It's so much better with it.

Problems I've run into so far: Second time arround installing Xubuntu it installed it as an UEFI booter without GRUB so my Bios was shouting ""MISSING OS"". A quick change in the bootloader fixed that.

Steam after installing was complaining about not beeing able to install ""Steam needs libgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386"". This fixes it: sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libgl1-mesa-dri-lts-utopic:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx-lts-utopic:i386

Hello brothers,

I AM SICK TO MY GUTS OF IT (Windows). Why am I even trying to justify it to myself? 

I get windows 10, Microsoft advertises it as a ""simple upgrade process"". Yeah, sure, once it decideds to actually start installing it's ""simple"". However to get the freaking upgrade to download propperly is a 3 hour long nightmare. I thought there was something wrong with my PC but I had the same exact bloody experience on my GF's machine.

I'm not new to Linux, I have a HP Gen7 microserver that runs #! and I couldn't be happier with it. The thing just goes. But back to my story.

So after FINALLY geting this piece of dog poop to install on both PC's I have to go through the ""Simple"" configuration menu which is the most deceiving pile of ars on the planet to get my account configured. It even has a button called ""Experet settings"" which makes you feel like a god for pressing but what it actually does is that it preconfigures everything for you so that your computer becomes a Microsoft SLAVE! ""Oh we'll just take all of your data, store it, process it, sell it a bit, and then just to make sure we'll use your PC as a WSUS server (Windows Server Update Service for those unfamiliar) so all the internets can download patches from your machine, as us hosting the servers is expensive AND we'll also give out your wifi password hasesh to whomever we feel like so they can connect to your wifi and use it without you knowing KTHXBYE!""

Want to not install security patch K232432423423 because it's a driver for a microsoft keyboard model that you don't even use? TOUGH TITS because if you're running home edition you can't even disable updates.

Time for a paradigm shift. If Linux runs like a rock on my microserver maybe it will run just as well on my desktop. I've tested out so far Mint, Ubuntu, Arch (holly moley I'm not ready for Arch yet), #! and Xubuntu and so far I'm kind of in love with xubuntu for it damn elegance and simplicity. 

I'm going to be scowering the interwbes another 30 minutes for other distros to see if anything catches my eye. If anyone has any other suggestions on what to try I'm all ears. I'm looking for something that can be customized and supports having eyecandy out its nose (I like mysels some pretty Desktop Environments) and that is easy to use.

Cheers brothers!

EDIT: ALSO! This fucking pisses me off to the extreme. I shouldn't have to fill up my hosts files with 26000 mappings to 0.0.0.0 in order to stop adds popping up in an OS THAT I FUCKING PAID £90 FOR! If any paid app on the Android or iOS store pulled this shit it would be rated 1 out 5 by everyone under the sun!",linuxmasterrace,"F**k it, f**k it with a shovel, let's do this thing...",http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/3fhucm/fk_it_fk_it_with_a_shovel_lets_do_this_thing/

Today someone in the support team said that Uncharted 4 could never run on a PC, it's way to smooth. My brain imploded.

A game developed, tested and DEMOED (because that's how all demos are showed at E3, PAX, EGX, etc) on a PC, could not run on a PC.

Presenting them with this information, they replied ""Yeah but it could never be as smooth on a PC"". 

I, ugh... my head... I think i need to claim the rest of the day as sick because of the migraine that gave me...",pcmasterrace,Uncharted 4 could not run on a PC,http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3cj5a3/uncharted_4_could_not_run_on_a_pc/
