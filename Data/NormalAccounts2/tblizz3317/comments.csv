FSU moves down the field mostly due to a large screen to Cook. A somewhat questionable pi call in the endzone (not really catchable but close enough for football standards) which led to a broken tackle run by Francois for the go ahead points. 

UNC makes a big play to get near midfield the next drive. A more questionable pi call against FSU (was contact while ball in air but from what I could see off of ESPN it was incidental) moves them to the 35. Walk off fg.

Liquor we tend to be the lowest in price with Normans right there with us. Price difference are just based off of case deals we get and what not. Total again will show up with prices we can't possibly match without losing money

First and foremost, just because they are black doesn't mean they automatically vote for the most progressive candidate. Thats basically an idea that gets pushed by media because of lazy reporting.

Disenfranchisement: the recent Black Lives Matter movement isn't bringing about any new information on how much of the black community feels about government and authority.
