He said that could mean that only 3100 got shipped to stores, and that doesn't count online, and the promo that funko did on their site for those limited locations. 

Or it could be 3100 pieces total.  Or it could just be a inventory tracker number.   He gives me what knowledge he has available to him.  Sometimes he has been right on, and other times not.

324,"I'm posting without reading all the others advice. I go about 5-6 times a week, after every workout that really gets my lactic acid pumping I will get on the rower and do a nice cool down row; damper at 3/4 (for a guy) and go for about 500-1000 meters (dictate on how you feel during the row, you want to bring yourself to a very calm state where you feel a bit refreshed; keep a slow pace, remember it's a cold down). That usually flushes the remainder of my lactic acid out of my system. 

After that it's just hydration with proper recovery and nutrition.  It's different with all athletes.  I give this advice not knowing your current fitness level, types of workout, equipment used, etc. but it's a pretty general way to read your body after a workout.

From what I have seen HT website does not do this.  I believe popcultcha website does do this.  I am assuming, I clicked on one that said ""1 Item Left"" and it was a rather popular one, and it sat in my shopping cart for about an hour as I kept browsing the site.  I got curious and logged into the site from a different browser and it said sold out.  I then bought it on the other browser that had it in the shopping cart and it is now currently being delivered.
