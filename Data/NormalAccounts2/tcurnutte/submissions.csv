When the whole real money AH came full force I just decided this game wasn't for me. I hate pay to win structures of games and that's basically what it had become. Many games have come since those days WoW, battlefield, cod, destiny and then came the notorious division. I viewed it as a way to get back into a ""dungeon crawler""esque game. 

As with everyone else that left he division and came here, I left because of constant nerfs, shitty Devs, no creativity with the game etc. 

So glad I came back to this game.   I struggled at first because so much had changed. I am still sort of puzzled at maximizing builds but I am learning.  I played with an old WoW buddy last week and was gripping to him about being so far behind. He gave me some advice I'll give to anyone else that as fears they won't be able to understand all the new changes. ""Just keep playing"" 

He basically told me that you really cannot understand the game to its fullest until you put in the time.

There just doesn't seem to be any competition around for pops where I live. Which is in the middle of nowhere.  What's my obligation now ? Is it well passed a point where it's safe to just buy them so I can attempt to trade for something I need?

I have taken advantage of the 30%/30% Hottopic deal that popped up, the EE clearance and various other sales that happened.  I was able to sell some of my older pops from years ago to fund the new collection, plus some money from a couple pay checks and a bonus.  I love these things and they are so fun to collect. 

I am so glad for this Reddit and all the amazing information you guys have brought to me.  Looking forward to another year of collecting! 

If anyone has any Disney ones not shown in the picture few free to send me a DM, also looking for Hikari.

Thanks for all the up votes over the past month or so, all the comments, and all the replies to my DM's!

Below are the pictures of the collection so far, it's kind of a clutters mess until I figure out a good shelving system for my man cave which is under construction.  Also still debating on whether or not to open them and have them posed in front of their boxes.

Pictures are everything I own minus a few shipments that haven't made it to me yet.

The woman said they will be getting another shipment in tomorrow (Thursday December 2. 2015)  My question is this: Do they get shipments daily?  Or every thursday? etc.  I want to know this because I am going to disney here in the next two weeks and I would really love to get these.

Also if anyone else is at disney and happens to see these I would be glad to paypal the money to you!  Just starting out with collecting these again and I absolutely LOVE these exclusives, I love the haunted mansion ride and movie, Also my mancave is disney themed, mickey mouse border, red walls with black chalk paint on bottom, basically everything is disney in my mancave.

This collector/disneyfan would love you all for help!",funkopop,Question about Disney Parks Exclusives,https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/comments/3v8f1c/question_about_disney_parks_exclusives/

So this past Black Friday my cousin convinced me to come out with him and his friend (both are members of this Reddit as well). We waited outside of Gamestop for an hour for the mystery boxes. Once inside I bought my limit of 4 and then was hooked!  Now I first collected pops when marvel came out and I had 1-40ish, this included Loki , red skull, Thor, etc. i ended up selling the majority of my geek supplies due to my second child coming.  I'm glad to say I am in a great spot to start collecting now, it makes it easier only collecting pops instead of everything from figures to comics.  

Luckily for me Black Friday deals were amazing for starting the collection up. It has also helped having his Reddit as such an amazing source for collecting; I find myself loading it up every 30 minutes on my phone so I can read all the awesome new articles.  I've see some of your guys collections and I am amazed!  Glad to be part of this Reddit and glad to be collecting again. 

Hopefully I'll be able to snag a ticket to SDCC this year and grow my collection, maybe even meet some of you guys. Happy hunting guys and gals!
