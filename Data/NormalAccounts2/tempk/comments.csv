1,"So reddit broke earlier!?!...Actually it said maintenance! Either way.
I was wrong, I'm running nvidia on the *nix box (AMD is on the POS I am on now.)and need to lay off the whiskey. I'll edit my original post with the information that seemed to fix the issues for me. Thank you! ",2015-12-15 08:03:27+00:00,cxzjiqq,4,t1_cxzi9yu,3624,debian
2,"Yes...*backs away slowly...lol

It seems to do it more often when running Iceweasel. I switched DE to Xfce and still having the same problem. Any suggestions?",2015-12-15 02:18:34+00:00,cxzehxv,2,t1_cxzee2d,185,debian
3,"That is in my list of things to try. GNOME worked perfectly under Wheezy, though. I have researched a possibility of driver issues related, I had the same problem in the past with Ubuntu and Fedora installations. I know this is a personal question, what DE do you personally recommend rather than GNOME?",2015-12-15 00:29:06+00:00,cxza8uz,2,t1_cxza0p6,356,debian
