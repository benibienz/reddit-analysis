Previously ran Wheezy on the same box and loved it, NEVER crashed, rarely missed a beat. I install Jessie and the box keeps freezing, the screen will distort to diagonal lines in the same color scheme of the desktop(GNOME), within 10 min to an hour of a reboot. I haven't seen anything so far that I would prefer to use Jessie over Wheezy. Reddit and /r/debian give me some reasons to make the switch permanent from Wheezy to Jessie, and some suggestions for debugging the crash/video issue.

Edit: Video issue seems to be fixed:[this forum post was exactly the same issue I was having](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=126013) There was this [link](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers#Version_304.125_.28legacy_GPUs.29) posted in the forum that is a fairly easy walkthrough. Thanks everyone for your input! I'm still requesting suggestions/arguments on why to stick with Jessie and not go back to Wheezy.
