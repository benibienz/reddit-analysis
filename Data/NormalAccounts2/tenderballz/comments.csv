Is this really your first match?? I must say I am rather impressed by your mech control, heat discipline and general awareness!! I was all over the place, missing shots and overheating constantly in my first few weeks of play! 

Good job on locking targets by pressing R. 

Good job being patient till u got a clear shot and maintaining most of the laser burn on target. 

One piece of advice is u may want to remove arm lock in settings. That way u can rotate your arms up and down. The Jenner-F has all 6 energy hp on the arms so that would allow u to shoot up and down. I noticed u wanted to aim up at one point but couldn't.

Another thing: IS light mechs always pack XL engines so blowing the side torsos is a quick way to grab a kill. Your raven opponent had all the armor stripped off the side torsos. Aiming for those would have ended him sooner. 

Other than that, well played and look forward to meeting u in game. ",2015-12-11 18:15:40+00:00,cxvkh50,1,t3_3wejki,1430,OutreachHPG

126,"I bought mine when it was first released and had TONS of fun playing local multiplayer with friends who come over.  Most of the games are free or only cost a couple of bucks.  My favourites are ""Towerfall"" and ""Hidden In Plain Sight"" which are awesome MP games for parties and i believe are unique to the Ouya.

The quality of games, however, are only comparable to those on tablets/mobile phones.  Graphics are so-so and most games are only good for a couple hours or so of single player entertainment.  That's why it is only fun with friends around.

There are non-game apps u can download such as twitch or VLC media player.

Bear in mind that this console is packaged as both a gaming and developer platform.

The sad reality now, as others have already said, is that they have been bought over by Razer who has also bought over their entire game catalogue so by the end of this year, there will be no more online connectivity (read: no new games and no online gameplay).  Ouya will no longer be supported and all the exisiting games will be found on the Nvidia Shield TV.  

So if you are considering buying one NOW, please don't.  it will become worthless in a couple of months.  If you are looking for a cheaper console alternative, go for a Wii.  

Edit: It is also worth noting that the Ouya only comes with ONE controller.  each extra controller costs as much as the console so it can add up to a bit.  I have 4 controllers. =/",2015-10-16 07:03:13+00:00,cw1m8x5,1,t3_3oyghh,4285,gaming
