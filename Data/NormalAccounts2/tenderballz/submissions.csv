All these bugs seem to happen when the spectator enters a player cockpit then returns to free camera ""god mode""

* The spectator is perma-locked into thermal vision even when he returns to spectator ""god mode"".
* The spectator losing the ability to bring up scoreboards/maps/mech indicator on ground and name/hp/mech type annotation above the mech.
These bugs seriously ruin the experience and ought to be looked at.


Anyone else having this problem?

**Jester**

Pros:

* Awesome camou
* 4/5 LL similar playstyle to STK-4N (which i love) but with JJs
* I want a heavy hero and do not want a Firebrand

Cons:

* ~~LL quirks have been removed~~
* doesn't seem particularly effective/popular
* worth spending MC on?

**Sparky**

Pros:

* Hella fast and agile (100+ kph with 7JJ!)
* nice ML quirks
* reviews/builds indicate that it is a pretty effective/competitive mech

Cons:

* Low slung arms (?)
* I already have tons of medium mechs including the GI and YLW
