I think the more you draw a thing, the more comfortable you get with just concentrating on technique over form.  It's why your rock study is a great thing. I find watercolor to be less intuitive of a painting medium than either oil or acrylic. You can't just Paint the Thing-- you've got to practice and build up to Painting the Thing.

153,"I'm sorry to disappoint, but my colors here are watercolor, not ink. :( I'm pretty sure both /u/chasedfw and /u/joshoclast have both used colored ink, though, so they might be able to field those questions better. 

I have used white ink-- Copic opaque white ink, to be exact. It's  thick and extremely opaque, as the name implies. If you apply it too soon (while the other ink is still wet) you get a bit of an  opaque grey where the colors blend (the ink wash snail in my photo collection has that problem.) If you wait to apply, the white is very clear and strong. I used it to add whiskers into [this cat drawing](http://i.imgur.com/P70s5Ll.jpg), as an example. It's meant to be applied in very small amounts for detail work. I imagine trying to combine it with colored inks to get a different shade will lead to opacity problems like I had with the black ink.

I totally get the excitement regarding Inktober. :) I've never worked with ink before this month and kind of dove head-first into things, myself.

As usual, awesome work on the studies. You're really getting the geometry of the anatomy down.

I did what I could to make the face less flat, and I think I managed that pretty well in comparison to the original. I also tweaked the hair a bit-- again, to make it less flat. I'm still not sure I got the background right, and there are spots where I was just messy, but overall, I'm a lot happier with the new piece. It has a little more volume/life to it, which is something I struggle with in my style.

Yes! I agree on the shadows for the 4th piece. I kept futzing with them, but it just kept getting worse. I may go back and soften them up to see if that works better. Thanks again!",2016-09-24 21:23:22+00:00,d80kl4n,3.0,t1_d80k2ct,857.0,ArtistLounge

I'm already fairly self-critical when it comes to, well, everything, but my art in particular is harshly judged. Even my passable work is barely ""good enough"". When I wind up making a piece that well and truly sucks, it leaves me depressed for the rest of the day. I have a very hard time separating myself as a person from myself as an artist, which is my own damage.

I had a pretty hard break with art for reasons that are complicated to explain, so the only one I ever finished was [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKthbeHhcM7/). 

This particular shot I took with my webcam at the time. Half the shots for the project were taken that way, and half were done with my point-and-shoot. 

I still have one or two photos saved up from the project that I may post to RGD later. It's always fascinating to see the images through other people's eyes.

I'm lucky if a quarter of my drawings and sketches are good enough to go into my portfolio, and I'm not sure how to feel about that. Is that good? Bad? Average? I envy people who are able to knock it out of the park every time, but that's definitely not where I am in my skillset now.

I'm trying to be better about not talking down to myself regarding my artwork, but it's hard. I think it's a combination of having higher expectations than I should *(it's lo-fi art. Of course it's not going to resemble the photo dead-on.)*, feeling a little insecure about my art style compared to other people's if I'm being honest, and a sort of general dismissiveness of the time and effort I put into stuff. None of these things are constructive or helpful, but that's where my brain goes.

...I may try an experiment this next week to not make any sort of critical comments regarding my work. Not necessarily to make effusively positive comments about it, but just to cut out the negative. Thank you for making me think about this more.

(It was also my first time drawing a hand in a RGD, so I guess that makes 2 firsts. :P) My favorite is probably the girl and cat picture, even though there are a few problems with it.

I'm back again. :) 

This week I did 3 /r/dailysketch prompts. (Ulysses butterfly, puffin, and waterlily.) I experimented a bit with the puffin and did two different color renderings, one with gouache brushes and one with watercolor in Photoshop. I think I like the gouache the best, but I'm pleased with how all three of those images came out.

 I'm not really happy with either the butterfly or the waterlily, but I think it's probably due to my feelings about the subject matter as much as my paint job. The waterlily came out looking super pop-graphic, which is not what I was expecting at all. (I think it's the weight of the outline I used that does it.) The butterfly is just kind of boring. Both of them were good challenges, at least. 

I'm hoping to start doing some RGD posts again this coming week now that I'm getting my groove back. I also bought some physical, non Photoshop, watercolors that I'm interested in learning how to use. We'll see in a week if I get anywhere with either of those things, heh.

I use a program called Hexels, which basically provides me a pixelized canvas to work on. I use a Wacom tablet to draw the way a person does in Photoshop or other normal graphics programs. I can choose to work one pixel at a time, or I can work up to 4 or 9 at a time with Hexels' variable brush size.  I usually do a combination of  the two methods, especially when it comes to features and details. 

My canvas is usually around 200 pixels on each side, which I then crop to fit the image I make. (So if you made the image *really* small, you won't have to squint to see the end results, heh.)",2016-05-18 17:20:15+00:00,d3agazu,3.0,t1_d3abtfk,5779.0,dailysketch

I use [Hexels](http://www.marmoset.co/hexels). It's a super-cool painting program specifically for hexel/trixel/pixel art. My use of it is a bit, ah, atypical, but I think it works out okay. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get into modular art. It's very intuitive, and the blend mode and color palette tool are absolutely killer. 

(btw, I totally just tweaked the background to be more color-block-y. I think it works better than the gradient I had there before.  I can never stop working on anything, so there may be, like, 3 more changes I make through the day before I finally give up. )",2016-04-27 23:44:14+00:00,d2k0p03,3.0,t1_d2k00pt,1046.0,redditgetsdrawn

Five RGD posts and one /r/dailysketch prompt (Siamese cats). 

I'm starting to get better at my pixel portraits. I'm really happy with 3/5 this week. This was also my first time attempting to draw guys in, like, 5 years, and it didn't go terribly! To be fair, it was also something like 5 years since I drew women before I started doing my portraits. I just have a few weeks' experience drawing ladies now. (And yes, it really has been that long since I've done a life drawing course. Yikes.)

I'm less thrilled with the cat, but that's mostly because I didn't take the time to blend things properly. I've been so focused on doing pixel art lately that my efforts in learning how to paint normally have kind of fallen by the wayside.

563,"Thanks! I use a program called Hexels rather than Photoshop or other normal painting apps. It's designed with pixel, hexel, and trixel (isometric) art in mind. I approach painting in Hexels the same way I do in PS or Krita (my other painting app of choice). I lay in a rough sketch as a base layer, block in shading in a separate layer, block in color in a third layer, and work from there. 

The thing that makes Hexels amazing for doing pixel art over something like Piskel or Pyxel Edit, I think, is the way its brush tool works in terms of blending and opacity. You can get super-painterly effects because of it. I do do more traditional pixel art as well, where I plot each pixel individually, but I like being able to switch between the two styles to get the effect I want.

I totally hear you on the self-criticism front. Every time I post something, whether it's in RGD or DailySketch, I cringe. The important thing is to post anyway. 

I think it's important to think about your work as a progression of skill-- that is, a sum of all the work that went into you being able to make it-- rather than something that stands alone without context. Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who is definitely not at the top of their game, artwise.

I think I'm slowly improving when it comes to drawing people, at least from the shoulders up. I still have a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow.

I get the feeling that I've got, like, a 2 in 4 approval rate of my work by the OPs of my RedditGetsDrawn stuff, but I'm trying not to let that get me down. I know my stuff is a departure from the norm stylistically, and it's okay that not everyone likes it. I need to stop focusing on upvotes and start focusing on whether or not my work is a step forward in my practice, though.

624,"Thanks for asking!

I use a program called [Hexels](http://www.marmoset.co/hexels) for my pixel/trixel/hexel art. It works similar to most digital painting programs, but with a much smaller focus and tool set. It works really well for painting/color blending, though you can't see much of that on this particular sketch. 

As far as the drawing process goes, the key is to decide what level of image fidelity you want to work at. For this drawing, I wanted to be pretty true to life (as far as that goes for pixel art), so I created a large canvas to work on with lots of subdivisions. For the [sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailysketch/comments/4cb0by/day_310_sushi/d1goyi5) drawing I did yesterday, I wanted something a little more abstract/illustrative, so my canvas was smaller/had fewer subdivisions.

Once you know what sort of style you want to work in, it's a lot like other types of digital painting. I rough out the shapes, determine the silhouette I'm going for, rough out the colors, and go to town until I like what I see. I'm far from an expert at it, but I'm always working on getting better. :)

I've been enjoying the new prompts, but I've also been finding that there are more of them that I just flat-out don't know what to do with (the Apple vs Android one, for instance) or have trouble sort of narrowing down into a single subject (ballet, yoga).

As far as everything else goes...

I've really appreciated the variety of the prompts so far (in the two or so weeks since I found the sub, at least). With a couple exceptions, I'd never drawn anything like that before. It's been challenging and fun, and I feel it's making me grow as an artist to try and tackle new material.

I think my favorite prompt so far has been either sad dogs or robots. My least favorite was probably hippies, man, but that's because I suck at doing portraits at the moment.
