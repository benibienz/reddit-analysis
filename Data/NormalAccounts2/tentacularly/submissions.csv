I've been working primarily with pixel art for the past 7-8 months, and I'd like to think I'm pretty decent at it. So of course when October came around, I decided to stop doing pixel art entirely and embrace the madness that was Inktober. 

I say ""madness"" because, before October, I'd never worked in ink before. So what you're going to see if you flip though [this album](http://imgur.com/a/N9s6q) is a progression from (as I said in the title) complete beginner to where I am now. 

The first few pieces in there are actually digital woodcuts rather than physical art. I'd originally planned to do a digital Inktober instead, but seeing everyone else's work convinced me to make the switch. After that, there's a progression from Bic pens, to proper art pens, to brush pens, to ink washes. Washes are my happy place when working with ink, I think. (Washes and cat pictures.)

I mainly wanted to post this because I thought it would be interesting to see what one month of just showing up and making art can do. I don't consider myself an expert by any means, but I think there was a really noticeable improvement. ",ArtistLounge,One more finished Inktober post.

As the title says, I've been organizing a month-long celebration of watercolor painting called RedditPaints. I was inspired by taking part in [Inktober](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober) this year to do something similar with watercolor.

The goal is to paint every day (or every other day, or once a week, whatever fits into your schedule) of the month of November using watercolor. That's pretty much it in terms of rules.  I've put together [a set of reference images that can be used](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditpaints/comments/59cvh4/the_collection_of_potential_source_photos_for/) and [a list of word prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditpaints/comments/59gg1i/word_prompts_for_redditpaints/), but both are really suggestions as to what to do rather than mandatory.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in taking part in, even if it's not every day, please join us over at /r/redditpaints! I'll be posting daily threads throughout the month so that people can showcase their work.  Our hashtag for social media is going to be #RedditPaints if you'd like to participate that way.

This sub was created to serve as a home base for an artist challenge taking place in the month of November. The challenge riffs off of [Inktober](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober) in that participating artists pledge to spend the entire month working with a specific medium-- in this case, watercolour. 

Just like Inktober, this is meant as a personal challenge. Work every day, every other day, once a week, whatever. Just commit to spending that time working with watercolour, and do your best to stick with it.

In the next week, a set of photo references and a list of prompts will go up that artists can use as inspiration for their work. There's no obligation to use either, but it would be interesting to see fellow artists' takes on the same subject.

It's basically just a chance to show up every day (or every other day, or once a week) and develop your watercolor skills, whether you're just beginning or are already an old hand at it.

**What is your preferred medium (E.g Pencils, Paint, Digital etc.)?**  

Both pencils and digital. I've been working a lot more on digital lately, but pencils are where my heart is.


  

**What are you working towards-What are your goals? E.g (The type of style (realism, manga, western), people-characters-landscape etc.)**  

Partly toward being able to render things more correctly/realism, but also working on digital skills with an eye toward both illustration and pixel art. Right now I only sort of have the basics down when it comes to digital painting, and I really want to work on that. I'm better at pixel art, but I want to grow there, too. 


  

**Are you looking for a buddy of a similar level or something more advanced? (N.B. you can have more than one buddy, so if you feel like you want both then leave this question blank)**  

  
Someone more advanced would be nice, but honestly, I'll be happy with whomever.  

  

**How often would you like to share work with your artbuddy?**  

1-2x a week? Or whatever's convenient for you. 

  

**How do you wish to communicate with your artbuddy? (E.g Skype-IRC-Reddit PM etc)**  

Skype is best, but email and Reddit are fine, too.  

  

**Extra info about yourself:**#ARTBUDDYBUT

In addition to the art stuff, I'm a pretty prolific crafter (knitting, crochet, cross-stitch). This can sometimes distract me from drawing, though I try not to let it do so. If you want to talk about crafts in addition to art, I'm totally down for that.

I'm a frequent visitor to /r/dailysketch and a lot of my drawings are taken from prompts there. I'd like to submit to /r/redditgetsdrawn more frequently, but I feel a little intimidated by the general skill level present.

I'm attempting to learn frame animation for my pixel art, so if anyone has any pointers in that regard, I'd be glad to hear them.",ArtBuddy,Art Buddy Wanted,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtBuddy/comments/45znhf/art_buddy_wanted/
