&gt;What do you use to bind the pigment together?

Pardon? Haha I don't get *that* into it, I just crush up beans until they're a paste and presto—bean paint!

&gt;..Also, why?

A couple months ago after a night of drinking (who'da thought, huh?) I randomly got the urge to paint like I used to as a kid. There were no paints in the house so I decided to figure something else out. We had a bunch of old cans of beans in the cupboard and I noticed they were of all different colors and so I crushed some of each up, put them in different bowls, and used an old toothbrush to paint with it on a sheet of paper. I was surprised by how much fun it was and later decided to keep pursuing the 'medium'!

I'd say if you're the one putting the money behind it, you have final say in how it all works. If you want to make a post here outlining it, I'd be more than happy to sticky it for you (at least for a month or so). 

As for where to promote it, here are a few subs I found that might be good:


/r/digitalpainting

/r/IDAP

/r/drawforme

/r/ICanDrawThat

/r/Illustration

/r/Painting

With these two I'd probably message the mods first and ask if you can post something, as their rules seem to say not to post such things:

181,"After all moles have done for us? I say this calls for a change.org campaign. We'll raise signatures to show the people who work at the cave how important this is to people. We will encourage them to do one of the following:

 1) capture some glowworms and feed them to moles (which may be illegal since they're part of the cave attraction) 

or 


2) bring the mountain to molehammed (credit: /u/romps) and bring some moles to the cave and show them all the beauty by holding them as close as possible to it. 

or

3) some other idea for the cave administration to pay tribute to moles that doesn't necessarily involve capturing a mole. I just went down a wikipedia hole and Australia only has [marsupial moles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7uA3YaLPhE), which are only related to other moles in that they are mammals. This provides a remarkable example of convergent evolution between them and other moles (the [golden moles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5eUuPyuYBw) of Africa in particular). They have both developed very similar traits completely independently of one another. I think this will likely show up in a Holy Moley I Didn't Know That! in the future.

We could also even set up a gofundme campaign as long as we got in contact with someone over at the cave and raise money for their efforts. But it would have to be officially set up. 

If anyone has thoughts, I'd like to hear them.",2016-08-24 19:21:51+00:00,d6v1r7h,3.0,t1_d6ui2ca,29935.0,MoleJokes

189,"Haha as long as it's nothing hurtful to others or anything like that, that's actually pretty normal! A lot of people who discover the world of mole jokes for the first time fall in love it. And then it becomes their life for a little while. And that's good, it's healthy to dig yourself down into that creative tunnel for a while and shut out the outside world. Eventually you'll come back up and see the sunshine and remember there are more things you want out of life, but for now don't worry about it so much. You're right where you should be. 

My only advice would be to pace yourself. Don't stretch yourself too thin by working on too many mole projects at once. Because when we do that, it can start to feel like work and we can forget that the whole reason we got into mole jokes in the first place was to have fun. So yes, by all means, push yourself, be thinking about moles all the time, let it envelop you, write jokes every day, collaborate with other mole jokes lovers, make mole videos, do all of it. But know your limits and don't push yourself so hard that you end up snapping a figurative claw off.

While the mole lies in his or her burrow, the crew steps in and unloads tractor-full after tractor-full of dirt on-top of the molehill. They keep a long plastic tube connected to the opening which they will remove at the end of the process to maintain a hole to the surface. They build and build and compact the dirt and add more, getting bigger and bigger until it's a few stories tall. Of course taller is better if the budget allows it. Then to finish it off they transplant some trees into it, put up a few nature walk signs, have some actors dressed as hikers hike it, and boom – mountain out of a molehill. 

Then comes the magic moment. The moment of confused emergence. Imagine the look on its face when it realizes it's on the summit of Mole Mountain!

Tell them about how the tobacco is toasted, never sun-dried, which gives it its unique and delicious taste.  If you have a woman friend who's trying to lose a few pounds, tell her to reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet. That'll do the trick. Carry a pack around with you to let people experience the smooth taste of Lucky Strike cigarettes for themselves.

This. My uncle was in a bad car accident when I was a kid and the doctors told us he was basically braindead but that he could still react to certain things just with his spinal cord. I'll never forget when I went to hug him once and he actually put one of his arms around my back and squeezed. It was so weird and it still freaks me out when I think about it.  Another time we were calling his name and his head jerked right over in our direction. The absolutely weirdest one though was  when a nurse went to grab his arm and he got up out of the bed and started jumping around and doing flips and stuff. He used to be a professional gymnast and the doctors tolds us that it was all just autopilot from his muscle memory but it still freaked you out to see something like that.

One day she blew up and yelled ""Why not just call it what it is at this point – A FUCKING SQUIRREL FEEDER!""  I could tell she was really  mad, and she has a history of anger issues, but (and this is probably bad of me) I thought it would be funny to stoke the fire a little. So I said ""Honey what's wrong? Why are you so angry? It's just a bird feeder."" This set her off and she started throwing things at me. So I said ""I don't understand, do you hate squirrels?"" and started laughing,  and she then started calling the cops and saying she was going to report me for hitting her (something I've never even done). I burst out laughing even harder and said ""Oh no, please, don't do *that!*"" in a real sarcastic tone, and man that set her off even more. The cops eventually came and I was taken away and I told the cops the whole story and they laughed their asses off but unfortunately they still had to take me in. I understood, they were just doing their jobs. They were great guys and we even hung out again after that, and guess where? In a place that sells donuts! I kept ribbing them about it and they laughed so hard they were crying. I called them pigs to their faces and started signing ""cop killer! cop killer!"" as a joke and that had them rolling around on the floor! They said they could use someone like me on the force one day and I said ""Oh yeah, and just *how many donuts would I have to eat to do that?*"" They all then paused and got real serious and the sarge looked real mad and leaned in real close and said ""Hey. Enough."" I got embarrassed and started apologizing and then he interrupted me and said ""But to answer your question, A THOUSAND!"" and he burst out laughing.

503,"Apparently there's some controversy surrounding this. More info:

&gt;In the actual sound recordings he apparently fails to say ""a"" before ""bear"" and says: ""That's one small step for bear, one giant leap for bearkind."" This was generally considered by many to simply be an error of omission on his part. Forelegstrong long insisted he did say ""a bear"" but that it was inaudible, perhaps due to honey on the mic. In Septembear 2006 evidence based on new analysis of the recordings conducted by Peter Shann Furd, a clawmputer programmer whose company Control Bearonics helps physically handicapped bears to use their own nerve impulses to communicate through clawmputers, indicated that Forelegstrong had said the missing ""a."" The debate continues on the matter, as ""Forelegstrong's 'poetic' slip on Moon"" at BearBC News (3 June 2009) reports that more recent analysis by bear linguist John Olcub and bear author Chris Ribee with higher quality recordings indicates that he did not say ""a"".

656,"**The Lemon.** 

You drive a miniature ""new car"" off a ""lot"". It's on a track. Halfway through, it breaks down. You then have to ""call"" (there's a fake phone with a few pre-recorded messages) triple A and wait 45 minutes for them to arrive on the track next to yours. They check out the car and determine that it needs to be towed. Unfortunately since you're only a classic member and not a Plus member, they can only tow you 5 miles free of charge. But here's the thing: the nearest repair shop is **14 miles** away. Now you've got some thinking to do.

After you make your decision, if you choose to be towed, a park employee is called over with a real tow truck and really tows you out of the park and to a real repair shop. You then have to explain to the repair shop attendant that it's all just for a ride and that you don't actually need assistance. At this point, he will be very frustrated that you wasted his time. He will later (in about 3 years) sue the park for doing this so often, and unfortunately since you were part of the decision process, you will have to pay out some damages.",2016-01-13 20:44:38+00:00,cyx27qc,1.0,t3_40tixr,5926.0,AskReddit

Unfortunately I started getting real self-conscious when I realized that so many people were looking at me (I have a *huge* fear of public speaking) and so I kind of froze up and couldn't really think of anything more to say. They then asked me to get down and leave and I said ""Oh why so you can take me to get my trophy for giving a RANT?!"" and they said no, it was because I couldn't be acting like that in the hospital. I knew that's why it was, I was just kidding around, but they thought I was serious I guess. Hate when people think you're serious when you're just joking. The worst part is if you then say you were joking it makes it seem like you care too much what they think of you. So I said nothing.

905,"&gt;How hot was it? 

Let's just say it's called a *lava* lamp for a reason...

&gt;Could you even swallow that shit? 

Throat of steal, my friend. Slid right down my throat, no problem.

&gt;What color? 

Well it is lava, so... (orange).

&gt;Did you pop the top off like it was a beer? 

Yeah and I kept singing ""Ohhh I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, where I'ma gonna go when the volcano blows!"" the whole time. Everyone else was singing along too and they were cheering me on like ""drink it! drink it! drink it!"" and then ""drink, the lava. drink, drink the lava. drink, the lava. drink, drink the lava."" and they were doing these crazy dances and stuff like pretending to be tribal people making a volcano sacrifice or something! I looked over at Mark (my friend) and I swear I saw a whole tribal getup on him, face paint and all haha. But when I looked back it was gone.

&gt;Did you hold the hot glass with your hands too? 

Yep! By the time I got to it had cooled down a little so it wasn't really that hot anyway.

&gt;Did it burn your lips at all? 

Nope. Like I said it had cooled down a bit before I got to it.

&gt;Did you turn it off first, or just grab the shit and drink it? 

It had been off for about 45 minutes.

&gt;Did you put it back afterward like everything was normal?

Yep, spat it right back up into the bottle and presto, good as new! Haha I actually ended up having to go to the hospital to have my stomach pumped. It's actually pretty toxic stuff. :(


&gt;I guess most importantly...why did you do this?

Wanted to impress a girl (shocker, eh?). Happy ending time though: she took the bait, and we've now been married for 2 weeks!

1005,"Imagine that you're at a dinner. And you order the chicken plate, like almost everyone else there. The only one who doesn't order the chicken plate is the man sitting across from you, who instead orders the duck plate. You're taken aback that he would choose to support the murder of ducks. You ask him how he could be so heartless, and you say ""Duck lives matter."" He responds by saying simply that a bird's a bird, and whether it's a chicken, a duck, or heck even a flippin turkey, at the end of the day it's all just food on the table. After considering it for a few minutes you agree that he makes a decent point and decide to order some duck yourself. You instantly fall in love with it.

As the night progresses and everyone's been drinking and having a great time, an old homeless man walks up to your table and says ""All bird lives matter"". This is controversial to all of you because you're already having so much fun drinking and eating and you don't want to be disturbed, which is exactly what he's doing by saying ""All bird lives matter"". 

TL;DR: The phrase ""All bird lives matter"" carries an implicit 'downer' aspect to it. The truth is that yes, some birds may be treated worse than others, but a bird's a bird and at the end of the day you just want to eat something and have a good time doing it without having to think about which bird's lives ""matter more"" than others.

1028,"5 minions!

Haha, but seriously be sure to check out 'Minions' in theaters now!



And don't just take my word for it, here's what the critics are saying!

--------

Minions hilariously imagines centuries in which the little guys have sought to serve the greatest villain they could find, but quickly settles into more conventional cartoon territory.

-Peter Debruge, Variety

-----------

The dungaree- and goggle-wearing yellow sidekicks from the two 'Despicable Me' films are upgraded to leading-minion status in 'Minions,' from directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda.

-Boyd van Hoeij, Hollywood Reporter

-----------


In its own helter-skelter way, Minions achieves a loony symmetry. It starts with evolution and ends with revolution.

-Michael Sragow,
Film Comment Magazine

-----------

With its episodic stream of slapstick gags, Minions has moments of piquant absurdity, but mostly its shrill-but-cutesy anarchy works as a visual sugar rush for the preschool set.

-Liam Lacey, Globe and Mail",2015-07-18 16:55:23+00:00,ct7sxue,1.0,t3_3dqrku,5071.0,AskReddit

It's fine to not love them, hell, it's fine to even be a little annoyed by them. But *hate*?  Maybe if you hate minions you don't belong in the nation that loves them. We love minions dolls, we love minions bananas, we love minions movies (of course), and we **love** the word ""minions"". And when you say you hate minions to us you're basically spitting in our faces.

I told her we were going to have a week-long Hawaiian getaway, and that we were going to go swimming with turtles and see volcanos and all this stuff. I had been building this thing up for months. So the night before the trip,  she asks where the plane tickets are so we have them secured. I tell her to check the closet and when she opens it up, **112** bottles of Hawaiian Punch fall right on her!!! She starts going ""Oh my god, what the hell??"" and I say ""Honey, don't you get it? It's a full week's worth of Hawaiian Punch! We're gonna have a **week-long Hawaiian getaway right here in our apartment!**""

I then told her to come with me to the bathroom where there was something I had to show her. I pulled back the shower curtain to reveal **14 live turtles** in our bathtub that I had found in the swamp behind our house! I said,""Let's go swimming with turtles, baby!"" and pushed her right in before she even had a chance to react! Haha she did not look to happy at this point, but I knew I had to keep going. After all, I promised her a full Hawaiian getaway, and what kind of man would I be if I didn't deliver!!! haha!!!

I then said ""Oh my god, look honey, that volcano's erupting!!!"" and pointed at the toilet which I had painted brown to look like a volcano and threw a full thing of baking soda and vinegar in it and it started foaming over like crazy! Haha.

At this point she couldn't help but laugh  at the whole situation and I go ""Honey, did you *honestly* think I could afford a week long stay in Hawaii??"" And she goes ""Haha I guess you're right."" I threw her a towel and said ""Haha honey now quit messin around with those turtles and dry off and come to bed!""
