There will be many more festivities posted here as the day progresses, including: 

* A Mole Day scavenger hunt! (thanks to /u/romps for the idea) where you could win a month of reddit gold or get some cool mole flair!

* An AMA from the mods of r/MoleJokes ourselves!

* A grassroots boycott on certain companies that sell mole traps and poisons!

However, the mole has a special weapon to help it find other animals underground - an area of bare pink skin on the snout covered in tiny pimples that detect movement and the scents of prey and other moles.

**Q: Wasn't there 25 days left yesterday?**

**A:** Yes. This was a mistake on my part and I take full responsibility for it. After checking and double checking the math, I am now fully confident that the count is correct. The good news is we have a whole extra day than we thought to prepare for the festivities.

#New Mole Video FAQ

**How does this differ from the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df820SOVnkk)?**

The first video shows a mole coming out of a molehill, and then tunneling underground. It also shows it poop, and there is a slideshow of mole pictures at the end. This video shows a mole in a bucket, and then on a blanket. It also shows it being picked up. They also have different songs.

**What is the story behind the mole in this video?**

The description of the video is in Czech and says ""Krtek chycený kočkou byl po natočení vypuštěn zpátky do přírody"", which roughly translates to ""The mole was caught by a cat and released back to nature after.""

**What type of mole is this?**

A European mole, same as in the first video.

**Which mole video should I watch first each day? Does the order matter?**

The order you watch them in is entirely up to you! You can also either watch them back to back or you could watch one in the morning and one in the evening. It's whatever works best for you and fits in with your schedule. Here at /r/MoleJokes, we want to work with you!


**Will there be reminders to watch this in case I forget?**

There will most likely be reminders posted here and there to watch both mole videos, although it isn't guaranteed that they will be posted daily. If you want to make sure you never miss out on a day's viewing, you may find it helpful to set a daily alarm on your phone.

**Between this and the other video, it's starting to add up time-wise. Are there going to be more videos in the future I'm supposed to watch daily as well?**


There very likely will be more mole videos added to the list in the future. If you find it's starting to become tedious to watch them all each day, you can always cut back. All we ask is that you try your best. It's still better to watch even just one mole video than none at all!

#Mole Video FAQ




**Do I need to watch it all the way to the end each time?**

It is highly recommended to watch it from start to finish each time, although of course how much of it you watch and even whether you watch it at all is ultimately up to you.



**What's up with those last still shots that look like they've had their color altered?**

It is not known what the creator of the video had in mind when they added those shots. Regardless, they are pictures of moles and therefore should not take anything away from the video.

**Is the shot around 1:04 showing the mole pooping?**

It does show that, yes. There is no need to be grossed out though, as it should be viewed as just another part of the reality of moles. 


**Can I watch it more than once per day?**

Of course! The ""once per day"" suggestion is just that – a suggestion. You can watch it however many times you'd like!

**This video has inspired me to make my own mole-related video. Am I allowed to post it here?**

Yes! In fact, you are encouraged to!

**What is a limerick anyway?**

A limerick is a form of poetry, especially one in five-line, predominantly anapestic meter with a strict rhyme scheme (AABBA), which is sometimes obscene with humorous intent. The third and fourth lines are usually shorter than the other three. The following example is a limerick of unknown origin:

    The limerick packs laughs anatomical
    Into space that is quite economical.
       But the good ones I've seen
       So seldom are clean
    And the clean ones so seldom are comical.

**Can I still submit regular old bear jokes?**

Of course! 


**Who invented the limerick?**

The limerick form was popularized by Edward Lear in his first Book of Nonsense (1846) and a later work, More Nonsense, Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc. (1872). Lear wrote 212 limericks, mostly considered nonsense literature. It was customary at the time for limericks to accompany an absurd illustration of the same subject, and for the final line of the limerick to be a variant of the first line ending in the same word, but with slight differences that create a nonsensical, circular effect. The humor is not in the ""punch line"" ending but rather in the tension between meaning and its lack.


**Can I still submit limericks after Limerick Day is over?**

Of course! The purpose is to encourage people to try their hand at it who otherwise may not have. And who knows, if it works out it may even become a regular thing!


**When does Limerick Day official begin and end?**

It officially begins at 12:00 AM EDT on April 30, 2016. It ends at 12:00 AM EDT on May 1, 2016.

**How do you pronounce ""limerick""?**

A criminal investigation ultimately resulted in the arrest and conviction of the eight bears directly involved in the heist, as well as 16 others who had indirectly helped them, and the recovery of approximately 60% of the stolen honey. 

All but one of the defendants pleaded guilty. The defendants received sentences ranging from probation for several relatives to 10 years and two months in bear prison for the mastermind bear. Unfortunately, instead of returning to society a rehabilitated bear, his time in prison only seemed to make him more of a har**den**ed criminal. He went on to be involved in several other smaller bank robberies along with several murders, and was eventually sent back to prison where he ended up living out his final days.

Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa, a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie, who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.

Black bears: Be loud and aggressive. They can usually be scared off.

Grizzlies: Play dead. You may get mauled a bit and scratched by claws, but hopefully still alive. The grizzly mostly wants to show dominance and will get bored.

Polar: Might as well try to fight, but you're pretty much screwed. Polar bears are used to being the biggest thing around and see everything else as prey. Run - they'll chase you down and then eat you. Play dead - they'll walk over and eat you sooner. So, might as well go down fighting.


**Edit:** I just realized this isn't even a joke. It's just an answer to a question. Almost seems like a dumb thing to post now that I think about it. :/

Even if this were done as some kind of ""meta joke"" thing, it still wouldn't be funny. It would just be stupid and lame. Just so lame.  If I knew how, I'd remove it this instant. Unfortunately that's beyond my abilities. You see, I'm real dumb. Real lame and real dumb, folks. I'm sorry that I've let you all down. I shouldn't even be here.

What's everyone been up to? Traveling anywhere? Any good bbq? Seen any good fireworks? I had some ribs at my friend Shawn's place and they were soooo good. Fuckin love ribs! He had a whole big cookout, tons of people, flags, fireworks, the whole nine yards. I barely knew anyone there but it was still fun to mingle and at least get my mind off some bad stuff that's been going on in my life lately. 

For those waiting for an update from last week, basically my wife decided she's going to stay with Jeremy (the guy she's been cheating on me with for the last 4 months) and she's threatened to call the cops on me if I come near the house (what a ray of sunshine, eh?). I can see his car there and it fucking pisses me off knowing he's in my fucking house.  I've been staying at my parents' in the meantime. To be honest, in a way though I'm glad it's over because now I can move on with my life. She's a completely different person from the woman I married and we'd been having issues for a while. As for jobs, I must've sent out over 50 resumes so far and I've gotten zero responses, but I'm not letting it get me down. My friend Shawn (same guy who had the bbq) said he might be able to hook me up with something though so we'll see what happens with that.
