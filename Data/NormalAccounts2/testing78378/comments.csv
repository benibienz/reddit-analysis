Even [the NYT more or less agrees](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/should-prostitution-be-a-crime.html) that it's time to end the prohibition of prostitution. If you think that prostitution is wrong because it entails a worker selling his or her body but coal mining is fine, then your moral views have clouded your judgment of labour. Workers of the world need free choice and free agency.

The number of lies and slanders about prostitutes are too many to list; as a category those who sell sex, and especially women who sell sex, have been subject to millennia of calumny. Yet to a large extent, prostitutes are selling a service and are not so different from other people selling other services.

The difference comes in how they're portrayed, which is frequently wrong. Changing minds and correcting misconceptions is part of the /r/truereddit way. This article does or should do both.

Too often, sexuality is conceptualized as being divided between the ""normal"" (that is, surface-level practices and beliefs that are widely admired in the greater culture) and the deviant (that is, deeper practices that are more rarely turned into discourse and that are frequently the object of scorn and ridicule in public places). Yet that division is so blurry as to be false. The relentless way the state persecutes prostitutes is an indication of this vile calumny. Sexual practices are stranger and more divergent than is commonly credited.

Sex workers are commonly framed as being broken, benighted, figures, tricked by Coyote-like men who exploit their sexuality for money. Most don't fit that trope, though. If anything, it's not the sexually powerful sex worker who is benighted, but the boring corporate type, forced into Apollinian conformity, ugly clothes, and empty-headed buzzing that has it worse off. White-collar office work is a kind of death without dying, yet few appreciate it as such.

Sex work lies in a realm of Dionysian excess and pleasure beyond the frumpy confines of hate and the political process. Pleasure should be a right. So should the ability to conduct gratifying work in a gratifying field.

Non-monogamy is having a moment. When your needs for food, shelter, and transport are met, what comes next? What makes life most meaningful and pleasurable?

Sex toys are common among adult women in Western societies, yet they still feel under the larger discourse radar. This article remedies, slightly, that oversight, and explains how the world is shifting towards toys that couples use together. 

We also have a personal connection to the language around using sex toys during sex because we make free-range adult cinema, and some viewers have expressed derision about our use of toys. Those viewers are likely inexperienced or trolling, because sex toys *enhance*  sex, rather than detracting from it or indicating inadequacy, but we'd like to see more accurate information about sex toys and their uses.

No, it isn't. People have a right to sexuality. In this respect parents don't have the right to restrict the OP's sexuality any more than a landlord has to restrict yours. 

It is no more disrespectful for the OP to have sex than for the OP's parents to have sex. It may be popular to treat teenagers as chattel, but they aren't chattel and they have rights and responsibilities of their own. It has long been popular to abrogate sexual rights whenever possible, as Eric Berkowitz describes in [The Boundaries of Desire: A Century of Good Sex, Bad Laws, and Changing Identities](http://www.amazon.com/Boundaries-Desire-Century-Changing-Identities/dp/1619025299). But popularity doesn't make those abrogations right or fair.

Ask if he likes going down on girls. You're more likely to come from cunnilingus than penetration. If he doesn't like going down on girls, find a guy who does. When you find a guy, just ask him if he wants to have sex. Being direct is underrated. Explain that you want to have sex, you like him, and that you want to do it safely and have fun. He'll be taken aback because almost no girls (and few women) are direct about their sexual needs or desires. We live in a culture that discourages women having sex. 

Not having sexual experience means as much or as little as you make of it. If you were a guy posting, everyone here would be saying ""Yeah man! Lose it! Fuck some hotties."" But because you're not everyone here is implying that sexual inexperience is somehow desirable or special. It isn't. 

Perhaps most importantly, pay attention in English class. You don't write like you're 15: you write like you're 8.

111,"&gt; I'm 30- where are ﻿the guys in my age group?

[""Right here""](http://www.reddit.com/user/testing78378/submitted) could be one answer. 

More seriously, I'm not directly in the industry but as I understand it's quite hard to make money from porn, and many in the industry report that even fewer women than men will buy porn. Perhaps this is not true, but, if it isn't, it would seem to constitute a business idea. 

If you can't find the porn you like, why not make it yourself? That's what we do.

We make amateur stuff that has been (upcoming link NSFW) [viewed literally millions of times](http://www.pornhub.com/users/seattle255/videos) and we are in many physical respects relatively average.

115,"&gt; as others have pointed out, finely tuning your selection skills and seeking out men (or women, whatever) who aren't going to just use you

Yes. [That leapt out to me](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3bgsxm/advice_i_have_never_had_sex_with_a_man_who_cared/csmhvtn). There is something going on with selection here: venue, or  the specific kind of guy, or something else. 

[This may also be relevant](http://tuckermax.me/karens-owens-and-the-duke-fuck-list/): 

&gt;What do you think that means when the lowest score goes to the guy who treats her like a hooker, and the highest goes to the one who treats her like a human? It means she wants affection and connection from her sex, except she doesn’t even realize it. The guys aren’t playing that game; they just want to fuck a bunch of girls. She thinks she’s a participant in this game, but she’s not–she’s the one getting exploited, but she doesn’t understand her own emotions enough to see it and change her behavior. That’s the opposite of being empowered.

&gt;Here’s the deal: A woman can be sexually active and explore lots of men, and can do it in an empowering way–but the key to that is SELF-AWARENESS. Karen has none of that. She gave her vagina away like a free refill at McDonald’s to any guy who even held her glance, but then tried to only evaluate the actions of the guys who fucked her, without even giving a mention  to her own behavior or emotions. That’s not empowering. That is being blind to the nature of your own life, which is just sad. Calling her empowered is an embarrassing disservice to women who really are empowered.",2015-06-29 16:17:19+00:00,csmhybg,2,t1_csm0sk5,47907,sex
116,"These are going to be tough questions, but they have to be asked: How many guys have you been with? Have they *all* been like this? 

If the answer is ""a reasonable number"" (and I attach no sex negativity to the number: Mine is pleasurably high) and ""yes,"" then you have to start asking yourself about selection issues. 

Who are you choosing? What contexts are you choosing them in? If you get all these guys who want you to perform  like a porn star, why are you choosing them? Are there other guys who are invisible to you? 

In various contexts I've read comments like, ""The major thing your partners have in common is you."" ",2015-06-29 16:15:24+00:00,csmhvtn,1,t3_3bgsxm,49665,sex

118,"&gt; Pretty much the same answer I give on reddit, which is another question: ""What kind of photography do you want to do?""

Most people don't know. We always say the same thing: ""It doesn't really matter; almost all contemporary cameras are good; pick one you can afford and focus on learning about photography more than the camera you buy."" 

Then we suggestion the A6000, which is in our view the price/performance/size sweet spot right now. Most people want an answer, rather than a long discussion of trade-offs, and we give them that answer. If/when they outgrow the camera, they'll know what they actually want/need.
