286,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Springbank makes a very unique spirit.  The cereal note across the board is always a winner with me (unless theres a bad cask).  This expression: **Longrow 10 year 46%abv** is out of production right now as they have plenty of stock for multiple expressions:  http://www.springbankwhisky.com/whisky/.  I found this with a layer of dust and a beat up box in a local store along with Hazelburn 8year.  

* Color: tan
* Nose: honey strawberries.  Very floral/fragrant and malty.  Lovely, fruity,  pears, peaches, nectarines.  Tiny hint of peat. 
* Taste: malty cereal and peat ridden but no smoke, like highland park. Nicely cleanly sweet.  White pears, tangy nectarines.  Well rounded.  Thin fruity honey.  Mature, oaky oil which gives it a great silky mouthfeel that makes it linger a long time.
* Finish: oh yeah thats what a finish is, read that last sentence again instead of this line. 

Very nice expression from Springbank.  On a scotch spectrum that runs Glenfiddich 12 to Laphroaig 10, this sits right in the middle.  Similar to Highland Park 12 and Macallan fine oak.  Very flavorful, I’d probably prefer this to those right now.  Not in-your-face peat, but a nice little layer of it.  It helped me illustrate the gamut with my wife, who is now getting into the hobby as well...

So when I grabbed the **Willett 10 year old Single Barrel Bourbon 128 proof** from a local grocery store, I didn't think much about it.  I don't know, maybe someone can help me out, where this was sourced from, but its really fucking good.  I wish I hadn't downed half of it before realizing I'll never find this guy again....

* Color: thick brown
* Nose: rich molasses glaze.  heavy nutmeg and sugar.  cola. cookie dough. 
* Taste: amazingly rich and powerfully spicy creamy thick vanilla. classic coke. 
* Finish: strong and super lingering.  fantastic. 

amazing. Right up there with George Stagg for power and deliciousness.  It has immense depth.  lovely complexity and .... I really should have sipped this in the beginning.  damn its yummy.  

&gt;95/100

303,"absolutely.  especially the 21.  Honestly I wasn't going to try any more Old Pulteney's until I started seeing reviews of the 21 and the whisky of the year bs by Jim Murray.  I used to feel that if the basic stuff that a distillery turns out isnt very good, its a sign that I dont care for them.  This, with experience, showed me how wrong I was about that.  

I would definitely try to get a sample of the 21yr.  And don't drink anything peaty before it. ",2016-09-12 18:32:58+00:00,d7jvnha,3.0,t1_d7jv9q0,473.0,Scotch
304,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Looks like I've only reviewed 3 Old Pulteney's including this **Old Pulteney 30 year 44%abv**, but I've had 4.  I never reviewed the 12 because I didn't care to at the time.  Navigator got a 69/100 for me, and thats generous.  The 21 is fantastic.  The 30:

* Color: light
* Nose: briny, tangy, tart malty sweetness. deep honey nectar.   white pepper.  sweet olive oil. 
* Taste: salt, butter, honey glazed donut.  sweet malty peach.    hints of apple, oreo creme, canned pears, orange peel, milk.   
* Finish: long, spice on the end

lovely, delicious.  21 is still better. Really nice bottling.  Beware of the ABV though, there apparently isnt a standard ABV for this one, and if you get the lower proofed 40%, theres a world of difference. Sure it's 30 years old and deserves some dignity, but I'll stick with the 21 for now and maybe try the 17 next.  I hear good things about the 17 but I have nearly a  full bottle of the 21 sitting here to keep me company.

Saw it last night by myself.  Literally zero other people in the movie theater.  Which was nice.  Wish I could say I enjoyed myself though.

The main actors weren't bad.  The **actors** did fine.  Their characters were pretty terrible though and barely flushed out.  They relied on the audience knowing these women from SNL too much and barely set up who they were as people.  And the way there weren't already friends together made little sense and getting together was unnecessarily convoluted. 

Leslie Jone's character?  also didnt bother me.  I knew who that character would be going in, and whatever.  

The Cameos were so forced and terribly done.  All of them. 

The pacing was bad.  The jokes fell flat nearly every time. The setup was rushed.  

Their motivations went two opposite directions.  They set these women up as wanting to find ghosts.... but then also they made weapons?  They were scientists just trying to find ghosts and see that they were real... but then they wanted to destroy them?  didn't work.

Things just didn't go together either.  Its like the director's first time making a movie.  Case in point: 

 &gt;They got their first call and left the building to get in their new Ecto 1.  Patty stops them outside and shows them new outfits she got so that they could look more professional.  They then take the outfits into the vehicle not wearing them but holding them in their laps.  Then they arrive at the location WEARING THE OUTFITS.  Even the driver was dressed in the jumpsuit and boots!

This is just bad direction.  They should have been inside their place, have the suits, mini montage zipping up and then emerging outside the building wearing them.   It just felt super sloppy.  

I exclaimed WHAT THE FUCK several times at the screen, because I was alone.

It had a real overall plastic look to everything too.  Vibrant colors, and the ghost CGI was over the top fake looking.  Why did it all have to be NEON everything?

I never felt like the Ghostbusters were in any danger.  The main villain was a joke.  Half the movie is about callbacks to the original.  There was a GIRL SLIMER!?  Why did they make this movie?!

Ghosts didnt really exist before the bad guy started attracting them, so now that he's dead...  theres nothing to bring in more ghosts.   Oh except maybe Zuul which they had to shoehorn into the post credit scene.  Bullshit. 

It has potential for a franchise, but they fucked this movie up good.  They made it one big joke and the cast played it too jokey.  Chris Hemsworth was funny but in a ridiculous non-believable way. 

Fuck this movie, the only reason to see it is to be able to backup your opinion on it.

1017,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Tex like Signatory, Tex like Highland Park.  together?  yeah its gonna get good, here's my **Highland Park 25 year Signatory 51.2% abv 1988** review.

* Color: tan - who gives a fuck
* Nose: honey cola. very malty. sharp vanilla bean. wax, oak oil.   sawdust.
* Taste: rich vanilla, honey roasted peanuts.  sour dough bread.  pears, white wine.  creamy mouthfeel. oaky. 
* Finish: smooth in, hot crisp out.  

mmmmmmmm real good.   quite different from the other Highland Park 25's I've had.  No sherry here in comparison but damn good.  This just makes me want to have Highland Park Cask Strength though.  yes it does exist and I've reviewed it here.  But why does it make me want more of that?  pricetag.  $500 for the distillery bottling.  $250 for this Signatory.  But i can get the job done that I want in my mouth for cheaper with others.  I have a big problem wasting money at this point and now I have a pass/fail for buying things.  this fails for me to buy... would make a great gift though.

older other HP25 reviews to compare:

**Highland Park 25 year old 96.2 proof**

* Color: typical tan amber
* Nose: big sherry, candied dried fruits.  sweet malted honey and fresh linen/paper/perfume oil
* Taste:  full bodied sweet vanilla and tangy fruits.  Sherried honey, rose, watermelon, tangy citrus and malted strawberries.  rich sweet molasses.  almond butter.  candy corn and big oak.
* Finish: long legs and lingering

&gt;93/100

**Highland Park 25 year old Cadenhead 55.7%abv**

* Color: deep dark orange
* Nose: sweet honey oak.  sherry wood. raspberry oil. straw cereal strawberries. hint of menthol and peat. honeygrahams. dry, fabric. 
* Taste: fruity, fresh, oily.  berries, strawberry shortcake.  honey, nectar, light peat.  tangy juicy raspberries.  rich sugar oak.  sherry, mead, thin molasses. 
* Finish: spicy with air

actually similar to the standard 25 but not maltiness.  higher abv doesnt do enough.

1072,"sure.  simple story, I found the projector at Goodwill.  I replaced the drive band and got some new bulbs.  For years I've been begging my mom to transfer our old Super 8 films.  So when I found this, I went to work on them myself, 126 films from 1974 to 1987 of my family.

So after I was done, what to do with the projector?  Look on ebay for films of course.

Apparently, before home video tape was widely available, they put out copies of Star Wars in Super 8.  But not the whole film, just a ""selected scenes"" version in 1977.  So I found one for $40 or best offer, offered $20 and got it!

The print is a bit red, but I'll transfer it too to digital when I get a chance.  I thought my kids would enjoy watching it today and set it up.

Super 8 was in 4:3

Runs at 24fps.  

its fun.  it jumps forwards a lot, only 16minutes and ends with the Escape from Death Star scene (don't get cocky!)

Hallo WW, Texacer here with another quick review.  When I started my Scotch obsession, one of my first cask strength purchases was Amrut Cask Strength.  An amazingly delicious Indian Whisky.  Pretty much the only whisky making distillery in India worth purchasing from, they do fantastic work on their Single Malts.  I've also had the regular peated, but cask strength is the way to go with Amrut.  So I bought the **Amrut Portonova 62.1%** recently and boy oh boy""

* Color: pinkish orange
* Nose: watermelon, sour grapes, oak.  salted cashews.  sweet fresh earthiness, dry peat.  raisins in their cardboard box. 
* Taste: sweet caramelized port and salted pork.  malty peanut butter and grape jelly sammich.  hints of smoke.  glazed honey ham. 
* Finish: thick and long.

decadent.  really decadent.  Port casks are right up there with Sherry casks.  I think we're going to see many more in the future.  Amrut is a great distillery doing things right.  if you love big flavors, try anything by them that is high ABV, but don't neglect the Fusion.  

&gt; 95/100

recap (need more Amrut)

[Amrut Peated - 85/100](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/ppv59/amrut_peated_a_review/)

[Amrut Cask Strength - 97/100](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhiskeyReviews/comments/m8i5p/amrut_cask_strength/c2yy264)

yes I scored the Cask Strength higher, but that was over 2 years ago and I barely had many reviews under my belt, I think I might like the Portonova more and my scoring scale now would probably put CS around 94.  Still great stuff but maybe not 97 anymore.  funny.

Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Tonight's Whisky is The Glenlivet 15yr French Oak Reserve.  I did enjoy the Glenlivet 12, it was one of my first reviews last year but have since gone past it.  Too many bottles to buy and I can always find it at a bar.  another side note: my brother found an old bottle of Glenlivet 12 from the 1990s, we opened it and it hasn't changed at all in the last 20 years.  

Anyways back to the 15.  I got my bottle for $32 on sale, and have seen it marked at $50 at other places.  40%/80proof.  from the bottle: ""The Glenlivet French Oak Reserve uses selective maturation in New French Limousin Oak casks to create a delightful fusion of dry cedarwood spicy notes and soft fruity and floral aromas.""  ooo laa laa Mr Fancy Pants.  I don't like bottles that oversell, I'm not ripping on them per say but let me judge and don't put it on the front of the label (/rant).  

* Color: Light gold (not sure if colored, anyone?)

* Nose: Light Airy Fruity.  unripened peach peel.  faint Apple Cinnamin. mild sawdust

* Taste: a Tad Spicy on the top.  Sweet and almost delecate.  calm sugar-Citris fruits. 

* Finish: white pepper initially, mellows into sweetness


not a bad dram, tasty and smooth.  not leaps and bounds better than the Glenlivet 12.  very similar.  not worth $50 but it is worth what I paid.  recommended as an after dinner palate cleanser much like the 12.  good for hot summers as a refresher.  would not purchase again unless on sale, but would take as a gift.  not a bad starter scotch either.  cheers

On the high end, the only bottle I've found worthy of a pricetag over $200 is Benrinnes 23.  Magical stuff.  besides that it really is diminishing returns.

I find it hard to buy things over $100 when I have proven good bottles that I'm happy with.  Macallan 25 I found to be especially garbage for it's price.  Much happier with Aberlour 12ncf.  A far superior bottle.

In the same category I love the simple Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, I've told many people its a great buy at a great price.

Glenfarclas puts out great sherried whiskies at what I think are decent prices.  I think the 12 is a steal.

1533,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  I have never let my dislike for Bruichladdich cloud my honest reviewing.  I really couldn't stand all the different weird bottlings they were doing, it annoyed the crap out of me after trying a bunch of mediocre crap from them.  I even asked they Master Distiller if they were going to cool it and get a damn core line going... response being ""NO NEVER!""  Then they sold out and I laughed loudly. I digress, I just enjoy telling that story.  Doesnt matter anymore and I pay zero attention to the distillery since they sold.  But I did get a nice sample of **Cuvee 407 PX 46% abv** to review.  Expensive stuff too.

* Color: rosy amber
* Nose: sweet dark fruits.  raspberry and pomegranate juice. red jammy.  bread dough
* Taste: dates, prunes.  moist and sour doughy, like bread dipped in red wine. decaying grapes.  supple and juicy.  honey, jam, starburst strawberry/cherry
* Finish: medium, juicy to dry. 

a very quality dram.  Without going back and looking at my other reviewed Bruichladdich and scores, I'd say this is one of my more favored reviews from them.  I do quite enjoy Octomore, which this is the opposite of.  Its a nice little jammy number.  I believe I saw one for sale over $200 and though I enjoyed it, its an easy pass for me.

1599,"HERE’S A CHILLING scenario for a Scotch aficionado: You head to your local liquor store, anticipating the purchase of your favorite 12-year-old whisky, only to discover it’s nowhere to be found. You search high and low, eventually settling for a similar but slightly different (aka suspect) bottle.

This scene will soon play out in shops across the country. As a result of high worldwide demand and a finite supply of single-malt Scotch—the production of a single distillery, which can be blended only with water, not other whiskies—some drinkers’ preferred spirits are disappearing.

Lately, brands have been replacing the familiar 10-, 12- and 18-year-old range with whiskies that have no stated ages. Though aged—as all Scotch must be, by law, for at least three years—these “ageless” whiskies are younger than the whiskies they’re replacing and can be released without hitting a specified maturity.

ENLARGE
ILLUSTRATION: BROCK DAVIS
It was really only in the 1960s that single malts started to be sold in the U.S. and in the 1990s that they began to be marketed as superior to blended whiskies (and priced accordingly), with age cited as a key indicator of quality. Perhaps this strategy was too successful.

Now, with hundreds of Scotches available, selecting a bottle without a number to latch onto can be destabilizing. While age is no guarantee of quality—many experts believe excessive time in the barrel leads to too much tannic wood flavor—in the absence of that reference point, brands must bank on consumers being educated enough to know what they like and select accordingly.

“I think you could argue from one perspective that consumers of single malts have become a bit more sophisticated than they were and don’t necessarily need to be given just numbers as a means of differentiating between different types and qualities of product,” said Dr. Nick Morgan, head of whisky outreach for Diageo. The company owns 28 Scotch distilleries, including Talisker, Oban and Lagavulin, and is currently aging 8 million casks in its warehouses.

The move away from age statements allows a brand much greater flexibility and the ability to increase supply without waiting years for stocks to age. “Age statements give you no flexibility whatsoever,” said Mr. Morgan. “They also tie your hands behind your back in terms of innovation. And innovation has always been the lifeblood of the Scotch whisky category.”

Take, for instance, Laphroaig 18-Year-Old. A few months ago the brand announced that what’s currently housed in its distributor warehouses and available in stores will be it for the foreseeable future. A number of different limited-edition whiskies will take its place. Even more unsettling, the brand says it will no longer produce the standard range of whiskies and will, with the exception of the best-selling 10-Year-Old, make different spirits available at different times depending upon supply.

In 2012 (you might want to sit down for this one), the Macallan replaced its 10-, 12- and 15-year-olds in many markets around the world with a series of ageless malts. While the brand maintains it has no plans to do the same in the U.S., it may have little choice if demand continues to rise.

‘Many of the outstanding 10-, 12- and 15-year-old whiskeys may go the way of the dodo.’
It’s little wonder that the Scotch whisky industry as a whole can’t keep up with demand for single malt. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, sales of single malt in the U.S. rose by an astonishing 149% from 2002 to 2014. And the U.S. spends more on single malts than any other country. After decades of losing market share to vodka, wine and beer, brown spirits have been rediscovered by Americans, and producers have flooded the market with a dizzying array of them—cashing in on a growing fascination with traditionally made and artisanal products.

Back in the late 1990s, however, when today’s 18-year-old whiskies were distilled and set aside in barrels to age, forecasts for the volume of single malt that drinkers would demand in 2015 and beyond were relatively modest. Many popular single malts are no longer sold to blenders or independent bottlers. Some brands have gone so far as to buy back single-malt stocks from blenders. A number of distilleries are running around the clock; others have expanded their facilities. But the effect of these moves won’t be felt for years.

In the meantime, many outstanding 10-, 12- and 15-year-olds may go the way of the dodo. While Diageo’s Dr. Morgan assures me that whiskies without age statements are not, by definition, of any lower quality than their quantified counterparts, lovers of aged Scotch will, at the very least, need time to adjust—and whisky to drink while they do.",2016-02-01 00:55:35+00:00,czj64dp,1.0,t3_43lwp8,737.0,Scotch

1714,"Greetings Bourboners, Texacer here with another quick review.  Thanks to /u/dustlesswalnut for the sample of some old ass Dant, as he puts it.  Some of you may be aware of my love for the Bottled in Bond Dant that is currently on the market.  Why?  because its the best bang for your buck bottom shelf mother fucker out there.  I drink it while [snowblowing my driveway](http://i.imgur.com/u6HgdyC.jpg), nothing beats it as its being chilled in a snowpile.  (well, for the price that is).  So I salivated when I saw dusty's post that he got a bottle of **JW Dant 7 year old 43%abv 1968**.  

* Color:  dark bourbon
* Nose:  oak, vanilla fragrance. almond oil.  lovely sweet sugar cookies
* Taste: silky vanilla.  caramel. touch of spice. white sugar.  honey nut cheerios. nutmeg.  
* Finish: lingering oil

this is nice.  no harshness, good aging in the barrel.  I wish there was an aged Dant today, it would hold its own with Buffalo Trace Bourbon.   Its simple, but damn good for how low proof it is. Solid B bourbon.  Reminds me sort of like the Ancient Ancient Age 10 year I have, but a little better.  its a blast from the past and its great trying some history of my [beloved Dant](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1l4c8l/jw_dant_bottled_in_bond_a_review/).  Which, the BIB, still is the best bang for your buck as far as I'm concerned, and I've tried plenty of Cheap Bourbon.   Should you go out and hunt down DANT BIB?  no.  its not an amazing bourbon, its ordinary but thats why I like it. you can turn off the brain when drinking.

1718,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  I've had some loveloss with Balvenie in my time as  a whisky drinker.   I can't deny they make a good product.  A super expensive product though.  ""You pay for age."" Ask me later whose quote that is.  My favorite of the Balvenie's I've had was the 15 bourbon cask.  This is supposed to be an upgrade:  **Balvenie Sherry Cask 15 year 47.8% abv**....

* Color: Scotch
* Nose: red wine tannins. crisp.  sharp.  apples.  ink, paper. watermelon jolly rancher. airy, thin, tart.  crayon
* Taste: fruity, malty sweet.  dry sherry.  pears, honey melon.  tart.  no sulfur, but a bit sour.  watermelon, clove. 
* Finish: dry on the out and a touch of peat at the very end.

.... but it isn't.  its alright, I like the old 15 better, the non sherried.   no wow factor with this one.  reminds me of Highland Park 12 or dark origin honestly.  

I haven't reviewed much for a while, and the last Balvenie I reviewed was the Madiera.  That was much better.  Even the ABV on this 15 can't put it over the edge for me.  ABV isn't everything, but it should have helped this dram go farther.  eh, in the end its just another boring B graded sherried whisky.  Most of the Balvenies I've had hover around the 89-90 range.  Its all the same spirit that has been aged differently or finished in different kinds of barrels.  You can tell the profile of their spirit pretty easily, its soft and light with some touches of whatever it has been matured in.  no peat, no smoke... well even the Peated Cask barely had any compared to a real Islay.

Though I haven't been a huge fan of regular Glendronach and more of a fan of the age stated and cs Macallans, I couldn't pass up the **Glendronach Cask Strength 55.2 % abv Batch 2** when I found it because it has all the things I like in a sherried whisky, especially the ABV.  

* Color: reddy
* Nose: red ripe fruits, strawberry and creme.  a bit medical astringent in a good way.  agave and aloe.  sherry, like usual sherry but with some milk to it. hints of nutty brown sugar. 
* Taste: that creamy sherry, pow!  rich sweet and salty fruit.  those creamsavers (lifesavers) strawberry candy.   raisins, honey glazed ham.  juicy and sour. 
* Finish:  long, salt on the end

good stuff, not my favorite sherry cask strength, but pretty darn good.  doesnt break 90 because it doesnt taste matured enough.  we'll see if my 18 single barrel glendro does though...  


89/100


so what do you see in the photo?

Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Somehow I've let this one fall through the cracks.  I've reviewed Ardbeg 10, Ardbeg Alligator, Ardbeg Supvernova, Ardbeg Uigeadail, and Ardbeg Rollercoaster but have forgetton the Corryvreckan.  114.2 proof!  as I sit here watching the Wire in my leopard print snuggie, I figured I would make myself useful.  this Ardbeg takes it's name from the worlds second largest whirlpool.  

* Color: light golden
* Nose: sweet smokey flowers and gasoline nectar. gooseberries, melted butter.
* Taste: spicey pepper mellon.  earthy, honey-roasted toasted blueberries and wheat bread with charred vannila and peanut butter.
* Finish: hot flash and stays hot right up to the next sip.


Ardbeg is a strong son of a gun.  its never timid or bland.  it'll grow hair on your chest (sorry Scotchitas).  I really enjoy this expression. Its butterier than the other Ardbeg I've had.

might have contaminants in your water.  I dont use my home water because it has a lot of iron and ruins the flavor.

if you want to water it down you can, but use something super clean or it interferes.   bottled water is usually good.

but you dont have to put anything in it and you can enjoy it.  check out the [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vawB2eCdPPfZxg0Qdw12CgrB-qCtxKX5_2due01tSqw/edit?hl=en_US)

As for differences in Glens, the Fiddich is more on the Green Pears kind of flavor.

So I didn't buy another bottle or sample for this review.  I made my own.

couple weeks ago I bought a nice Dry Sack 15 year old Oloroso from Jerez spain.  The sherry is very rich and nice by itself.  

I wanted to experiment though.  For years I've said the La Satan tasted like they just dumped some sherry into a barrel and called it a day.  It doesnt meld well and is very unbalanced.

So I put my money where my mouth is and did just that.  I dumped some sherry into a bottle of Glenmorangie Original.  I waited a couple weeks to see what would happen.

The results.  Its okay.  Not amazing.  Honestly though, I think its better than lasantar.  Its very nonsubtle and sherry forward.  Young tasting almost.  But still, I think its drinkable.

Now, Glenmorangie DOESNT do this, they mature for 2 years in ex sherry barrels.  

Dont think they have to though!

most whisky on the shelf at your local stores are the same for many years.  slight variations per year but mostly the same.  

and most of them that are reviewed are in the B category.  Most bourbon has vanilla notes.  The whisky industry has been stable until recently.

I dont think Blind Reviews are bad, but I don't think they are better either.

I can see though, your point about reviewing a certain way because you know what it is.  I try my best never to do that.  Sometimes I'll go back much later and say ""it couldnt be that good"" and then I retaste and nope, nailed it.

but I may be one of the least biased members out there.  I dont give a shit where anything comes from or how its bottled, design, etc.  Just give me good whisky.  I review based on Nose and Taste. ",2015-11-25 00:40:37+00:00,cxc228x,1.0,t3_3u59r6,3607.0,whisky

Earlier tonight I found a sign at a local liquor store that I frequent that was posted and say that I could find this amazing stuff behind the register, like its some gift from Valhalla.  

I'm not doing a full review.  It takes something special for me to do full reviews anymore.  This stuff.... is *okay*.  

I get a lot of anise and the finish is long.  It's not great.  I'd give it a 75/100 being generous.  

Despite the fact that Mr M gets money from his reviews, I'd say I've given just as much thought on this, and my palate is on par with his.  I would weigh our opinions with the same weight.  

I weigh all opinions on whisky with the same weight.  because IT IS ALL OPINION.

that being said, I'm pretty sure I'm not an alcoholic, given I don't crave whisky from the moment I get up until I get home from work at 11pm.  I don't run to a bottle.  I don't NEED it.  I have a large collection of open bottles and not a large collection of empties in the recycle.  

I could probably drink less and some nights I honestly just forget to have a nightcap.  

but i do enjoy drinking.

I was told when I was young that if you ""enjoy the taste of alcohol, you're an alcoholic"".  Which has made zero sense since I was told that.  

Wouldn't you be an alcoholic if you still drink alcohol and HATE the taste?  

What's the purpose of drinking it, if not enjoying the taste?  I never understood that.  

I would probably drink whisky every night if it didn't have alcohol in it too, I don't get black out drunk and honestly don't drink to get tipsy, I just love the amazing flavors.  

there.  now I can link to this comment if this question gets posted again tomorrow.

2554,"my personal opinion is less people would buy a male calendar or even a calendar of just whisky glasses.  

I've been picked on in the past for being the guy who only drinks whisky at the bars.  But if a woman orders one, it's ""cool"".  Because its a slight minority in our hobby.  And the majority would probably buy something of the opposite from them. 

for some reason men are looked at as posers when drinking scotch (younger men I should say).  Fedora wearers etc.  We know this is stupid but its what I've experienced personally.  A bunch of dudes drinking whisky in a calendar would seem ""neckbeardy"".  

plus keeping it to one specific idea is better than a mishmash.  ",2015-11-11 21:13:08+00:00,cwwxz72,8.0,t1_cwwxscr,297.0,whisky

also, it was just my creative idea to do this.  I could have come up with Puppies and Drams too, but I wouldn't personally buy one. 

edit: also it would be nice to spotlight the women drinkers of our whisky network.  theres this stigma that we are only men in the network.  plenty of nice females come here and it would be nice to recognize them. ",2015-11-11 21:04:14+00:00,cwwxmyo,6.0,t1_cwwxg8m,285.0,whisky

Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another review in my Laphroaig series.   Laphroaig Cask Strength 10yr old is a monster.  Bottled at 56.3% or 112.6 proof.  I guess they haven't been doing a CS for very long as the bottle is marked BATCH 002 DEC. 10.  So thats kind of neat.  I missed the first edition and I hear the 3rd editions are out now.  I bought mine for ~$60usd.  


It is of course delicious.  And powerful.  Its basically the regular 10 that's obviously not been watered down.  I'm enjoying this more and more and searching for more Cask Strengths.  So long liver, Hello more intense flavor.

* 
Color: red gold amber

* 
Nose: Tar, tobacco, oak soaked seawater and  mist, old comfy leather, hint of licorice and coal

* 
Taste: salty brine, wood-smoked filet, medicinal, carbon glazed coffee, savory burnt sugar, toffeed peat.  

* 
Finish: slow spice to hot flash and subsides into a mellow burn out.

So good.  So really very good.  I feel like I'm cheating on the regular Laphroaig 10, but its ok baby I still love you.  Its a more intense situation with this beast.  If you've had the regular 10 just imagine a more concentrated version.  Very richly flavored as the truthful label proclaims. I believe the Lagavulin 12 year old is also cask strength, must find.

&gt;**Laphroaig Cask Strength: 95/100**


ps, I've been asked to go over how I taste/smell/write/review and I shall break that all down after I finish off my Laphroaig run with the mighty quarter cask.

And that is why people don't super praise or recommend them often.  Subtle can be good but most of the it is boring.  

OP is asking about subtle whiskies like I listed, but not about the broad use of it in whisky.  I can find subtle notes in all whisky.  But a just subtle whisky produced in Scotland is going to taste mostly the same because the ingredients and way it is made are mostly similar. 

For years now though I've recommended Glenmorangie Original for just the reason of its subtle simplicity for beginners.  Its light and not much to it and great for getting into Scotch.

No there is no rule that says going back on a trade is not allowed.  

Trades are a person to person thing.  If you want to put in a ""prenuptial agreement"" about the deal, that has to be done at the user level.  We mods cannot watch every trade here, we only facilitate the forum and flair system as best as we can.  

Broken deals are still rare here and this one took until it shipped to happen.  If the negger (sorry) backs out, then its up to them if they feel they want to keep their cred and return with shipping paid.  

Its all about Credibility here.  It might taste sour to have a deal fall through but it doesn't have to be the end of the world.

After yesterday's sacrifice of reviewing Macallan Lame Cask, I thought maybe (since I don't review often enough anymore) that my palate and reviewing ability has degraded from nonuse.

* Color: nothing noteworthy from sample but see photo
* Nose: rich juicy prunes/dates/raisins/grapes.  sultanas, sherry, leather, dark chocolate. 
* Taste: sweet syrupy dates.  deep, rich sherry.  seriously… rich.  I could make ice cream out of this.  nutmeg, cocoa, vanilla raisins.    
* Finish: long and fruity

No, I'm not retarded.  Here's an example of how well Sherry and Malt can work together and how sweet a Scotch can be with out being sickening.  Its like melted butter.  Decadent.

hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Something I've been meaning to review for a bit, because it's great for beginners.  **Black Bottle 80 proof**


* Color: rich E150
* Nose: mild smoke, airy sea salt, grain spirit, sweet peat
* Taste: smooth peatsmoke, sweet medicinal malty iodine.  caramel honey.  
* Finish: silky and medium bodied

a respectable blend and the only Islay blend available that I know of. they could ease off the neutral a tad. Even as I've reach 130 reviews (some not posted, some bourbon) I still can enjoy this despite being an inexpensive, simple blend.  It's a good way to try a bottle of Islay for cheap. Just be careful where you buy it.  It's a ~$20 bottle, don't pay more than that or you're getting ripped off.

3003,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  This isn't going to go well.  I've been seeing the **Macallan Rare Cask 43%abv** around for about a year now.  Its pretty.  But that usually means whats inside is crap and thats all that matters to me.  I love Macallan Cask Strength.   I enjoy the 12 and the 18 is okay.  The fine oak line was decent too.  The 25 was over-aged.  This bottle holds no age statement, but it says RARE!  So it must be good!  Well... J&amp;B also says Rare on it....  

* Color: copper

* Nose: sweet thin acidic strawberries.  paper.  light, weak-ass.  mildly jammy. 

* Taste: sharply acidic sweet, mildly saccharine.  no sulfur at least. is there such a fruit called Lameberry?  because this has lameberry.  nothing to it really, somewhat bitter.  weak-ass. 

* Finish: bad aftertaste actually.  bitter, kinda sad. 

Weak Ass Bitch!  Maybe Macallan was jealous of Johnnie Walker Blue Label and decided ""Hey, we can make a super weak, crap bottling too!  We just have to concentrate on the way the bottle looks"".  The bottle is huge btw, like a 1.75 of Grey Goose tall.  

Now you might say, 'Tex - you've just had a bunch of nice stuff in your life and this is probably still really good'

Nope, not it at all.  I poured a glass of Macallan 12 right next to this ""rare"" cask and took a sip after I reviewed the RC.  Holy Crapballs was it flavorful!  yeah, the 12 was super dense and luscious in comparison.  I was trying so hard to get a read on the RC that my senses were being stretched.  By the time I got to the 12, blam, huge notes for that.  

The Rare Cask is one of the worst whiskies I've ever had because it is SO BORING and has barely any flavor to it.  I wasn't suprised that I didnt find it amazing, but I was surprised that is was so bad.  I thought Maybe it would match the 18; not even close. 

Whats rare about Macallan nowadays is a good bottling. Do not buy this, don't even try it in a bar.  Fuck this shit.

This is just about the opposite of what your post is asking for and theres a reason I bring it up that I'll get to in a minute.

Check this out quick:  https://vimeo.com/6135949

If you get a chance, track down the ""Desperate Man Blues"" documentary about Joe Bussard.  He's opinionated but you can see why.

I've been really into pre-war blues this year and it becomes a bit of a rabbit hole.  There were a ton of musicians in the early 1900s to record 78s and a bunch have been preserved as it was recorded.  Bless youtube for letting us all share these amazing works.

Without this period, most of what we listened to including the Beatles and Rolling Stones wouldnt exist.  This music is what those groups listened to and wanted to sort of emulate.   It is the purest of Blues as far as I'm concerned.  It hasn't been processed, theres no reverb and most of the ones I love have no electricity.  Just a man and a guitar.

If you love blues, do yourself a favor and go to its roots and start searching around.  

Some favorites you may recognize besides Robert Johnson:

* [Blind William Jefferson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNj2BXW852g)

* [Leadbelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsfcUZBMSSg)

* [Charley Patton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGsAh2jx6JA)

* [Barbecue Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xem111DGaUo)

and my personal Favorite:

* [David Honeyboy Edwards](https://vimeo.com/13763500)

Just youtube - prewar blues and you'll find a ton.  Its all unedited, unprocessed pure Americana.  Love it.  

While you are looking for HIGH QUALITY recordings of recent blues albums, you let go of needing that with these old recordings.  You fall in love with the surface scratches and noise, you don't need super clean recordings, its just gets you back to only listening for enjoyment.  At least that's me.  

It amazes me how much music was produced in the early 1900s and it had so much diversity with so little.  Just a man and a guitar could make so much. 

I suggest getting a bunch of these old recordings from Leadbelly and Robert Johnson and put them on a portable device with speakers.  Go outside to somewhere relatively quiet, smoke a cigar, sip some whisky and just chill.  You'll get it pretty easy.  

And I don't pretend to know you, I'm sure you enjoy music just fine, I'm just trying to be broad for any reader.  You don't need super high end audiophile equipment to enjoy music.  Sometimes you can enjoy it more with less.  I sure do. ",2015-09-29 04:48:08+00:00,cvhs67y,3.0,t1_cvhomtq,6886.0,audiophile

3116,"In October, a central London venue will play host to a small group of buyers, drinks writers and bartenders, gathered together (with obligatory Moleskine notebooks) for one of the most important tasting events in the whisky calendar: the preview of the annual Special Releases. This showcase of around a dozen bottlings from Diageo’s most hallowed distilleries frequently includes rarities from Talisker, Lagavulin and Caol Ila, but there are two names that always cause a particular stir round the tasting table: Port Ellen and Brora.

The reason this pair are so especially alluring is they represent the pinnacle of the “silent” or “lost” distilleries, a class of single malts from closed distilleries that includes some of the most sought-after, and investable, whiskies on the market. Out of production since 1983, and with stocks dwindling all the time, Port Ellen and Brora are, quite simply, the definition of limited edition.

The first Special Releases saw the light of day in 2010, and since then the value of Port Ellen and Brora has shot up – in 2011, a Port Ellen Special Release would have set you back around £300, while last year’s release had a price of £2,200. Whether one can afford these bottles, though, is not really the issue – it’s whether one can get hold of them in the first place. With an official release typically numbering around 3,000 bottles, competition for whiskies of this sort is fierce.

“We’re now starting to see people who only buy whisky from silent distilleries,” says Andy Simpson, co-founder of Rarewhisky101.com, the brokerage and consultancy that publishes the go-to index for rare whisky sales around the world. “The two that people most often start with are the cult Port Ellen and Brora, but virtually every single one of the closed distilleries is currently proving very investable.”

There are around 30 lost distilleries on the market, most of which were founded in the boom days of whisky production in the 1800s, when Scotland had more than 200 distilleries (today it has just over 100). Dramatic fluctuations in the demand for whisky during the 20th century meant that by the 1980s around half of these distilleries had fallen silent. A great surplus of casks languished unappreciated for another decade, until a blossoming single malt market prompted companies like Diageo to revisit its archives.

The great irony is that virtually all of these now-desirable whiskies were originally destined for blending (the single malt market as we know it today, where esoteric flavour profiles and uniqueness are prized, only really got going towards the end of the 1980s). This means that not all of them make drinkable drams in their own right – in many cases, what you’re buying is a piece of history. The best examples, though, represent some really superlative liquid.

Hence the fuss about Port Ellen, an Islay malt with a complex, heavily peated style that malt maniacs adore. The most recent Special Release (distilled 1978, 35yo, 56.5 per cent alcohol by volume, 2,964 bottles, £2,400) was particularly compelling – citrus peel in black chocolate, suede, a little tarmac and the sweet- and-salt of a sun-bleached, seaside jetty. A whisky that leaves you nosing the glass long after the contents have been drunk.

For me, though, there is nothing quite as seductive as a fine Brora. Famous for producing malts with a signature scented wax note, this Highland distillery showcases peat in a guise that’s rather more refined. The 2014 Special Release – a 35-year-old (dist 1978, 48.6 per cent abv, £1,200) – was innocent and experienced all at once, marrying the energy of jasmine, moss and sea air with the wisdom of beeswax and old tobacco tins.

Another celebrated name in the pantheon of lost distilleries is Rosebank (from £499), whose closure was described as a “grievous loss” by the late whisky authority Michael Jackson. “It’s a great Lowland spirit,” says Simpson, “triple-distilled and something different. Really classy and elegant.”

But savvy buyers are also beginning to look at lesser‑known lost distilleries, according to Lee Tomlinson, general manager at whisky merchants Milroy’s of Soho. “People have always wanted Port Ellen, but now they’re asking for quirkier whiskies like Glenury Royal, which allow you to taste something really scarce at a more reasonable price. The 36-year-old has a very classic Speyside/Highland style, with a complexity that’s not unlike an old unpeated Brora. You’ll pay about £500 for one of these.”

It’s worth noting that lost-distillery whiskies take one of two forms: “official releases”, like Diageo’s Special Releases, which are bottlings produced by the company that owns the distillery, or “independent bottlings”, which are produced by companies who hand-select particular casks and release them under their own label. If you’re purely looking for an investment, then official bottlings are the way to go, as they tend to fetch a higher price. If you’re intent on actually tasting the liquid, however, then boutiquey independent bottlings, with all their attendant quirks, can offer an exciting way of exploring the lost distilleries at significantly less expense.

“Certainly if I were entering this market for the first time, I’d be going with indie bottles from classic silent stills, as in many cases they offer far better value than official bottlings,” says Simpson. “The average price for an official release of Port Ellen is currently just over £800, while an independent one is just over £300. Yes,official releases will always have a little more prestige. But if you’re drinking these, as I like to do, just to see what it’s like, you’d rather risk £300 than £800.” What’s more, says Simpson, the average price for independent bottlings is now growing faster than official releases. So they’re the ones to watch, even for the investor.

Cask selection is a fine art, so if you’re going the independent route, then stick with a well-established name like Gordon &amp; MacPhail (Rare Old Mosstowie 1979, £550) or Douglas Laing, as these have the expertise – as well as the connections – to secure the best liquid.  

But the cult of the lost distillery is no longer confined to Scotland. The Japanese lost distillery Karuizawa has lately been causing a frenzy at auction, achieving prices that have left even the most seasoned whisky traders slack-jawed in amazement. “Karuizawa has gone berserk, outperforming Scotch,” says Simpson. “Some people were buying bottles several years ago for £100-£150 that are now worth £2,500-£3,000. It’s staggering.”

Established in 1955 in the foothills of an active volcano, these heavily sherried, broad-shouldered malts have a richness and concentration reminiscent of some of the very finest Highland Park and Glenfarclas. A standout is the Karuizawa 1983, 28-year-old Noh Cask No 7576, which interweaves rain-flecked bonfires, dates and treacle with a whiff of smoky lavender. Despite the formidable 57.2 per cent abv it doesn’t need taming with water – its power is more of the slow-burning variety that warms you from within.

Another lost distillery from Japan that has proved highly sought-after in recent years is Hanyu. Established in the 1940s, when Japan was starting to build its blended whisky industry, Hanyu was closed in 2000, leaving the founder’s grandson, Ichiro Akuto, to salvage the last 400 casks from the distillery’s new owners. “He pretty much rescued them from the wrecking ball,” says Marcin Miller, co-founder of the Number One Drinks Company, the distributor that helped kick‑start the trade in Japanese whisky when it began exporting Hanyu in 2006, before gaining the sole rights to distribute the whiskies of Karuizawa and Japan’s most precocious newcomer, Chichibu.   

Hanyu is most famous for its coveted “Card Series” of 54, beautiful small-batch bottlings designed to resemble a pack of playing cards. A highlight among these is The Joker ($1,910, 57.7 per cent abv, available from Dekanta), a vatting of Hanyu casks distilled between 1985 and 2000. Supple and generous, with a combination of luscious honeydew melon, figs and delicately singed toastiness, this whisky has a mouthwatering quality that makes me think of the “Drink Me” potion in Alice in Wonderland, where cherry tart, pineapple, custard, roast turkey, toffee and hot, buttered toast come together in one palate-defying whole.

Needless to say, these are all hard to come by – if you’re intent on buying a whole bottle then it’s usually either a case of bidding for one at auction, or keeping a beady eye on listings at the world’s three leading retailers for Japanese whisky: The Whisky Exchange, La Maison du Whisky and the new Tokyo-based online retailer Dekant¯a.

If you’re content with a dram, however, then the new Bull in a China Shop near London’s Liverpool Street has several rare Hanyus and Karuizawas to choose from. Roka and Zuma restaurants also boast an ultra-limited, bespoke bottling of Hanyu that is absolutely delicious. If you’re more in the market for a taste from one of the Scottish lost distilleries, head to the aforementioned Milroy’s of Soho, where you can enjoy a huge selection of rarities by the dram, among the copper and casks of the ground-floor bar or as part of a more in-depth tasting session in the basement bar below.

“Lost-distillery whiskies are being quite heavily fought for, and I don’t see that changing,” says Simpson. “But they’re not just investments,” he adds. “You’re also getting people drinking these things because they’re whisky fanatics. There are plenty of people who are consuming Port Ellen and Brora right now.”

According to him, it's the best fucking thing in the goddamn world and I have to agree, it's amazing and you should all go to the stores right fucking now and clear the shelves!  to the review!-

* Color: light bourbon
* Nose: oak and vanilla. acetone. latex. ice cream cone
* Taste: all vanilla.  nutmeg.   hotness.  oaky. 
* Finish: medium

like drinking vanilla extract.  nothing really else to it.  its not that its so much as bad, as it is completely one noted.  the nose is quite fragrant for what it is.  too sweet.  Pretty..pritty.....prittay.... shitty.  I don't think this is Whiskey, it might be a vanilla Liqueur.   Sickly almost, like how some Canadian Whiskies taste like maple syrup. Go buy it everyone, if you're retarded.   *No offense to actual retards.

Greetings Bourboners, Texacer here with another ~~quick~~ review.  right now, there is a slight drought when it comes to great wheated bourbon.  My love will always go to Weller as the king, until it is dethroned in the future.  Because of course! -companies are currently scrambling to make their own super awesome wheated bourbons.  ITS SO HOT RIGHT NOW.  Let me say, I do enjoy the regular Maker's Mark bottling currently on the shelf.  Its perfectly fine whisky (it does say ""whisky"" on the bottle).  But it has always seemed to lack a real good punch. 

In the not-so-distant past we saw the 42 proof Maker's get the shit kicked out of it by fans of Maker's.  They claimed to be part of this whole bourbon shortage that is really mostly affecting Buffalo Trace right now, really.   So they lowered the proof.  Well then lo and behold they suddenly get a Cask Strength to market?  Which is it boys?  Shortage?  then how can you put out a CS?  More on that in a bit...

**Makers Mark Cask Strength first batch 113.2 proof**

* Color: Red 
* Nose: buttery vanilla.  cinnamon and nutmeg. brown sugar.  flour. deep.  candied raisins.  sweet sour molasses cookie.
* Taste: red hots candy. more cinnamon and vanilla/nutmeg.   its rich.  red pepper.  gingersnaps.  thin mouthfeel.  
* Finish: long

decent stuff.  crisp.  I like it for sure.  Its a slightly amped up version of regular makers.  But its not aged enough to make it great.  Its crisp, and a bit young.  The nose is very nice but the palate is lacking anything beyond regular makers.  Its just more concentrated.  Which usually I like.  I seek out CS versions of bottlings on purpose because I enjoy the concentration.  I don't really think that works the same with this one.  I think water kind of helps the regular Maker's be more palatable.   I believe age is why the other CS' I enjoy are successful. 

I'll liken this CS to Coffee.  you can make coffee stronger, concentrating it, but you don't necessarily make it better that way.  It can get very bitter and watering it down to a certain concentration can really make it delicious. 

bottom line.  good, not great.  needs more age to be much better than regular which is growing on me more.  its young and brash.  

I did not look at my other Maker's Scores before doing this, or notes for that matter.  Turns out I gave Maker's Mark an 83 and the Maker's 46 an 84.  Which is funny because I gave this an:

&gt;85/100

Honestly now that I've had all three, I'd probably put regular Maker's at an 85 as well and boot the 46 down to 83.  The 46, after having a couple bottles, is NOT better than the regular Maker's Mark.  its different, but not better.

So how can they put a Cask Strength to market, when they were claiming shortage?  Easy:  the CS makes more money for the distillery with less spirit. 

A cask strength 750ml bottle of Makers Mark will be about $70.  Which is about 3 times the amount of a regular bottle of Maker's.

The difference is that extra 23 proof. You're paying about 46 bucks extra for that added 23 proof.  Someone might be able to explain it better than me below because I'm sleepy, but I believe if you watered down the CS, you wouldnt get anywhere near 3 bottles of regular makers at 90 proof.  make sense?  you cant got the other way to get regular makers, higher proof, so they gotcha.

3300,"It's Labor Day, bourboners.  Which means I'm sitting here are work while everyone else gets to BBQ.  What better way to spend my time here than to post a review of something nice.  I recently was able to grab three bottles of Ancient Ancient Age 10 **year**.  More on that in a bit, but I thought it would be fun first to go back 2years and requote my old review of Ancient Ancient Age 10 **Star**.

---

**Sept 2013**

I've heard good things about Ancient Ancient 10 year old, unfortunately I sampled some **Ancient Ancient Age 10 star 90 proof** instead.  

* Color: wood
* Nose: mellow wood.  Glue.  sweet lacquer.  Nutty.  All mild.
* Taste: sour vanilla.  light bitter spiced fruitcake.  one note, lame. 
* Finish: blah, nothing to it.

another inferior “whiskey”, but at least I didnt buy it (thanks Rusty!).  its the only Ancient Whiskey I've had but I doubt I'd bother with the regular Ancient and I'm sure the 10 year old is long gone.  Its not completely awful but its very weak.   oh well.  to the bottom shelf with you. 

&gt; 65/100

---

Fast Forward now and on a whim I bought the **Ancient Ancient Age 10 year** and its 86 proof to boot.  Which is less abv than the Star.... and a shit ton better.


* Color: Bourbon
* Nose: coffee.  toffee.  vanilla. nicely nutty.  
* Taste: buttery.  hazelnut and vanilla. silky heat.  sweet cocoa.  
* Finish: charming. 

simple yet nice.  good ol fashioned bourbon.  This stuff is silky vanilla and has zero harsh youngness to it.  I'm sad its gone, I hope I can track down another bottle somewhere but if its any consolation to ya'll you can still enjoy the same [Mash Bill](http://i.imgur.com/0GV1R31.jpg).  

If I was looking at that mash bill list, I would have chosen Eagle Rare to be what it most tastes like, though less fruity.  But now, I will mourn the death of AAA10year with my Rock Hill Farms.

I made my son that tape and got him a walkman for his Starlord costume last year.

then I got him a tape deck to play in his room.  then more tapes for him to listen to.

now I have a deck in the garage that I make tapes for to listen to when I'm working out there.  

got my daughter a tape boombox now.  

Its fun and I like the physical media.  I like making tapes for my kids and me.  If I made them CDs, those things would be scratched so bad within and day and unplayable. Tapes can be thrown around and cost very little.  

I made a tape of star wars music for my son to play when he's playing with his lego star wars toys in his room.  Its awesome to hear him play that and ""battle""

started reaming last night. shaping up nicely. 

more pics:  http://imgur.com/a/xu8ty

one of the pipes had blockage from years of smoking, so I drilled it out carefully.  Sanded the tops, will buff later with carnuba.  Soaked the stems in water and dawn overnight.  I didn't have any oxyclean left but this worked fine.  Going to take a magic eraser to the stems next.

3524,"Hello Scotchit, Texacer here with another quick review.  Something old yet still high proofed.  Sherried and Signatory!  A match made in ... uh...  my basement?  I've never had a Blair Athol before but with everything put into place, it has to be a winner!  **Blair Athol 25 year 1988 62.1%abv**

* Color: deep scotch color
* Nose: dusty, barbershop, bitter wood char.  sharp sherry.  sour fruit intenseness.  
* Taste: hot sharp sherried malt. cherries, red grapes, syrupy. heat, dryness, pinch of salt. A bit off, bitter… over-oaked. odd sulfur. 
* Finish: a bit of a hot mess

its not a winner!  its very flavorful yes, but the sulfur and oak are very prominent.  the malt has a hard time showing through.  A little water helped tame it a bit but not for the much better.  disappointed, but luckily it was only a sample.

Hopefully this year he'll come around and knock off the shit with me.  I'm a damn good customer, treat me like one. ",2015-08-13 02:27:02+00:00,cu15h87,3.0,t1_cu15b73,302.0,bourbon

smooth is relative and only useful per person.   If you want to get into single malts next, start with something like Glenmorangie Original, its very easy to drink, light, easy to pick apart. I suggest using a wine glass to open it up.  

if you're looking for something closer to Black, maybe Highland Park 12.

4189,"Greetings Bourboners, Texacer here with another quick review.  On my quest to find the best-bottom-bourbon I've come across some still aged stated **Very Old Barton 6 year old 86 proof**.  not to be confused with [this bullshit](http://i.imgur.com/I9Luq2D.jpg) on the right.  more and more age statements being dropped every year, standby for Eagle Rare and Elijah Craig to lose theirs soon.  I still hold the notion that age statements dont mean much to me but let me clarify that:  *Dropping an Age Statement and not having one to begin with are two different things.*  More on that post... 

* Color: Bourbon
* Nose: hot, honey, sour dough.  molasses cookies. 
* Taste: brown sugar, vanilla oak.  flour.  heat.  nutmeg. silky. peppery
* Finish: pleasant, decent.

I see why people like this, sort of hot tasting in comparison to the AAA10 though.  I liked it but won't mourn its passing that much since theres others I can buy regularly.

&gt;84/100

back to my rant.  I've recently traded a Mac Cs to get some older Old Wellers with age statements.  They are 7 years old and fantastic stuff.   Noticeably better than the current stuff (which I still love too).  But its interesting that more places are having to drop age statements to meet demands.  Quality does seem to be dropping in some places, however there are still plenty of bottles out there that are fine to drink.  I am mourning the passing of Ancient Ancient Age 10 year because 10 star is shit.  I even emailed them to ask if its ever coming back: Nope.  

My point though, about dropping it vs never having one is different though.  I have no problem with whiskies that are NAS as long as they are good.  It seems though that dropping the age on established bottles IS an indicator of decline in quality.  

Now, this might have a positive effect in the future though.  Decline in quality loses customers.  Losing customers in the current condition the market is in can be good for us future customers.  Demand is high, distilleries are producing a ton more whiskey and the longer stuff on the shelf sits, the more likely barrels will sit in warehouses longer.  We may see some great age stated whiskies return in the future from large capacity stock piles and low demand can drive prices down.  Lets hope.",2015-07-19 21:07:43+00:00,ct8z7am,1.0,t3_3dve9m,5.0,bourbon

Luckily I always keep an empty around in case something like this happens.  I tried getting as much cork out as possible with a tweezers but it still fell into the bottle.  Lots of particles.  

If you know me, you know I had real cork.  Fucking Cork needs to go.  Use synthetic or Screwcaps please!  This shit happens all the time; I see posts in the network about it.  Cork ruins whiskey, it dissolves in the spirit and kills the flavor.  theres no reason to use real cork for whisky.  Wine is different because it wont dissolve in wine, high proof does it. 

shit sticks to the inside of the lip if someone had the bottle lying down or something:  http://i.imgur.com/DfbyDeB.jpg

I don't have a metal strainer so I thought I'd try something new.  Jam a towel into the opening and use a funnel to strain it, as seen in the post photo.

http://i.imgur.com/0iiCyAu.jpg

It worked very slowly and I figured the cloth was porous enough that it would let all the liquid through but not the cork particles. 

I transferred the whole bottle and all seemed well. Then I removed the towel.  Shit.

The towel was soaked.  Even though the liquid was going straight into the bottle, it stills seeped up and over.

---

Five glasses held the future. Five bourbons waited. Only one would emerge with the coveted title of the Holy Grail.

Buffalo Trace's Single Oak Project began more than 12 years ago when warehouse legend Ronnie Eddins led an expedition deep into the woods to hand-select 96 trees. While there were no attendants shuffling coconut shells, this folly did take on Arthurian tones, beginning with the first question, ""What if?""

Such are the musings of whiskey wonder boy, master distiller Harlen Wheatley, who's not content to wear his laurels on the seat of his pants. ""What if,"" he wondered, ""we could really quantify what is going on during maturation inside of the barrels?""

With the enthusiastic ""Yes"" from distillery chief Mark Brown, the team chose 96 white oaks, and made 192 barrels—one from the top half of the tree, the other from the bottom. Other variables included the size of the wood grain, the char, the recipe (wheat or rye based bourbon), entry proof and warehouse type. It's every geek's whiskey-soaked dream.

192 unique barrels of bourbon whiskey, aged for eight years, were bottled and then released over a four year period. After 5,086 user reviews on the project website, the best-scoring whiskeys were narrowed to five fine examples.

In the beginning

Four years ago, before the project was announced, I sat in Harlen Wheatley's office interviewing him for another story. I asked him ""What if,"" and he got quiet and turned a kind of pale you only find in Kentucky. Later, Buffalo Trace's PR maven Amy Preske asked if I could come back in a few weeks. She wouldn't tell me why.

IMG_1865

That second meeting was me and a collection of some of the best whiskey writers in the world. I was so out of my league that I did my best to keep quiet. Wheatley and Brown told us about the Single Oak Project, had us sample the first releases and then simply said, ""We'll see you in four years.""

We continued to receive small samples of each of the 192 barrels, and even the deepest skeptic couldn't help but admit that, all things being equal, even a rank neophyte could taste the difference in whiskeys aged in barrels made from the top and bottom halves of the same tree.

Finally, we got the call to return to Frankfort.

Is there a 'perfect' whiskey?

It's no small amount of hubris to dub a project, even unofficially, a search for the Holy Grail of whiskey. There are so many variables, hundreds of unique, identifiable flavors and combinations that can number in the millions.

Then there's the fact that you may not like what I like. You may prefer a great nose with a clean finish, while I might want a little more bite and a finish that's more muscular. If there truly is ""no accounting for some people's tastes,"" then how could a panel of nine writers and one master distiller elect one whiskey to rule them all?

IMG_1861

Well, the short answer is we can't, nor was that the intention. Did Buffalo Trace gain new insight into the chemical workings of the wood, as well as a way to quantify the taste preferences of thousands of consumers? Absolutely, and in that sense, this expensive playground exercise was worth it.

It also spawned their next venture, the mysterious Warehouse X. ""I don't think anyone understands warehouse design,"" said Brown while showing us their new facility, where they are even studying the effect of light on the aging barrels.

Buffalo Trace is not the only distiller trying to digitize and define the art and mystery of whiskey making, but they certainly seem to be the most aggressive and public about it. They won't share their secrets, but they at least show you what they are doing.

Time to judge

So, we sat down to judge. The winner was statistically the strongest but it was far from being the universal favorite. In fact it was second in my voting, but then again, my comrades at the table drink and rate whiskey for a living.

If you were lucky enough to find any of these small, elegant bottles on the liquor store shelves, it was Barrel #80 that won. Here's what was in it:

IMG_1846
Inside the breezeway of Warehouse X, Buffalo Trace Distillery’s experimental aging facility. (Photo: Jim Myers / The Tennessean)
""The Single Oak Project bourbon aged in barrel #80 was rye recipe bourbon, entered into a barrel made from oak harvested from the bottom half of the tree with staves seasoned for 12 months. The grain size of the wood was considered average and the barrel received a number four char inside. The whiskey entered the barrel at 125 proof and was aged in a concrete floor warehouse.""

Sexy, no? And hauntingly similar to the way Buffalo Trace's flagship bourbon is made. Hmmm?

Wheatley will now lead a team to try and find trees like that one, harvest the bottoms and reproduce the winning formula. In 2025 it will be ready for release.

This is a game for patient people, and sadly Mr. Eddins never got to try a drop. It shows why, in my mind, aging is still an art and that paying $20 for a standard bourbon is infinitely better than paying $25 (or more!) for some un-aged hogwash surreptitiously labeled ""moonshine.""

Is this the once and future ""Holy Grail"" of all whiskeys? No, but it sure was fun pretending to be a gallant knight with a seat at the table.

* Taste: sweet melted butter, salted peat.  yellow cake, hay, almonds, sherry, strawberry.  warm honey.  malted cereal.  cocoa/nesqik powder. 
* Finish: medium length

it does taste a little young, but I still like it.  A bit firery.  you really get the sherried compared to the malt/peat of the regular 12 year old which I find more balanced.  I still think this is very good though and am not disappointed.  the packaging is dumb and I dont care what story they are trying to tell. I do enjoy some Highland Park bottlings, however I believe its the next distillery to get a too-big head and destroy itself like Macallan.  Look at the Norse god bottlings, while good they want ungodly amounts of money for them and its just dumb to me.  Dont do it Highland Park, go back to just making good whisky, keep your fan base please.

not special to me, but the age does add a nice dimension to the mouth.  I know people go crazy for this and the rest of the BTAC and I get it.  I'm just not crazy about it given other things I've had in the weird rye families.  I would probably grab one to trade in the future but I won't search like crazy, which I've stopped doing for most things anyway.  ramble ramble.   love you bye.
