So, Chip said he wanted to do the offline version of an AMA but then went ahead and answered questions directly onto reddit.  Which is cool.  You might not have noticed, but it was mentioned in the Roundup.

I have transposed all the answers and questions into that above doc for archiving purposes and its easier to read I think.

there are more accounts out there that post our content.  it's going to happen, and most of the time, it drives people from places like twitter to our subs.  some of these accounts can be beneficial and some can just take directly from us.  Thats the internet folks.  Reddit.com is this exact thing, its the reason I'm here.  Reddit aggregates posts from all over so I can lazily look at my front page and see whats on all over the internet today.  

food for thought.  

we had our fun and in the midst of it all, an [Anthony Bourdain AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/53p6kb/i_am_anthony_bourdain_and_im_really_good_at/d7v16gh) put us into the trending subs for a day and garnered us a lot of exposure.

My bottle wouldnt open easy so I ended up spilling too much and wiped it up with a paper towel. 

As I went to throw the towel away I noticed it felt hot.  I looked at it and it began to smoke.  

I've known this about some wood stains or varnish but didn't even think about Super Glue.  

- So, LPT, even more caution using super glue, it can set cotton and paper on fire if too much is absorbed.

- Secondary LPT, if you need to start a fire, I guess this is a way?  A very toxic way, **do not inhale the fumes**.

not specifically the poster or the funny side, but the topic.

I've seen this topic come up a couple times now about, in fact it came up across the border today:  [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/4p4jnh/full_transparency/)

Product Transparency.  

now, I know I've done a pretty popular thread explaining Johnnie Walker Blue:  [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1t920v/johnnie_walker_blue_explanation_thread/)

But I really don't give much of a shit besides what type of whisky it is, what abv it is, and what distillery it came from (blends too).  also, maybe a cask type or finish type.  thats about it.

I've tasted whisky the whole gamut and theres good stuff from top the bottom.  

I see people make huge deals of age statements vs NAS.  Where stuff is matured, how its mature, by whom, what stills used, where grain comes from, what type of wood from what location, exact dates of what has been done to it, etc etc.

IMHO, who cares.  If the whisky is good, drink it.  If you HATE a certain whisky because it has coloring or has been charcoal filtered, or doesn't have an age statement on the bottle, you're missing the whole original point of whisky.  

Drinking for pleasure.  

At this point, I know what I like and usually where to get it.  I'll try whatever is available too, but for the life of me, I don't care much about the rest of the info some of you NEED.  

I know its stupid and cliche to go:  AM I THE ONLY ONE?!

but, sometimes i feel like it.  

qualifiers:  

* products that drop age statements usually are worse than previous
* Just because a new bottling doesn't have an age statement, doesn't make it bad
* Blue needed to be dissected so people are aware of its lameness. 

enjoy your whisky folks.  don't overthink every glass.

I keep internet through time warner for something like $50 a month which gets reimbursed for work reasons.  We have amazon prime too, but never use it. 

Honestly the take-away from all this, we watch less shit tv.  Spend less on shit tv.  care less about shit tv.  

I honestly dont understand why cable companies are still thriving besides eating customers that ""know no better""

We used to spend $90 a month (less the internet from reimbursement or it would be $140) and if we had to pay full, we just saved $1600 a year.  $1k without reimburse.

Not missing it at all.  A thousand dollars I can better spend on Scotch whisky.....

1. [1 month in, Wheat Toast needs some Jam](https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/3qgh5q/1_month_in_wheat_toast/)

tl;dr- I blended Weller 107 and Laphroaig 10 cask strength, then added some DrySack Sherry 15 to created a vatted blend.  I originally thought the wheated profile would match the Laphroaig nicely but it really didn't.  So then the experiment switched to see if you could just add sherry to a whisky to make something good, instead of maturing in ex-sherry or seasoned sherry barrels.  Results were decent in the end, it tastes drinkable and not the worst thing I've ever had in my mouth. 

---

After that month, I just kind of left it.  I did an experiment with Glenmorangie Original where I added some sherry directly to the bottle and I think turned out better than La Santa.  I added too much sherry to the wheat toast I think but it did take the edge off the crappy dirty taste and smoke, so mission was accomplished.  

What to do next?  I waited a while and then enlisted 3 reviewers from /r/sampleswap hoping enough time had passed that they wouldn't remember my project.  All I said was the whisky was rare, which it is!  The ONLY bottle in the world like it.

all three, while super created and fun to read did an excellent job reviewing my sample.  I am very pleased with the results.  It got decent scores.  I couldn't just post with my word only.  I invite these three to offer any finishing remarks below.  

I now have a bottle of Port that I'm going to experiment with, but I believe I was successful in proving what I wanted in the end.  You can add sherry to your whisky for a decent result and yes it does feel like cheating.  Just don't add too much and blends may vary but also change over time.  Adding a little sherry to a shit whisky might save it, just like people like to add small staves.  

I hope you enjoyed this little experiment.

We made a nice elegant, simple yet effective design together in hopes of getting it made through the same site as the /r/bourbon glass.  Well that didn't work out, they decided to be ""difficult about the design"", putting it nicely.  It was too intricate for them. So it didn't work out.

Started work with another company and things started off better.  [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2fwmdn/rscotch_glasses_update_and_poll/)

The new company had promise, sent me a terrible rushed sample and then dropped off the face of the earth.  

So I got discouraged.

I dropped it for over a year but it has always been in the back of my mind because all the work we did and the interest was there. 
 
Then one day recently -   [Kismet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTLCBpFZd90).  

That's right.  That's how I hooked up with a real company to get this shit done!

My photos don't do it justice but here's a couple snaps I've thrown up on reddit the last couple days to see if people would notice:

* [From their site](http://www.etchedlaserart.com/image/cache/data/glencairn/SCOTCHIT%20Mockup-500x500.png)


These are laser etched, that means it'll never rub off or come off in the wash, not silk screen.  Professionally made, they did our design proud.  


---

Full disclosure, Myself and the other great mods here DO NOT receive any money from this company for doing this.  I've done all the leg work on my free time because I love this community.  I hope everyone who buys one displays it with pride and enjoys them.

Hopefully in the future we can do design number 2, and get some Copitas going.  But first steps here, lets see how this goes.  Etched Laser Art has been a great company to deal with, we've been going back and forth for less than a month.  

Cheers everyone!  Slainte!

Obviously this isnt for everyone since there are tons of people subscribed here so don't bitch to me below about how you hate your parents or shit okay?

If you have parents still, and you love them (completely understand when people dont) and don't have a gift to give them despite wanting to, write them a thank you letter.

My parents tell me every year they don't want anything and I can understand that, I have kids now and don't expect them to give me anything.  Its all about giving down. 

Unless your parents really want something, give them whatever they want.

But if you still have no idea at this last minute what to give them, but want to show your appreciation, write them a letter each.  If you're blessed enough (not in a religious way) to have both your parents and you respect them, had a good childhood, let them know before it becomes too late.  And its easier to write it down.  I have a hard time saying everything that needs to be said at a given time, I took a couple hours and went back and forth while writing my letters.  

Take this and do what you want with it as it fits your life.

I did this this year, it only came to me yesterday and I went through my life and picked out different aspects that I remember fondly that directly were influenced by my parents.  My dad showing me how to shoot a bb gun as a kid, or my mom taking me on a camping trip.  

write it all down, and give them the letter for the Holiday.   

its simple and probably one of the best gifts I could give my parents, a true thank you.  

Happy Whatever to you subscribers

Kylo puts his helmet right in Darth Vader's ashes when he takes it off during interrogation.  Maybe it gives him some sith power ups!  I wonder who collected the ashes, since it would only take a single rain to wash them away, it had to be Luke for safe keeping.  I bet Kylo found them in Luke's personal belongings and it drove him to the Dark Side

1. Rey has a dream (that Kylo sees in her mind) of going to an Ocean and living on an Island.  Which is exactly where Luke is found in the end.  Something more is going on there with those two.  I know people think its Luke's daughter, I think more likely she was being trained by Luke, and is another child of Han.  They decided since Ben went bad, to hide her for a long time.  Though, in a real shitty fashion.   Luke probably tried to use mind control to make people forget about her because of the danger she could be in, but Kylo knows who she is and this is why he gets emotional when hearing a ""girl"" helped BB escape. 

1. The ending was okay, upon second viewing I see Luke could be looking at a gravestone but it is still unclear.   It was great that he looked like an old luke, his hood was worn.  I just wish he would have uttered at least one phrase:  ""hello there"".

1. Chewie knows who Rey is, Han says Chewie likes her.  He was giving her the knowing eyes when they entered Luke's planet.  

1. Luke's lightsaber was most likely found stuck in the Cloud City's waste hatches.  Lando went back there and one of his workers gave it to him.  He kept it secret and eventually either lost in gambling or gave it to Maz for safe keeping.  When I rewatched Empire Strikes Back, it looks like what falls into Bespin is only Luke's hand.  

1. In the trailer Maz gives Leia the Lightsaber http://i.imgur.com/QfWeLNt.jpg, I wonder where they were going with that since it didn't leave Finn's hands after he got it.  Maybe Leia had a bigger role originally, maybe used the force or maybe it was trimmed for time.  We didn't get to see Maz again after the attack.  https://youtu.be/ngElkyQ6Rhs?t=51s but this is clearly her giving the Lightsaber to Leia

1. it was good to see Ackbar and Nien Nunb again.

I saw a recent skirmish here over whether or not calling a Woman ""fucking manly"" was appropriate.

Let me reiterated for those of you asshats that missed the initial memo when I created this fucking place.


A place to enjoy and appreciate Manly things. Not a place for Fucking Douchebaggery.


We use the term ""Fucking Manly"" to describe anyone who is a respectable badass.  

We use Manly to describe Humans.  Woman has MAN in it.  Mankind.  

If you don't like my use of the definition, tough fucking shit.

We are here to respect any and all of Mankind that is great or exceeds the standard life of man.  

And also to appreciate any kind of heightened individuals that can be role models for us to emulate.

This Sub is also to enjoy the qualities of life that make living worth it.  Look at the sidebar quick.

There are many links to subs that a lot of us can enjoy.  If you look at all of them and think to yourself, only a man can enjoy all these things, then you're a fucking moron.  

---

Going forward if I see any shitty sexism by anyone, I will remove it.

I am also going to regulate content better.  No more ""this"" posts without some context in the title at least.  

No bad MEMEs. 

Again, don't like it, fuck off.

I am now the sole mod here.  Discretion of the sub is mine.  

For those that get this place and enjoy it, keep on keeping on.

Difficulty Levels in gaming - Easy, Hard, Insane!

You can change settings in some games to make it ""harder"".

Though in most games I don't think that is really true.  I'll use Gears of War for example.  

When Gears came out I was just getting into xbox and achievements.  I loved getting achievements and prided myself on being able to collect each one.   Well that includes beating the game on INSANE level of difficulty.  Sure when I did it, I felt accomplished, but it also led to a lot of stress and huge frustration getting there.  

The problem I have with games like Gears of War and their difficulty setting is this:  its not actually more of a difficult game, you just die easier and enemies die harder.  

That's not as much of a challenge as it is frustrating.  

It would be better if when you change the difficulty settings, the enemies get smarter, or the level is more challenging to complete.  It shouldn't be about the level of life and the number of bullets one can take.  

Same with the new Transformer's game, or any of the Batman Arkham games.  You change the difficulty in those and you just die easier and it takes more hits to kill the enemies.  That's really not fun or inventive.  

So now, in my older age, I just play games on Easy and have a blast.  I don't break or throw controllers!  I don't get stressed out, I just have fun playing.  Achievements don't mean anything to me anymore if theyre just going to be no fun to play.  

but what about alternate endings?!  well theres youtube for that.  

anyone else share this kind of thought process ?",gaming,Difficulty,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3vu2jl/difficulty/

While many of the leading figures put in large sums of money, the widow only put in two small coins.  It may seem that the widow's gift was inconsequential.  However, her gift was the greatest; not because of the amount but because of her need.  She had every reason to not give and yet she gives all she had, while those who put in large amounts only gave from their surplus wealth.  The widow is a model of gratitude and generosity; virtues that we are all called to by Jesus.  Gratitude because by giving from her need she witnesses to the reality that all we have is a gift from God.  She is a model of generosity because her gift signifies that she is willing to give all for the glory of God""

So in essence, we know you don't have a lot of money and you were thinking of not giving us any so you can live your life, but really you should give because its even better for you in the eyes of Jesus! we swear!  Dont be selfish with the little money you have!  We need more crackers and franzia!

It wasn't going well so I decided to keep adding things, and bought some 15 year old Sherry to mix in.  It appears to be working better now and I'm going to wait another month to see what happens.

In the meantime, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/3qs0ju/what_scotch_should_i_add_sherry_to/) to see what else I should add the Oloroso to for fun.  I came up with Glenmoranige Original 10 year old.  Because its very light and nice and SUBTLE. (too many people don't grasp that word)

So I did, I bought some Glenmo O and dumped some sherry into it.

What Scotch do you think would benefit from a little sherry infusion?  I may go buy one based on the best answer.

I love those two whiskies and very unscientifically mixed some together in an old Rock Hill Farms decanter.  80% Weller to 20% Laphroaig, give or take an error margin of -+20%....

It sounded good.  It didn't taste good.  In fact as last noted it turned rather dirty and reminded me of Bowmore.  yuck.

1 month in, what I've named Wheat Toast, felt like a failure.

So what do?!

I decided to do this - http://imgur.com/cBiOpvk.jpg

I got to thinking, what really is the difference between using a sherry seasoned cask and just dumping some sherry into a barrel with whisky?

So I bought this Dry Sack, Oloroso Sherry, from Jerez Spain made with Pedro Ximenez grapes.  

This stuff smells and tastes like Macallan Cask Strength, because it is what Macallan had been using actually.  Or so the label says. 

So now I've created Sherried Wheat Toast. 

And so far, it aint bad.  The sherry has tamed the smoke and it doesnt taste dirty anymore.  I'll probably add a little more and wait another month.

In the mean time, I may make some other Sherried Whiskies since I have a big bottle of it anyway!  It is a fortified wine at 20% abv, so it'll last a bit.  Hmmm, what should I sherry next?",whisky,1 month in: Wheat Toast,https://www.reddit.com/r/whisky/comments/3qgh5q/1_month_in_wheat_toast/

I saw it yesterday and passed for $101.  Promise of hope was okay not great.  Wheat Whisky I loved and want another bottle.  

Seems that this bottling isn't CRAP.  but it also isn't amazing.  Price is probably a bit inflated and I'd rather buy some 10 year old SAOS bourbon instead.

I took advice from my last post, I didn't do a 50:50

instead I took [this much](http://i.imgur.com/NwWx6gX.jpg) Weller

and then filled the [rest](http://i.imgur.com/hGWWV1N.jpg) with Laphroaig CS 10

I decided to use a couple of my single barrel Wellers, since I have 7 of them, why not. 

Something I've noticed about single barrel wellers compared to the regular, is that they can have a touch of harshness.  Any harshness though, after 4 days of melding has fallen away.   

The Laphroaig's smokey vanilla is already working some magic, and you guys were right that smoke would have way overpowered any weller.  even at this mixture, Laphroaig powers through.  Though now, its a bit rounder in flavor.  The weller gets in there and compliments nicely.  I can picture this after day 30 being its own nice sipper.  

My assumption at this point is that the Laphroaig smoke will mellow out.  I used a brand new bottle, just opened.  

I'm not doing a formal review of notes, rather just some things I'm noticing along the way.

It was also a great excuse to reuse the Rock Hill Farms ""decanter"".

Someone last post said it doesn't matter what Bourbon Mashbill was matured in the cask that Laphroaig uses, it wouldn't have any effect.  I don't think that is true, wont there still be residual juice in the wood? Won't that affect the maturing of Laphroaig?  I'm not 100% on this, but its another reason I wanted to use a wheated bourbon for this blend, because Laphroaig is matured in ex-makers barrels.  Weller just seemed like a good fit.

I have an empty Rock Hill Farm's container which I enjoy the look of.  I'm wondering what proportions I should use, or just 50:50

I'm thinking this will work pretty well because Laphroaig uses Ex-Makers Mark barrels to mature their whisky and being another better wheated Bourbon, Weller seems to be a good choice to meld. 

I want to let it sit for a bout a month and report back.  I did a quick mix in a glass 50:50 and it tasted pretty good to me. 

Some times I find home blends to be less than their parts.  But I have hope for this one.

Instead: 

* Buffalo Trace Wheated Bourbon 12 year Bottled in Bond 
* Buffalo Trace Wheated Bourbon 7 year 107 proof
* Buffalo Trace Wheated Bourbon 7 year 90 proof


It would alleviate the current boom crap and make the things I like from them more available.  It almost seems like Makers Mark is trying to do just that. 

Get rid of Weller and Pappy.  Create a new product and concentrate on making that THE best they can.  The older bottlings are clearly better from what I've had and are suffering now from a number of things happening at the distillery.

Now according to their website ~~they close at midnight~~.  I can't get there until 11.  Maybe they'll stay open a bit longer if theres a crowd. 


Feel free to start early, that'll be up to you guys to decide, 9p or 10p.  Whatever, to me, I've been there multiple times.  

I picked them because the selection is awesome and prices reasonable.

I also see with my own eyes the day to day posts of people looking for answers and getting their posts downvoted almost immediately.  I don't like it.  I agree with some we have a voting problem in our subs sometimes, here seems to be the most problematic.

This sub has always been open for all and lightly moderated.  We have [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rc42T5WPQw2AakwWCZBLKAztHA9a-4sjAlvVvsyxFFc/edit) sure, but these aren't hard rules where the mods enforce them.  

This is how the sub wanted to be, 10,000 people ago.  It's growing all the time and I was nearly gutted a couple times for suggesting we do actual rules here and moderate heavier. 

Honestly I wish the voting system didn't allow downvotes at all, but that's not possible.  Some people downvote posts that are close to theirs so that theirs succeed more.  Others just hold grudges, including yours truly, I always see my post downvoted.  But I dont care, I post to interact and get comments.  The points I've accrued here do not matter.   What always matters to me when posting is conversation.  

Back to the original point. What are your thoughts on the sub, give me the positive and negative and what you think about rules.

Right now I'm knocking around doing some rules that would help us keep the monotony down... such as our highly successful antiPappyFall2014 campaign.

it is possible Reddit isn't going to last forever.

I hope you keep a real copy of your review in another format.  

Such as, google docs or a home word doc.  

I'm not trying to fear monger, this is what I've done for a long time though.  You never know, maybe one day reddit will delete all old posts like how they archive now after 6 months.

Recommendations for decent Waterproof point and shoot cameras?

I don't want to buy a case for any other camera, I just want a separate camera.  

going to water parks, not snorkel or scuba diving.  Shallow. 

Rechargeable battery, I dont give a shit how many megapixels it has, just that it is waterproof pretty much.  

not looking to spend a fortune, less than $200 at least.  

I'm looking at amazon and I don't know which reviews to trust, but I do trust you guys and your opinions.
