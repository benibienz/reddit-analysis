I just finished doing my monthlys, which was statues and trolls for me. I also collected my monthly sweepstakes ticket right before reset, but I'm not worried about that. I had 10 minutes left to spare after getting done with trolls, so i waited, did a few things because I don't like to stand around and do nothing (gotta gain that exp). 

Reset came along, so I lobbied like usual, logged back in and did another divine box trap just so I knew that reset had occured. I went and did trolls, didn't get an exp book which I thought was kind of odd. So I logged out completely and re-logged back in. Just for safe measure before doing trolls again, I took a stroll to my statue, and it had also not reset.

My main issue is, I don't know if I glitched the system or if there is suppose to be a time frame that I have to wait before reset.

My question is, are these hidden gems being activated, the gems that we will carry for the rest of all of the slayer challenges that we get or am I just hallucinating when trying to fight raxxi on 0 enrage and I struggle with it, when I never struggle with him/her on 0 enrage. 

I died on the first attempt, my own fault that I didn't see the mirrorback spider, but the next attempt required me to pull food out of my yak just to survive through phase 3, which never happens.

Are these gems permanent and do we get anything for completing 10 of these challenges?

Some are small, some are not, but I figured that I would throw them out there anyways.

* Don't you hate it when your yak dies in the middle of a boss fight full of food or drops that you had recieved? I believe it would be nice if we were given the option to use 2 winter storage scrolls per item to have the yak send everything back to the bank before he dies. Would be a nice perk to have.

* Forget to recharge your prayer points in the middle of a boss fight? Wouldn't it be nice for your prayer icon to dim down a little bit as your prayer drained? I think that would be a nice feature.

* For those that have the rainbow beam for your loot drops, I'm sure that you have had drops a few times that was hard to see because the loot beam was facing such a way that it looked like a line. Wouldn't it be nice to have that beam spin around, to make it easier to see? The same for other beams as well.

* Can we get a change to the way the twin furies appear on the adventurers log? It's annoying for it to get filled up with nonsence about killing each individual twin.

* Worlds 54 and 40 should be combined to one world for duel arena. I went to the friendly world, and it was dead, so I went to world two. There should be one world for duel arena, while making the other a 2600-2700 total world.

* Can we get the option to modify an enhancer that we get to something else for the cost of 10% charge? So if I wanted a livid farm enhancer, but have a chompy bird enhancer that I don't plan on using, I could turn that chompy bird enhancer into a livid farm enhancer.

* This idea has been put out there quite a few times, but can we get the option to change ge offers while they are in the ge?

* Put invention workbench in Max Guild. This one is pretty straight forward.

* Finish up a task that you just hated or loved? Now you want to put that task on your permanant cancel or preferred list, but can't now because you finished the task? It would be nice to have a way to add completed tasks to the prefer/hated lists after completion, and at a 30 point discount since we cannot extend or cancel a task that's already done.

These are some of my ideas, I hope you all like them! Comment below if something seems out of place or if you have any ideas!

1. Get rid of the friends broadcasts for anima core items.

3. Fix the adventurers log when killing the twin furies to ""I have killed the twin furies 'x' amount of times."" instead of it telling you which of the two twins you killed each time.

Bosses that can be soloed but have multiple other minions, like GWD, wouldn't have this option.

as you can see above, i got all of this fluid from a good friend, the top rows have 6mg nic, the second row has 3mg nic, the third row has 18mg nic, and the last row has 0 mg nic. 

my question, is that i don't vape 0mg nic, and i want to buy some straight nicotine for them. what do i need to know in order to mix the correct values in and will it affect anything if the fluid is already premade? 

If i don't respond right away, i'm probably at work. I'm not ignoring anyone, just busy at the moment lol.

Thanks in advance for the help!

edit: I guess i should add that i currently vape 18mg nic on an atlantis v1 with a istick 50w. i vape high nic due to the fluid lasting me longer. i'm looking to increase the 0mg nics to around 6-12mg and i'm unsure how to do that. I've always just bought premade fluid and have been done and happy with it, but now i get to experiment with this option and i have no clue as to what to do. not really looking for downvotes, as i am genuinely interested in trying this for myself.",DIY_eJuice,"Need a bit of help, Got a ton of fluid from a friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY_eJuice/comments/4346si/need_a_bit_of_help_got_a_ton_of_fluid_from_a/

The fluid i have, has vg values of ~70/30 and/or higher. I currently vape 18mg nic with a 50/50 vg. I use the aspire nautilus v1 with an istick 50w and i keep it at a constant 30w all of the time. I can go a lot lower nic if i need to, but the only reason i vape a high nic is to reduce the amount of fluid i use. I've tried 6mg nic and i went through a 30mg bottle in 2 days, but at 18mg nic, i go though the same size bottle in a week.
