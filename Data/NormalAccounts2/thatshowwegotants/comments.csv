3,"You are correct, that is a picture of Paul Bernardo (post arrest).

Here is one of him pre arrest : http://www.nndb.com/people/506/000026428/bernardo3-sized.jpg

What is your point?",2015-07-15 09:46:07+00:00,ct3zjp7,4,t1_ct3vz1p,13094,serialkillers
4,"This was my first (and second) ever reddit post. As far as I know /r/serialkillers, /r/creepyencounters and /r/letsnotmeet are the best places, though after spending some time on here /r/letsnotmeet is more geared towards stories about stalking.

Personally I don't think it can be too long, as long as you have the info to fill it with. You can put TL;DR(which stands for Too Long Didn't Read, in case you are like me and didn't know before) at the bottom with a one or two sentence summary at the bottom. 

If you want someone to proof read it before you post it, I would be happy to take a look!

5,"PS - Just found at least 10 articles where he is described as blond, blue-eyed, tall, athletic, intelligent, charming ,charismatic and classically handsome.

9,"Karla made me feel sick, I know I had to pause it a few times which was a very strange feeling since I'm usually pretty immune to the worst of the worst when it comes to stuff like that.

I fill with rage when I think about her out there, married with kids, living the dream.

I had a hard time getting into OITNB because I kept seeing Laura Prepton as Karla.",2015-07-14 21:18:52+00:00,ct3ejnq,2,t1_ct2lnil,59302,LetsNotMeet
10,"I completely disagree with you that there are no such things as dead eyes. Though irrelevant because I only described him the way she did, it's proven people remember things differently over time. 26 years is a long time especially with constant media coverage. It's she remembered him that way because of the way they portrayed him (You called them Ken and Barbie yourself, which most people picture as perfect plastic and blonde). 

To be clear, I never said he was sizing her up. It was just an encounter she had with him that I thought other people on here might find interesting.

He was also raping women prior to meeting Karla and didn't begin the murders until almost a full year past my mother's encounter.

It's not something she likes to talk about, my mother is a strong woman and the look on her face and the way her demeanor changes when she does talk about it leaves no doubt in my mind she met a monster that day.",2015-07-14 21:15:18+00:00,ct3eelp,2,t1_ct2pb21,48725,serialkillers

18,"Thank you, I'm glad she was too. I shudder to think what may have happened if she hadn't been with my sister and I. She always did, and still does look younger than her age. He mostly targeted young women and teens, and had an obsession with virgins. Seeing her as a mother probably saved her life.",2015-07-13 12:59:02+00:00,ct1ng1f,2,t1_ct0rc91,74302,serialkillers
