My boyfriend recently showed me a post by a man who's mother had survived an attack by Ted Bundy, knowing about my fascination with serial killers and suggested I tell my mothers story her brush with a serial killer.

Pre-apology for formatting errors or faux pas, this is my first ever reddit post. Late June - Early August 1989 - Scarborough, Ontario (She doesn't remember the exact date but remembers it was shortly before my first birthday, though the exact date isn't important.)

My mother was a stay-at home Mom, 23 who also ran a small daycare service from our home. My father worked two jobs, but money was tight and our neighborhood was becoming increasingly dangerous with muggings and gang activity so my Mom decided to try and find an overnight job she could work the nights my dad didn't in order to save money to buy a house in a safer neighborhood.

Money being tight, and not being able to afford a babysitter, my aunt who worked in an office building only a few blocks from the job interview my Mom was to attend, agreed to watch my sister (then 4) and myself (then almost a year).

My mother dropped us off with my Aunt and headed to the interview. She arrived earlier than she thought she would so she decided to stop in the lobby and have a cigarette to calm her nerves (yes, it was 1989 people smoked everywhere). A tall, blonde man approached her with a movie star smile and asked for a light. Being polite she handed over her match book, this man was handsome and well dressed but something about him made her feel uneasy. He told her she had beautiful eyes, being a married woman with small children that was enough to make her uncomfortable. She mumbled she had to go, and hurried away to her interview. After the interview as she was heading down the street, she felt someone staring but when she turned she saw no one. She came and retrieved my sister and I from our Aunt's office and headed to the bus stop. It seemed as if out of nowhere a man appeared before her with a "" I found you!"". She turned her head to see the same man, his face leaning in towards her. In his hand, the matches she had not even realized she had left with him. He leaned closer towards me, my mother was wearing me on her chest and my sister was holding her hand. He told her I was a little angel, then looked at my sister and told her we both were. He grabbed her hand and pushed the matches into her palm, and grinned one last time and said ""I hope to see you soon"". She said it made her skin crawl, something about that perfectly plastic white smile with dead eyes. When she got home, she called my aunt and they chocked it up to being on high alert. The Scarborough Rapist had already attacked 14 girls/women and they were constantly being reminded to be on alert by the media and even posters on the streets. After all he hadn't really done anything too suspicious.

Skip ahead to February 17 1993. Paul Bernardo is arrested for the murders of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French in addition to various other suspected crimes. When my mother see's his photo, she immediately freezes and realizes that the man with the matches 4 years ago was Paul Bernardo. She was terrified and relieved all at once. She called my dad immediately at work, and when he came home that night she told him in the pit of her stomach she knew that he was also the Scarborough Rapist.

Skip ahead to Late April 1994 My mother receives a summons for jury duty. She fills out the Questionnaire and returns it within the 5 days asked of her. Hoping the information she has provided has somehow disqualified her, since she is running a small daycare from home as well as taking care of my sisters and I. (My younger sister was born in mid-1990). Much to her frustration she was summoned to be on a jury panel. She sat through the jury panel and was assigned a jury to serve on: Paul Bernardo's case. Obviously terrified and physically sick she was able to convince a court officer that with her home business, three children and the fact that she was still recovering from a recent hysterectomy meant there was no way she could serve.

We moved to a city outside of the GTA and I honestly didn't know about any of this until I got a true crime book when I was about 13 that had a chapter on Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka in it. I asked my parents if they knew anything about it because I knew based on the dates we had lived in Scarborough then.
I have asked her about it again as an adult and it's just as terrifying. We talked about it recently after she sent me an article on Facebook announcing he was applying for early day-parole, which is when I told my boyfriend the whole story. Serial Killers and the other morbid things that fascinate me are not something I discuss with him often because he's a scaredy cat and not a horror fan. I'm sure that my mother and I aren't alone in hoping that Paul Bernardo never gets parole and eventually dies behind bars.

TL;DR - Creepy man with plastic smile approaches my mom twice in one day, calls me and my sister angels. Turns out to be Scarborough Rapist and murderer Paul Bernardo.",LetsNotMeet,My mother's brush with a serial killer (xpost from /r/serialkillers,http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/3d4a7h/my_mothers_brush_with_a_serial_killer_xpost_from/
