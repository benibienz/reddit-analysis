36,"&gt; I think the sudden moment of insight, kensho, is the realisation that we are not born free, but have to actually go out and attain it through liberation for ourselves.

You still run into a problem here. Without having free will from jump, having a ""sudden moment of insight"" still becomes a matter of some favorable chance (birth or otherwise); not everyone in this setup has the same chance of finding, or even perusing, liberation.

I know liberation means to set free, there is no need to be patronizing. But without free will existing in at least some measure in all of us, we cannot ""shake ourselves free"" as there would be no will for ""ourselves"" to use.

Is demonstrably false as there is no scientific evidence (in fact much the opposite) that supports astrology but much does exist for meditation (though I will admit it is still understudied but it is still far from a ""superstition"").

I also respectfully disagree with this assertion:

&gt; we are born without freewill

Where I do agree that we rarely assert that free will, without it it would, by definition, be impossible to *choose* to peruse enlightenment; the pursuit enlightenment would be a product of a favorable birth or some other similar thing. Not to mention without free will this:

&gt; liberation from emotional subconscious control, shaking ourselves free, and then living a natural life in the sunlit uplands of Zen.

Is not possible as liberation, again by definition, requires some degree of free will.

39,"There is a fair amount of anecdotal evidence that suggests that, improperly trained, mindfulness meditation can result in a severe existential crisis.

In most religions that utilize it, it is a tool to destroy your sense of self as a path to discovery. The idea being you will begin to realize your thoughts are not actually ""yours"" and all you can do is weather them (a side affect of this being you do gain benefits of concentration etc). Those religions tend to have some teaching that guides the ""user"" to an understanding and acceptance of the feelings that arise as a result of this. Without those teachings, or an equivalent secular substitute (of which some exist often branching from psychology), you can put yourself at risk. The way I see it, using meditation for external mental benefits is much like taking antihistamines for sleep off label; it'll get the job done but you should always proceed with caution.

Given that most kids probably wont take it seriously (not to mention, depending on age, will not have a fully developed sense of self) I would *guess* that they're at a reduced risk than a grown adult groping in the dark.",2016-08-23 18:35:13+00:00,d6tl1e3,3.0,t1_d6tb4sc,12312.0,Meditation

66,"Ok, well I was gambling that this would be a logical discussion but you seem to have taken a sharp left into crazy town. So I'm going to start with this:

If you are hearing voices I beg you to see a professional. There is no situation, religious or not, where hearing voices that are not there is sane or safe. That can go from pleasant to nightmarish in no time flat.

But on topic: Even if ""god"" is truly feeding you information you have stated that the world is an illusion. If this is the case, as I have deduced previously, this standpoint means you, by default, cannot trust **anything** (and I mean **anything**) including the information your ""god"" is feeding you. Therefore from your premise:

&gt; The universe is an illusion.

You simply **cannot** draw the conclusion:

&gt; that through god, I eventually will be able to find out who is real or not.

The endpoint being you either need to conceded that your god, along with everything else in the universe, cannot be confirmed real or not real (which we have stated previously is an absolute pointless dead end) or you need to concede that the world is not an illusion in which case your assertion that suffering does not exist is demonstrably false.

91,"I wouldn't think so, although I could be wrong. Feelings are more or less just specialized thoughts. You can train your mind to have a harder time entering into a ""negative"" state, such as anger or sadness. My religions professor in undergraduate called this practicing calm mind. Fully, however, you cannot control whether or not you actually enter those states. What you can control is the action you take when those thoughts arise.

How I actually deal with them is very poorly. :-P Usually it involves one too many trips to the nearest doughnut shop. After such an impressive sadness or anger, however, I do look back as reflect on how brief and fleeting it was, despite how powerful it felt. For myself this has allowed me to calm myself sooner than in my past and in turn makes the episodes even shorter!

As an example: I remember when the Missus and I started dating I would always freak out whenever she would get angry with me because I had just left a bad relationship. I would think she was going to leave because she usually needed an hour or two to calm down before talking. Being able to reflect on the brevity of her anger allows me now to recognize that feeling of panic and calm it sooner.

95,"I apologize for the novel in advance. Let me try explaining it in a scientific light, as logic has the strongest form for me.

The ""self"" defined psychologically is the view you have of your existence. Because you can never statically define the self as one set of characteristics it is not a huge leap to say it isn't really there. Let me break that down by scientific field:

* Physics/Chemistry: You cannot use atoms/molecules to define your self because they are constantly cycling in and out of your body. There is a common paradox associated with this (funny enough on r/askreddit right now) called the Ship of Theseus that is solved simply by realizing that definitions are in their very essence arbitrary and therefore have little bearing on reality.
* Biology: Similar to the above, cells get recycled so you cannot say, ""this collection of cells is [insert name here]""
* Psychology: this is a bit trickier. Many could, and do, say something along the lines of, ""this collection of thought patterns is me."" However the fundamental action of thought, the firing of a neuron, is a variable and plastic action. Every single photon/sound-wave/smell/tactile sensation you analyze changes the way you think. even if it is just to strengthen existing connections. Think of it this way, if this were not true; if the ""wiring"" of your brain were static and unchanging, addicts would not need to seek more and more substance to achieve equivalent highs. It would be the same as the first time every time.
* Sociologically: I feel this goes without saying but, your place in society is ever changing shifting up and down with each day so you cannot define your self on you place in society.


Having this understanding of the arbitrary nature of the self gives us a basis to remove the root of our issues: attachment. This is where I think your getting hung up. For an inaccurate analogy, if attachment is the root of suffering, the ego is the bulb (like an onion bulb).

As an example I'll use your scientist (as I am conveniently both a scientist and a Buddhist.:-)). I can feel passion for my job without getting attached to said passion. As long as I remain mindful of my feelings and don't form any expectations based on them I will not become attached. As an alternate way of thinking about this, it may be helpful to understand that you cannot stop feeling as you have 0 control over the arising of your thoughts. With those feelings you have 3 options: You can hate when they arrive and be miserable whenever they do. You can love when they arrive and be miserable whenever they leave. Or you can recognize when they arrive, view them from a conscious place, understand that you have no control over their permanence, and use them to benefit you and those around you while they're there. In the scientist example, when passion for my work arises I can say , ""I feel passion for my job today, I will use this to be very productive.""

A negative feeling is much harder to deal with as evolutionary pressures have made ""bad"" much more motivating then ""good"". However it can be approached in a similar manner. When you understand that you don't have a lick of control over your feelings or their permanence you can begin dismantling them. When you enter into a strong depression the knee-jerk is to expect you are going to feel this way forever and in an absolute worst case scenario (**Please for the love of all that is holy get help if you ever feel this way**) feel you need to permanently end your feelings. This comes from creating expectations on an inherently and deeply flawed way of thinking that evolution has produced because it was always ""good enough"". If you can learn to stop yourself from forming those expectations based on feeling through practicing meditation you can begin to dull the overwhelming sense of hopelessness that is a direct result. This of course is where the difficulty lies as it takes countless years to even put at dent in it but it can, and does, happen.

Please correct any inaccuracies. Sorry again for the length but I hope it helps.:-)

129,"Firstly, I'd like to thank you for sharing your story and say that I am deeply saddened to hear that that happened to you. I know that is not an easy thing to share especially with a perfect stranger. Secondly, I'm going to suggest that, if you have not already, contact a therapist. No one here will ever be able to come as close to a professional when it comes to dealing with things like what you have briefly described. If you haven't and are worried about pill pushing you can make sure you're seeing a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist as the former cannot prescribe pills.

I'd also like to share my story. I was in an attempted carjacking about two months ago. I'll spare the intimate details; suffice to say six guys ganged up on me and kicked the living shit out of me. It was the first time I had ever been in a situation even close to that and it shook me up really hard. Couldn't leave my house for a month without carrying a knife and was even jumping at a friend I worked with because he resembled one of the assailants.

So that's where I'm coming from. It is actually a big catalyst for what launched me back into a more rigorous practice. When I began, I simply began with Anapanasati meditations and and gradually the persistent fear and anger began to fade. Eventually I got through an entire Metta meditation centered on my attackers and I feel that is what truly allowed me to let go (of the fear and anger at least. I'm still dealing with the resentment). So when dealing with the fear/anger the only insight I can provide is that it takes time and, given that my symptoms were mild, for you it may take a long time.

As far as the flashbacks, I'm not sure I can help too much there. For me it was more hateful thoughts and nightmares that were not ""memories"" of the incident. In addition, being trained as a foster parent, I often hesitate in giving information on how to deal with sexual issues in cases that I don't have deeper knowledge on. Here I will give it an attempt though. From what little I know, Zen has a focus on focusing on nothing. It might be beneficial to you to try a meditation that is more mentally ""active"" so to speak. Perhaps do a mantra based meditation. I've often found even repeating a phrase in English (something like on my in breath say, ""I am here"" while focusing on my body/breath/pulse/etc and then on the out breath say, ""in the present"" while focusing on the things around me) helps tame my mind on more ""busy"" days. You could also try something like a mandala meditation. I know there are a lot of ""adult coloring books"" that have mandalas in them. You could even use such a meditation to reflect on impermanence by burning or shredding (in an appropriate venue of course) the finished product. Perhaps starting ""busier"" like this you could slowly gain control of how to passively view these flashbacks and hidden memories and work your way back to abiding on nothingness.

138,"From reading through the comments, I feel it is not so much the direction of your thinking towards OP but your attitude. Firstly, you have a propensity for using capital letters:

&gt; Buddha did NOT TEACH any ""Mindfulness in Cake"".

Giving you the benefit of the doubt I will believe that this was to stress the point but **bold** would have sufficed without giving everyone the impression of you yelling at OP. Even I, who was giving you the benefit, couldn't help but reading the rest of your comment (and any other with all caps) as screaming in my head.

Secondly, there's this

&gt;May I know which of the 4 frames of reference you were mindful of? Were you mindful of 3 marks of existence? What exactly were you mindful of ...?

Which sounds like a rhetorical question that you don't care about the answer; one that you only asked to belittle OP. Even if this is not the case that is how it will read to most, whether or not you meant it to or not.

If you believe that OP is going down the wrong path that is fine, but there are better, more skillful ways of telling him not to focus on the brief situational mindfulness and to dive into deeper understanding of mindfulness. Are you being mindful about how you are saying things as well as what you are saying?",2016-02-13 16:57:32+00:00,czyl2ea,3.0,t1_czygod3,8852.0,Buddhism

142,"&gt; I think many people of religion miss the forest for the tree. Dogma, tradition, and obedience become the object of focus rather than the core message

I actually had a religions professor in undergrad that taught that every religion had two levels. There was the philosophical level at which the core message was understood, studied, and taught. And there was the religious level where the laymen existed where the ritual, tradition, and dogma were born out of the area's existing culture and did not necessarily even consider the central religious message all the while using its symbols and figures.",2016-02-03 21:50:55+00:00,czmse41,2.0,t1_czmj4yu,12046.0,Buddhism

147,"I've had some pretty wicked panic attacks in the past; sounds a bit like what you're describing.

I've always (inaccurately) thought of a panic attack as a seizure of the emotions. Sometimes, people with mild seizures can continue doing things normally and barely notice them. Those with grand mal seizures, obviously, couldn't do any activity in the midst of a seizure. 

The same, I feel, goes with meditation and panic attacks. The very nature of a panic attack suggests that entering a mindful state would be near impossible. I've had some mild Panic Attacks that I was able to meditate through and some sever ones that I was not. If I had any suggestion for you I would say: though meditation *during* an attack didn't work (and I would suggest not trying that again if you haven't already come to that conclusion) taking some time to calm down and then reflecting on the event may provide you with some insight on how to move past them. But I would exercise caution, if you feel that reflection is stirring up the conditions that led to the attack in the first place it might be a wiser decision to try a more neutral meditation such as Anapanasati.

Hope this can provide you with some help.",2016-01-23 20:04:54+00:00,cz98kl9,1.0,t3_427v40,79134.0,Buddhism

157,"Firstly, I feel that the question is a non-issue but that is just me. Having the answer one way or another I feel wouldn't have any baring on the cessation of suffering.

That being said I feel that the answer is yes we can assume ""our assumptions that there are objective entities behind properties"" is correct. Why? Evolution. The primate that correctly groups the input properties of a tiger to give it the proper view of the world will survive over the one who incorrectly groups it into something nonthreatening and subsequently gets eaten. Sure our emotions will have a bearing on how we ""feel"" about the grouping of traits we now call a tiger and may change the ""finer"" perception of what a tiger is (ie someone who is afraid of tigers vs. Steve Erwin) the tiger non-the-less is still physically there.",2016-01-18 01:49:54+00:00,cz27dbn,5.0,t1_cz26yln,708.0,Buddhism

163,"Honestly, as a Buddhist and a scientist I try to explain things to myself on a physical level. Take karma for instance. I need not invoke rebirth (though I do believe in reincarnation as my own ""guilty pleasure"") to see that it works. 

For example: lets say Jon gives Stan some purposeful bad dating advice because Jon likes Stan's girlfriend. Stan will fall flat on his face and look like a fool. Jon's karma is that Stan will no longer trust Jon's advice, whittling away at an otherwise happy friendship.

As far as the many realms and devas I accept neither as physical things but more as psychological constructs.

That being said the only thing that is left unexplained is rebirth. Frankly I see no reason that you cannot practice without accepting rebirth. The only reason it is even in the practice is due to the place of the Buddha's birth If there is nothing appealing to your common sense or to evidence that these ""things"" that are in the practice are real discard them. If you find later that they have that evidence through your practice then accept them. To me the core of Buddhism (esp. Lay practice) is always the 4 noble truths and the Eight fold path.
