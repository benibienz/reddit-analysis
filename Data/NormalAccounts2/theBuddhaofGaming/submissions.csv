Windows Defender couldn't get rid of it, malewarebytes couldn't find it. Downloaded a few different AV's to try and find it and I think that I may have deleted a registry key for log on as the following symptoms resulted:

System will boot to page before log on screen (still with my custom image). I can access the log in screen with extra weirdness; the network symbol shows a disconnected hard line despite active and working wifi, ease of access won't respond, power button shows only shut down. Upon login attempt after entering password the cursor goes to the beginning (like I hit home) and eventually locks back to the screen before the login screen. Clicking again sometimes brings me back to my login sometimes to ""user"" where it asks for a username and password that I have no clue what it is.

Solution attempts: multiple restarts and download windows 10 media via other computer. Windows 10 media got me to computer repair interface but upon attempt of reset stalls at 1 percent and displays a failure statement and that nothing has changed.

Side notes: upgraded from 7 to 10 less than a week ago. Has a recovery partition but either I cannot access it or the upgrade wiped it somehow as it is showing as blank. If at all possible I'd rather not get rid of my personal files as they include dissertation research.
