I made it around two years ago when season two was coming out, so it was based on *Providence* base, but only loosely, because the main idea behind it was just my imagination - what should the base contain in a roughly plausible format.  
  
However, looking back on it now, its similarities with the current base *The Playground* are quite striking, possibly because the same set was used from *Providence* to the *The Playground* on the show, and also that I borrowed bits of it. Anyway I dug through my files because someone mentioned this kind of thing in a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/4p723a/how_big_is_the_playground/), you should note that when it comes to size this is a bit iffy because the plane is in the hangar there and in the show, the plane can fit several rooms.  
  
Also the inclusion of the hacker room looks kinda weird, that's because it was tailored to fit [this image](http://i.imgur.com/5AOgEjo.jpg) I made (for the life of me I cannot figure out why).  
One final thing, in that image, of the monitor screens is displaying [this image](http://i.imgur.com/5DjWreO.jpg) - that's an amalgamation of a few shots from the show to create what I imagined at the time would be the view from the front door (of *Providence*).  
  
Anyway, thought you guys would appreciate this kind of thing.",2016-06-23 21:55:03+00:00,d4le8i2,1.0,t3_4pj85g,862.0,shield

249,"Hi - it makes me really glad to know that this might help.  
  
We, as humans, are basically **programmed** not to like ourselves. We **search out** and **emphasise** our flaws in our self-hatred. We hold ourselves up to unrealistic standards and **loathe** ourselves for not meeting them. Basically, it's because we're designed to make connections with **other** people (for self-gain) and therefore not ourselves.  
  
But there's no reason why in our modern day and age we shouldn't grow to like **ourselves** too. Sure it may seem unrealistic **now**, an **ideal** that we feel we don't deserve and won't achieve, and since we don't know how to reach there, it seems better not to start.  
  
But when we're **sat still on the ground,** unable to move because we're stuck in our sea of problems, this video (the best I've ever seen on the subject) gives us the **first push** that we all need. You'll notice that a time period of 21 days is recommended - the reason given is that that's the time it'll take to ""**change our mindset**.""  
  
That's actually all this method is, a way to make us **alter how we view things,** i.e. ourselves. You might have realised this from the reasoning behind each step: the suggestion of **Journaling** is for self-focus, to chronicle what's actually been happening for you, instead of believing, as so many so, that 'nothing is happening in their lives;' the **3 Gratitudes**, to change our perspective to what has occurred **in our favor,** rather than focus on the sorrow or issues that usually dominate; **Meditation** to relax and allow self-satisfaction, plus just a little freedom to think about **what we want,** rather than **what life forces us to**; **Excercise,** for gratification and a reminder that **achievement** can come always from **hard work**; and **Random Acts of Kindness,** to remind yourself that **you are a good person.** These are all just showing you **your own qualities,** when you really examine it. What that ultimately means, of course, is that the good that we'll perceive in ourselves after those 21 days, was actually there **from the start.** We just **couldn't see it for ourself.**  
  
So yes, what I've proposed as a method might just seem like any other fake 'wonder-cure,' something that'll make bold promises and seem good at first, but quickly prove to be bothersome or inadequate. But it's **simple** and **clear** in how it works. And it will provide the first support to aid change, and, if you **stick with it,** after the 21 days or whatever time period you choose, you **won't need** any crutches to lean on any more, not  the pets, TV or music recommended in the rest of this thread, or ^dare ^I ^say ^it pills. As long as you let it **help you up** and **don't push it away**, you'll eventually be able to **stand for yourself.** And then that will turn into a **walk**, and then a **run* and you'll **never have to rely on anything ever again.**
  
You just need to give it a **chance,** and remember, at the end of it all, that you're still you. With the same qualities, likes and dislikes, quirks and passions. But you've **gotten into the habit** of seeing yourself, just that **little bit more kindly**. And that will have made all the difference.",2016-06-07 23:04:34+00:00,d4044dj,,t1_d400sst,4812.0,AskReddit

255,"Yes it's nice but there's no sense of development through the video. The cuts are all consistent but EXACTLY THE SAME for each measure. What you need to do is either:  
  
* Vary the pacing (shorter or longer cuts)  
* Consider brightness, for example you used 3 'bright' clips at the beginning (Thor) but intercut them with a 'dark' iron man clip so ruined that mood  
* Try and draw some parallels between clips and place those ones near each other. That can either be by what is happening in the clip or, as mentioned, what the clip looks like. I noticed ONE instance of this, namely the three *Thor* character sitting, then cut to the *Winter Soldier* crew walking, but the rest just seemed randomly placed  
* Choose order of clips by what's being described by the lyrics of the song. This doesn't have to be religiously followed, so just if they're talking about '*dawns*' then stick on some morning scenes, but it maintains the viewer's interest

354,"After playing many many times, I've come to the same conclusion - mass *must* be lost when someone dies, or the total mass in play at any time would forever increase due to  
  
1. Random spawning of food across the map (it's not just when you boost they appear, sometimes they appear randomly)  
2. New player spawning. Each player starts with 10 mass, where does that come from?  
  
Boosting is definitely a 100% conversion rate, you can test this by boosting then eating your own mass - you will grow to the same length *or* if you are like of mass 15 and you boost into someone else's trail left by them boosting so as you go you eat theirs, you will continually boost, the mass you gain will be the same as you lose.  
  
Therefore the only mass lost can be from dying.  
It makes sense after all, otherwise the largest guys will always be in the same place, and as soon as one number #1 dies, someone will immediately take his place, which is unfair to the little guys.  
  
On the other hand about your point of ringing - I actually think its a necessity to *let them eat it first* because trying to be selfish and take all the mass yourself first is a good way to allow your competition to start trying to kill you, and also you miss out on half the stuff that they eat.",2016-05-31 11:33:48+00:00,d3q9b0z,3.0,t1_d3psrra,38136.0,Slitherio

455,"Seconding that, the actual boring reason is due to the original placements round the table:  
  
* Britta and Abed, as in the pilot she knew him first and brought him to the study group, who then brought everyone else. Also in that first scene with just the three of them it would be weird for them not to be near each other  
* Troy and Pierce were supposed to bond through mutual adolescence  
* Shirley and Annie, in the storyline, arrived when Jeff was out of the room. Thus seeing his jacket on the chair, given that they arrived together, they were unlikely to sit separately  
* Shirley had to be next to Pierce, for sexual harassment comedy which gives us the following lucky coincidences:  
1. Troy and Abed became best friends after the actors' friendship developed  
2. Shirley and Annie get those 'Awww' shots  
3. Jeff and Annie  
  
This leaves Jeff on his own, without a pairing, hence the empty chair. The writers were okay with that, because the fact Jeff gets a whole side to himself shows his dominance to the table, supporting Pierce's theory that it's all about the chair (referenced in *Environmental Science* and *A Fistful of Paintballs*.

572,"For reference:  
  
&gt; **3) Fidelity to the NHS**  

&gt; The parties have agreed that where a doctor intends to undertake hours of paid work as a locum, additional to the hours set out in the work schedule, the doctor must offer such additional hours of work exclusively to the service of the NHS via an NHS staff bank. The requirement to offer such service is for work commensurate with the grade and competencies of the doctor, though the doctor may choose to accept work at a lower grade, if they wish. The doctor can carry out additional activity over and above the standard commitment
set out in the doctor’s work schedule up to a maximum average of 48 hours per week (or up to 56 hours per week if the doctor has opted out of the Working Time Regulations). The employer will agree with the LNC local processes for the doctor to inform their employer of their intention to carry out such work. This provision does not prevent paid work for non-locum activities outside the NHS. Rates of payment for such work have been improved so that the doctor would receive a 22% premium above the prevailing hourly rate.  
  
That is actually going to annoy a huge number of people. On the other hand it may well end the perception of taking up a locum job as 'the easy way out' filled with high pay and no responsibility.",2016-05-18 16:42:01+00:00,d3aeips,2.0,t1_d3ae56o,475.0,ukpolitics

643,"Allowing the use of tagging on a networking site such as *facebook* or *reddit*:  
  
1. It inevitably leads to **tag a mate** type posts in which low-effort poor-content posts are promoted highly and have high viewership. This in turn specifically rewards those pages who resort to such posts, leading to in general, a lower standard quality of content on your networking site.  
  
2. It increases spam, specifically the number of **new** comments per second, which thus reduces the visibility of comments actually attempting to contribute to the discussion. Imagine if we clicked on the **new** tab on any frontpage post and found only a bunch of users tagging each over. It would mean only people arriving early at a post get visibility (and therefore upvotes and therefore comment karma).  
  
3. If the system exclusively rewards those who arrive early, there will be a great deal of **spam** as people rush to say absolutely anything they can on posts which they see. Examples of this are the incessant **copypasta** comments that litter *Unilad* and the *LadBible*, all in an attempt to get early likes, or the usual comment of **First** on YouTube videos.  
  
4. People begin interacting **only with their friends** on posts, and not with strangers (as they currently do on reddit, indeed as I am doing with you now), leading to a less diverse and lower quality of discussion.  
  
5. People no longer judge each post by themselves and what they are interested in when browsing, i.e. what catches their own personal eye and how they can contribute to the discussion. In general there are less individual opinions and more hive-mind **collective** kind of comments. If there's one thing reddit hates itself for, its the idea of collective opinions and **circle-jerking**. Following your friends to posts rather than finding them yourselfs would increase this.

Because I'm in that kind of mood, I'm going to say **[S3E20.5] Civil War**, written by Dan Harmon and directed by (surprise surprise) Joe and Anthony Russo. Summary:  
  
&gt; Dean throws an unexpected paintball game to celebrate his return to the school, funded by the gratitude of Carl and Richie. In actual fact the game is a cover used by the Dean to send Jeff (promising to hire him as a lawyer in the upcoming trial), Shirley and Pierce (promising to give them a sandwich shop) to search for Chang, who is rumoured to still be in the school following his escapades as dictator.  
  
&gt; As the paintball game commences though, Chang secretly approaches Annie and Britta and beg them/win their sympathy to help him escape prosecution, suggesting his latest ploy was an attempt to gain power and win back the affection of his wife, while trying to feel important for once, since the study group mostly ignore him. Abed joins #TeamChang, on account of him being able to empathise with having to turn to drama in order to express his feelings.  
  
&gt; The group convene in the study room (without Chang and the Dean), assuming they'd be an alliance as always, but someone (Leonard) bursts in on them and reveals Chang has been sighted and the whole school knows. At this point the Dean announces on the intercom instead of last man standing, the first man to take out Chang will win the reward.  
  
&gt; A heated debate brews in in the study room, with each of #TeamDean and #TeamChang arguing but not revealing their ulterior motives. Jeff suggests they all furiously pursue Chang now in order to take him out before the rest of the school, (as this is the only way to guarantee the Dean will keep his promise to him, Shirley and Pierce), Annie and Britta Chang will be harmed if the whole school is hunting him, they suggest they find him and protect him.  
  
&gt; Argument. The study group splits ways and begins a war across the room eventually fleeing through the opposing doors. Both teams begin vigorously pursuing Chang, taking out the other students along the way (for their different motives).  
  
&gt; The two teams become the only ones left I the school. Eventually Chang is found by #TeamChang and hidden in the cafeteria, cornered by #TeamDean who actually bring along the Dean. A final firefight breaks out, with all the members of the study group being taken out 1 by 1 until Jeff, Annie, Chang and the Dean remain. Annie takes out Jeff, and the Dean takes out Annie, leaving the Dean and Chang remaining as the pretensies-dead study group look on. The Dean holds Chang point blank up against a wall with a pistol and delivers a final sentence listing his wrongdoings. He intends to subdue Chang (by a pretensies-execution), then deliver he knocked out body to the police. Chang stands and confesses to his crimes, then turns himself in.  
  
&gt; The study group disband. They refuse to speak and study alone.  
  
&gt; They finally all meet again when called as witnesses in Chang's trial. In a montage, they each deliver a statement until Jeff is called to the stand. Jeff lists Chang's crimes and tells the jury how Chang's actions caused them to be expelled together from the school... and made them closer as a Study Group. He realises the actions of a madman have made Greendale what it is, and now experiencing the storm, the worst of times at Greendale, they can look forward to times of improvement for (a Harmon-led) Season 4 and a return to sanity. He reminisces on when Chang was normal and the times when he was a friend to the group (Shirley confirms) and even when he went crazy, how he still influenced the group beyond them knowing. He pleases the jury give a light sentence. Chang accepts and serves his time.  
  
That's my pitch. Someone tell me what the hell to do with Troy.

788,"Hi okay, to answer your point about why he has to kill one:  
  
He's in competition with another magician (Bale) who does a similar transportation trick. He wants to prove he's better than him, hence him trying to do the same trick, but better.  
Also, even if that were not the case, it wouldn't be very impressive regardless to clone oneself on stage - the movie makes a big deal about creating an *illusion* for the audience, who expect things like the use of doubles. So saying everyone 'Hey look I cloned myself' invites accusations that the double was there all along and no cloning took place.
Also the movie makes a big thing about the 3 states of magic:  
**1. The Pledge**: Show the audience something ordinary, such as Jackman saying he *will* teleport himself.
**2. The Turn**: Make something unexpected happen, such as Jackman disappearing.
**3. The Prestige**: Bring it back, Jackman reappears on the other side of the stage.  
  
If you, as you suggested, clone someone, you get the Pledge and the Turn, the unexpected thing being that a duplicate appears, but there's no Prestige, you're not turning it ordinary again.",2016-05-03 10:17:46+00:00,d2qu9mu,5.0,t1_d2qcl2z,37452.0,philosophy

791,"Indeed. The question is raised - are we defining people as solely the product of their memories? And if so, does that mean amnesiacs or demented people should no longer be considered people?

792,"Okay, so let's break it down.  
  
**1. Doctor Who**,  
  
A show which operates on the basis that the main character can *regenerate*. What this means is that when he dies (which he has done 13 times now), usually from fatal injury, though twice from old age, because he is of a different (alien) species, [he can simply change his face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVEY5AL5zzk), while healing all previous injury and becoming a new man (for the show, this allows them to choose a new actor). 
   
In the show it was generally perceived that regeneration *does not hurt*, the Doctor uses as we might use a shower, to periodically cleanse oneself of the misfortune that had been gathered that day (or lifetime in his case), the new face is an unfortunate side effect.  
  
But for me this changed in one particular episode which I quote above - the 10th Doctor confesses he thinks its a new man walking around who *believes* that they are him (and thus as a viewer notice no difference in behaviour, no ""what a shame I died"", post-regeneration). So this would fit with the memory thesis - he believes basically at the end of that life, he actually died, and what remains in his place is a man with all his memories.  
  
This is quite a harrowing thought and really quite upsets how we feel about the character on the show. In order so as not to upset the viewer however, the screenwriters have not spent too long on this issue, apart from that one time.  
  
**2. The Prestige**  
  
For real fans of this movie, there is some debate as to what Nolan wants us to believe for this movie. Assuming that [the machine does in fact work](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3dbd9v/the_prestige_the_machine_does_not_work_movie/), we are left to decipher exactly what happens. Basically for the unitiaed, [Jackman's character steps into Bowie's machine, which makes a duplicate of him a few meters away.](https://youtu.be/5szbIKcttu8?t=125). This gives the appearance of transportation, since the **original**, who remains where is, drops through a trapdoor below, and the duplicate runs up to the balcony.  
Throughout the course of the movie, the question is raised which one ought to survive, the first time he 'tests it out', the one who remained inside the machine shoots the one which had appeared elsewhere, ([this clip shows that, though someone has dubbed over it](https://youtu.be/fxnZLAJYZmQ?t=165)) however in all later occurrences, when he performs the trick on a stage, the one who remained inside the machine was dropped into a tank and drowned.  
  
So basically the film struggles with the issue of *sacrifice*, Jackman's character claims to Bale's that he *knows* sacrifice, on account of the fact he has to step into the machine every night (over 100 times), knowing each time, that he will drown. The one which survives, the one who appeared further away, thinks itself just luckily, that each time it 'gets' to be the one who survives, but in actual fact, its implied that they *both* have his memories, therefore *both* think they are him.  
  
Which one is the real Angier, the one who keeps his consciousness? The standard theory is the one who remains in the cage and drowns every night is. An alternate suggestion, which has more proof from the dialogue in the movie, suggests its chance, the Angier who steps in the cage could end up as either of the duplicates (cage or elsewhere). I am of the personal opinion that *neither* of them are him, the moment Angier steps into the cage, he dies, and two duplicates are created with a different conscience, both of whom share his memories to think they are him. Go figure.  
  
**3. Teleportation**  
  
Right, so let's say we had teleporters. How would these work?  
  
Well one would imagine that they would take a scan of the composition of our matter, break them down, send them through a very large distance very quickly, and reassemble them on the other side, giving the illusion of instant movement.  
  
The hitch? After the procedure is finished, we would consider it a success, since we have been assembled in the same way, all our memories are the same (obviously we wouldn't remember the journey), and therefore we believe we are the same person. Only problem - **we are not.** The reassembled body is not equivalent to the original, it does not have the same consciousness. To all intents and purposes, we died as soon as the original transporter machine was switched on, then someone, far away, who thinks they are us, walks around and declares it a success. And nobody knows any better.  
  
Is there a solution to this? Can we ever achieve instantaneous travel (and therefore time travel)? Well by use of a **wormhole**, one would suggest yes. These are simply bends in the space-time grid, if you will, connecting two spots on our plane, our dimension instantly. Passing through this would not break down our particles, the original would still be preserved.

794,"I call this the 'Doctor Who' problem - if the titular character regenerates, into a new body, is it still really him, or does it just think its him? The issue was (briefly) addressed in *The End of Time*, in which Tennant's portrayal mentioned:  
  
&gt; Even if I change it still feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.
  
which was really quite a powerful line. Basically it suggested, although the character could regenerate, heal all physical injury, the new *incarnation* was simply a new life form living on with his memories, thus Tennant's character was pretty darn right to be scared.  
  
The issue is also brought up  in *The Prestige*, is a *cloned* version, really the same? In the course of the movie, it seems the conclusion is Jackman's character simply accepts that they are not the same, after each night of his performance, he *will die*, but for the sake of the act, he has to accept that - which is what makes his performance also admirable (as well as Bale's characters), proving he too does understand sacrifice.  
  
Is there any easy solution for it? Well, **don't step into any teleporter machines**, and cross your fingers. If it does happen, we wouldn't know any better.",2016-05-02 08:51:12+00:00,d2pfsdp,1.0,t3_4hfhq7,1951.0,philosophy

For that reason you'll see lot of attempts to try and borrow (it almost comes across as stealing) ideas Dan set up in previous seasons, but little or no original content or jokes, which is a shame. What you've noticed is one such instance. As actually devoted fans, the writers knew the jukebox thing and tried to make a callback to it but really referential humour is beneath them, especially a whole episode **[S4E12]** devoted to it.

1054,"I really thought the ending was going to be awesome with Superman's death, it looked like such a ballsy move, with the implication that all that setup and themes of sacrifice actually meant something for the end, there was shock and feeling behind that death and the funeral and remembrance scenes played out like it was going to mean something.  
  
And then that last shot happened. The unnecessary dirt rising for 20 frames. And I simply just despaired, it ruined the ending for me.
  
Having said that, I quite enjoyed the pacing of the story, which I understand a lot of people have issues with, but for me it kind of felt like it was put together from the viewer's point of view, i.e. we *know* Bruce's parents are going to die, we *know* the two are at odds because of the events of *Man of Steel,* so the film moved past them fairly quickly in order to show us what we really wanted to see, the things that would surprise us and amaze us.  
Like the Doomsday fight, like the portrayal of sudo-PTSD.  
  
Didn't like the marketing of it as a VS movie, at any point during the fight it was entirely one-sided. If Superman had been hit with Batman's Kryptonite knockout gun, then Batman was vastly superior, if he hadn't, then Batman didn't stand a chance. Not a real fight, certainly too short.  
  
Otherwise I thought Snyder didn't do a bad job. Plenty of TDKR references, plenty of Miller homages. Congrats.",2016-03-31 09:46:52+00:00,d1k8nt1,1.0,t3_4bupv2,546441.0,movies

1063,"There are several checks you can put in place for any image, generally doing any of the following will help:  
  
* Zoom in on the edge of a foreground object. See if the difference between foreground and background is noticeably pixellated or unfocused or sharp. That's evidence of **post-production selection** of objects.  
* Is the (direction of) lighting identifiably different from the foreground and background? That's evidence of **lighting adjustment**.  
* Zoom in on general patches of uniformity (for people, this tends to be foreheads, cheeks, noses). If the pattern of pixels in composition is identical in places or lengthened, that's evidence of the use of a **clamp-stamp tool** or a **smudge** or **selective blurring tool.**  
* Unnaturally bright sections, generally in the background, are usually artificially enhanced. This is often evidence of post-production inserted **lens flares, sparkles** or adjustments to **lightings/levels.**  
* To see if stock footage has been inserted into the background, one can do a **simple levels** adjustment in *Adobe Photoshop* or *GIMP* in order to see original backgrounds, as was famously seen [here](http://www.watson.ch/imgdb/1a7c/Qx,B,0,0,615,410,256,170,102,68/8272882119975406)  
* Finally viewing the **metadata** for an image, as can be done [here](http://regex.info/exif.cgi) can tell you any residue xml data and whether or not an image has been saved from a popular photo-editing program.

1107,"Depends on the demographic. If you're trying trying to convert an ex-Big Bang Theory/Friends/Seinfeld watcher, the kind that Community usually appeals to, and they're prepared to bingewatch then:
2x14 Advanced Dungeons and Dragons;
1x23 Modern Warfare;
2x23 A Fistful of Paintballs;
2x24 For a Few Paintballs More;
1x1 Pilot;
1x2 ...;

Because I reckon the themed episodes are the greatest hooks for the series that really get new viewers hooked, plus because they're themed, they don't contain spoilers that really matter and it has the added effect that they'll watch through from Pilot to the end of Season 2 in order to meet up with what they've watched, thereby reaching the real gems of Season 2: Paradigms of Human Memory and Cooperative Calligraphy. Also, those ones are really hilarious and they really show off the group demographic without spoiling anything.
