Then, on a separate issue, I accidentally knocked the computer over, causing damage to the hard drive - we installed a new OS - Windows 8.1. However, the touchscreen did not work any longer.  
Now, having updated it to Windows 10 once again, only that small section of the screen works again.  
  
The only thing I can think of is to try updating the driver for 'HID-compliant touch screen' under Device Manager, and uninstalling and reinstalling that. So far, it has not had any effect.  
  
I am also not able to complete the 'Calibration' of the touchscreen, as it does not register any touches except for that small section near the bottom - thus making it impossible for me to click the arrows as specified.  
  
Can anyone help?

The waiting room was, in the best of descriptions, adequate, it fulfilled its functions, lined with unadorned seats along its undecorated walls, but it did so barely.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Technically, it was my fault, if the room was of inadequate standard, after all I owned the building and both kingdoms, yet this was my first visit since I’d leased it out to the two employees.

Many bore injuries, which I’d called a guessing game when I’d delivered them here; now as I observed them, I could only pity their sorry states. In contrast, I was clothed in a shrouding black cloak, of which the hem ran down to sweep along the floor and the hood covered my face. I was proud of my differences from the others around me, they marked me out as a symbol of status. That I had not suffered the misfortunes that had consumed these, the last of their race. It was with a mocking smile that I watched those remaining depart from the once-filled room. I self-importantly rose and strode forward when at last my name was called.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Okay, so he didn’t really know my name, the man at the desk, rather he’d simply read off my hasty scrawl from the sign-in sheet and eyed me suspiciously as I approached, noting for the first time the empty room that remained behind me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“It’s a slow call today,” he observed, his marked hands brushing the tumbling white hair from his eyes to over his white robes, “the first we’ve had in a long time. Would you know if there was some war going, perhaps, blocking the channels? Or has some miracle cure been discovered?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I grunted my affirmation to the amused expression with which he regarded me, my own thoughts were those only for his ignorance that his time was over. He habitually reached for his pen and began writing, taking down the routine details needed for my entry past the gates. 
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Name?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Death.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“With an ‘F?’”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“With a ‘T-H.’”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Occupation?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The same.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You kill people?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I do.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Another soldier then. Any titles? Surnames?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Some call me ‘Destroyer of Worlds,’ or ‘Mr. Grim,’ once even ‘King of Terrors.” 
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He finished his writing with a flourish and looked up and beamed, either unperturbed or dulled to the senses. This had been his post for over two thousand years, after all.
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""Okay, thank you. Please head on through for judgement. I guess this is goodbye from me.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“On the contrary. As a matter of fact, I’m bringing you along.”    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He barely had time for the shock to register on his face before my arm had wrapped around his neck, pulling him from his podium and squeezing the life from him. His unenthusiastic spirit dissipated form his collapsed body as I walked on forward. We would catch up soon enough.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Passing through several doors and corridors, I arrived after a short while in a small conference room and sat down in one of three chairs, opposite the other two behind a table. The room was basic, sleek grey walls, painted to look neutral and modern. In front of me stretched a sheer pain of glass, reflecting my own blank face back at me. On the left, a fiery red pattern crept across the wall from one corner surrounding a door leading off to an inky blackness, stirred in with licks of red light that flickered across the corridor like tongs of flame dancing across the surface of an oil well. On the right, blinding white light streamed from the open door, rendering what lay behind invisible. Both doors emitted a startling silence, highlighting the stillness of my breath and the motionless with which I stared directly ahead.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Footsteps approached, then the first of the two entered. He was an old man, clothed in white robes, a grey beard wistfully hanging from his chin, storm clouds in his eyes. He wasn’t important. For a while he had been worshipped after he had made an appearance among the humans an epoch ago, but now the temples to his name destroyed, wars bloomed on account of his name and the peace he had tried to broker among the humans had failed laughably. His own good will lay forsaken in his all-consuming feud with the man who had entered from the other door, who sported an expensive three-piece suit lined with the red of a lake of fire; his wild tangle of sooty hair covered the curls of his horns. As with the administrator from the gates, a certain fatigue had gripped them. They seated themselves and automatically, without a word to me, began arguing amongst themselves, brown file folders marked with my name conjured in their hands to inform them of my inevitable sins.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Okay, I think I should have this one,"" began God, his eyes furiously scanning his briefing notes   
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You had the last one.” Lucifer would not let any leave his kingdom with a fight.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He was rightly mine. He was a charity worker.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He was a retired lawyer. That means he had sinned enough for me.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He repented! How many times do we have to go over this? If I forgive them they are mine.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So you’re just forgiving anyone now? You even forgave Cain’s heresy.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Cain had good in him. I get the good ones.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Now, doesn’t that seem almighty unfair. I’m stuck with the Hitlers of this world, is that right?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Hitler is evil. Of course you got him.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I didn’t want him though. Have you heard his solutions to our overcrowding problem?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this point, I cleared my throat, loudly, causing them both to start. The three of us held a pregnant pause as they fired a piercing glare at me, then:  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Y'know what? Lucifer exclaimed gleefully, ""This one is mine. Lived an untold amount of time, never once went to church. And he's obviously impertinent if he's rushing judgement.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God considered. ""He’s a military man though. It says here he carried out his duty unwaveringly.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“His duty is to kill people. And not only that. His soul is tainted by murder, I can sense it.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“An interesting point. What does he have to say for it?” God looked up towards me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I've killed.” I put in, “Many, many times. And I’ve enjoyed it every time.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You see?” declared an excited Lucifer, “He feels no remorse or regret.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“But I had to.” I said. My expression gave away nothing, but I cocked my head to look at Lucifer.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God considered for a short while. “Why did you have to kill, my child?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Death comes for everyone.” I shrugged. “That’s our role.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lucifer’s smirk was triumphant. “He’s mine then.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God nodded his affirmation and Lucifer turned to me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“It is my solemn duty now to remove you from this unsavoury purgatory and help you find your death.” He rose from the desk. “This way, sinner, my role is to lead you on.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I remained in my seat, a cool smile growing on my face, for the first time.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Actually,” I said softly, raising my hand, “your role is finished. The end is here.”    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With a blinding flash, the glass behind them shattered inwards, a blinding black light pouring into the room as the two deities turned, to see the Planet Earth in all its sombre glory, spinning sadly upon its axis as its once-beautiful swirling swathes of green and blue were bathed in an ugly orange light. The world was almost glowing, as if signalling goodbye, its strange outlook only dwarfed in abnormality by the utter silence that coated it; the final sign that life on the planet had simply passed on. It seemed the two had never bothered to look upon their creation, preferring to squabble with each other over the judgement of humans, the produce of their lands. They gazed captivated by the changing colour of the world they’d once loved, the weight of finality bearing down on their shoulders.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God turned to me. Now he understood. Now the reverence on his face was of one who was greeting his employer, the Destroyer, the Hooded One, and upon his face were the signs of resignation, an absolute acceptance of his fate.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“How did it happen?” he said, indicating the chocked planet. “What happened to all the humans?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The kindest Death,” I replied, “genetic mutation. They poisoned themselves with their radioactive wars, not enough to kill themselves, but kill the children they’d bred and sterilize their bodies. Then their age took them one by one, until in all their numbers, their species lay lost.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God nodded.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So this is the end then?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I told him that it was so, and as if to enunciate my point, the spirit of St Peter floated past us, having burst through the door behind me, he handed in his keys to God before departing to the right. Lucifer and God watched him go, before nodding to me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The end... for us too?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Death comes for everyone.”    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So be it.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With their final breath they bowed their head and I stood up and reached across the table, laying a gentle finger on both their shoulders. Wind rushed through the room as the souls left them. Their shoulders shook as they slumped forward. The appearance of their bodies were so peaceful they might have been sleeping. As was the way with all whose path had crossed mine.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was alone, the last being left in the universe, left behind with only the dead. My work was done. As with the two whose bodies lay before me, my role was over. The end of an age had come and I remained by myself, the last enemy to be destroyed. Crossing round to the other side of the table, I stepped out to stand in front of the wreckage of the mirror, now a portrait of the dying earth. I, Death, looked out across space, the vast emptiness, the utter loneliness, to the one place which had once held Life. I found it was beautiful.

On the left, a fiery red pattern crept across the wall from one corner surrounding a door leading off to an inky blackness, stirred in with licks of red light that flickered across the corridor like tongs of flame dancing across the surface of an oil well. On the right, blinding white light streamed from the open door, rendering what lay behind invisible. Both doors emitted a startling silence, highlighting the stillness of my breath and the motionless with which I stared directly ahead.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Footsteps approached, then the first of the two entered. He was an old man, clothed in white robes, a grey beard wistfully hanging from his chin, storm clouds in his eyes. He wasn’t important. For a while he had been worshipped after he had made an appearance among the humans an epoch ago, but now the temples to his name destroyed, wars bloomed on account of his name and the peace he had tried to broker among the humans had failed laughably. His own good will lay forsaken in his all-consuming feud with the man who had entered from the other door, who sported an expensive three-piece suit lined with the red of a lake of fire; his wild tangle of sooty hair covered the curls of his horns. As with the administrator from the gates, a certain fatigue had gripped them. They seated themselves and automatically, without a word to me, began arguing amongst themselves, brown file folders marked with my name conjured in their hands to inform them of my inevitable sins.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Okay, I think I should have this one,"" began God, his eyes furiously scanning his briefing notes   
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""You had the last one.” Lucifer would not let any leave his kingdom with a fight.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He was rightly mine. He was a charity worker.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He was a retired lawyer. That means he had sinned enough for me.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“He repented! How many times do we have to go over this? If I forgive them they are mine.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So you’re just forgiving anyone now? You even forgave Cain’s heresy.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Cain had good in him. I get the good ones.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Now, doesn’t that seem almighty unfair. I’m stuck with the Hitlers of this world, is that right?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Hitler is evil. Of course you got him.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I didn’t want him though. Have you heard his solutions to our overcrowding problem?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At this point, I cleared my throat, loudly, causing them both to start. The three of us held a pregnant pause as they fired a piercing glare at me, then:  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Y'know what? Lucifer exclaimed gleefully, ""This one is mine. Lived an untold amount of time, never once went to church. And he's obviously impertinent if he's rushing judgement.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God considered. ""He’s a military man though. It says here he carried out his duty unwaveringly.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“His duty is to kill people. And not only that. His soul is tainted by murder, I can sense it.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“An interesting point. What does he have to say for it?” God looked up towards me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“I've killed.” I put in, “Many, many times. And I’ve enjoyed it every time.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“You see?” declared an excited Lucifer, “He feels no remorse or regret.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“But I had to.” I said. My expression gave away nothing, but I cocked my head to look at Lucifer.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God considered for a short while. “Why did you have to kill, my child?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Death comes for everyone.” I shrugged. “That’s our role.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Lucifer’s smirk was triumphant. “He’s mine then.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God nodded his affirmation and Lucifer turned to me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“It is my solemn duty now to remove you from this unsavoury purgatory and help you find your death.” He rose from the desk. “This way, sinner, my role is to lead you on.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I remained in my seat, a cool smile growing on my face, for the first time.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Actually,” I said softly, raising my hand, “your role is finished. The end is here.”    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With a blinding flash, the glass behind them shattered inwards, a blinding black light pouring into the room as the two deities turned, to see the Planet Earth in all its sombre glory, spinning sadly upon its axis as its once-beautiful swirling swathes of green and blue were bathed in an ugly orange light. The world was almost glowing, as if signalling goodbye, its strange outlook only dwarfed in abnormality by the utter silence that coated it; the final sign that life on the planet had simply passed on. It seemed the two had never bothered to look upon their creation, preferring to squabble with each other over the judgement of humans, the produce of their lands. They gazed captivated by the changing colour of the world they’d once loved, the weight of finality bearing down on their shoulders.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God turned to me. Now he understood. Now the reverence on his face was of one who was greeting his employer, the Destroyer, the Hooded One, and upon his face were the signs of resignation, an absolute acceptance of his fate.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“How did it happen?” he said, indicating the chocked planet. “What happened to all the humans?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The kindest Death,” I replied, “genetic mutation. They poisoned themselves with their radioactive wars, not enough to kill themselves, but kill the children they’d bred and sterilize their bodies. Then their age took them one by one, until in all their numbers, their species lay lost.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;God nodded.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So this is the end then?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I told him that it was so, and as if to enunciate my point, the spirit of St Peter floated past us, having burst through the door behind me, he handed in his keys to God before departing to the right. Lucifer and God watched him go, before nodding to me.  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“The end... for us too?”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“Death comes for everyone.”    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“So be it.”  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With their final breath they bowed their head and I stood up and reached across the table, laying a gentle finger on both their shoulders. Wind rushed through the room as the souls left them. Their shoulders shook as they slumped forward. The appearance of their bodies were so peaceful they might have been sleeping. As was the way with all whose path had crossed mine.    
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was alone, the last being left in the universe, left behind with only the dead. My work was done. As with the two whose bodies lay before me, my role was over. The end of an age had come and I remained by myself, the last enemy to be destroyed. Crossing round to the other side of the table, I stepped out to stand in front of the wreckage of the mirror, now a portrait of the dying earth. I, Death, looked out across space, the vast emptiness, the utter loneliness, to the one place which had once held Life. I found it was beautiful.

* Her role as second in command to Coulson is diminished - Mack took over as Acting Director that time Coulson went into the portal  
* Her fighting badassness is almost never being shown any more, more time is focused on Daisy's new fighting skills, especially with how her powers are now incorporated into them  
* The autopilot system has been shown several several times now. And also, what kind of a crappy role is just 'pilot'  
* Andrew died and became Lash. Then Lash died.
  
So given all these things that happened this season, May's role, we noticed, was kind of becoming redundant, so we thought it would be the conclusive end to her character arc to kill her off in that last episode.  
  
Well they didn't. Which means they were just being a dick to her character. Which is a shame. Her death would at least have been an acceptance of her character's diminshed importance and the progression into a new era of SHIELD.  
  
Having said all that, I'm really glad she didn't die. To be fair, she had I think one, possibly two really awesome action sequences in that last episode.

Coulson is struck by the whole ordeal and allows each team member to pursue their own things for a bit, Mack with his brother, Lincoln with gathering ex-Afterlife members, etc.  
  
Season 4 opens with Coulson **calling them all back.** Why? Because something important has been stolen. My ideal imaginationy idea would be that Helmet Zemo has been kidnapped from the CIA - and they are entrusting SHIELD to under subterrefuge, bring him back. Coulson is eager for the mission to be done correctly because it would be a huge step in legitimizing SHIELD and open up great collaboration with the CIA.  
  
Zemo has been kidnapped by some notable new bad guys (it would start the next **new** chapter in evil villain group history), perhaps AIM or Serpent Society or whatever. However, they used mercenaries who were caught on tape issuing Zemo out of the area. And those mercenaries are... **Bobbi and Hunter.**

Marvel are well within their rights not to show it at all. In fact I really don't want them to do it in full AGAIN. But here's how I want them to just tease it:  
  
Tony's PTSD has escalated to simple flashbacks. He still is haunted by the things he has done: Pepper falling from the tower in IM3, Cap bearing down on him with his shield from the end of Civil War, Rhodey falling out of the sky. Throughout the beginning of the movie we see him struggling to deal with these things (perhaps *properly* setting up his alcoholism).  
  
At some point he gets mad at Peter. Peter always seems to be driving himself to something he can't achieve, expecting too much, then blaming himself. Tony asks him **""WHY?""**
  
Then Peter has a 2 second flashback. In the exact same style as Tony's, but his is of just 4 images, each lasting like half a second in quick succession: him storming out the house, Uncle Ben following, Uncle Ben getting shot, Peter leaning into hear Uncle Ben whisper something as he dies.  
  
Then Peter replies to Tony, **""I've lost people too. And it's been my fault.** and Tony understands and then officially treats him like a son for the rest of the MCU.  
  
So I feel this would not only put a depth to their relationship, but also be an amusing nod to Sony's repeated telling of that story (to the point to which we are sick of it). And Disney's way of saying, we can get away with it. That 2 second flashback shows almost nothing, yet we know exactly what's going on so its sufficient, and it's ALL they do on the matter.

But today, as I was questing after one such group on Experimental, I was on top of one team member and moving with him, the same size. His guy couldn't feed him without accidentally feeding me, so we were at an impasse. Then out of nowhere, this random player, on average mass, firstly **fires a virus** into the teammate of the guy I was hunting, then after **not collecting any of the resultant mass** for his own selfish gain, **feeds, then splits himself into me,** instantly letting me take over the remains of both members of the team and **placing me #1.**  
  
Okay, so I don't know what to do at this point, he hangs around me and nudges me to feed him back. So I'm indebted to this guy, I feed him and, against all my moral code, begin forming an attacking team and we take out a few around us. But then this doesn't feel right to me, and I'm stuck there next to him, and I decide just to split into him and give him everything.  
But, as I split into him in what I thought was feeding him, I **accidentally eat him.** Yeah I fucked up. Bad.  
  
At this point I'm so stunned, I basically just split again, get an eighth of me eaten by some opportunistic big guy lurking near me, the rest I feed into a spawner.

Do they help? Absolutely. They really have given me a strong sense of phrasing, communication, common sentence structure and word choice. I fully recommend this and watch french films (Amélie, Intouchables) if you are studying a language.  
  
Why does it work? Simply because I know the script of most episodes word for word, so when each odd phrasing comes along, I can basically spot the correlation, how one would phrase what was intended and familiarize myself with that. Community works better than most (sitcoms) because there's NO LAUGH TRACK and all the jokes and dialogue are so quick-paced and intricate that you can learn a lot.
  
Yes I can speak French well now. Or as they say in France, *oui, je parle bien français maintenant* XD

Of course, that all went to hell after Dan got fired from showrunner. Moses Port and David Guarascio brought the show right back round to being set in the school, with their attempts to duplicate that beyond-Greendale notion being some of the most stupid episodes ever written - *Conventions of Space Time* (how could you waste Matt Lucas like that!?), *Intro to Felt Surrogacy* (puppets) and *Intro to Knots* (Spent 20 minutes tying up a professor in their living room, with goddamn KEVIN).  
  
So, when Dan got brought back, his efforts to repilot the story to where he wanted and make the characters interesting again meant he had to sacrifice the other development he'd wanted to go to. i.e. how they'd transition to leave campus. Not being able to do that left him stuck with the Save Greendale Committee which by his own admission in *Emotional Consequences* was stupid and a pretty flimsy reason for them to interact.
Even the Jeff-the-Teacher storyline was visibly weak and very hard to make coherent, possibly because he had to spend so much time fixing other characters' stories that hadn't gone where he'd wanted to in Season 4 that there wasn't enough time to properly do Jeff-the-Teacher. I think we spent two episodes in Jeff's lessons, the plots of which actually contradict each other (in the first he discovers his unexpected love for teaching thanks to Annie, in the second, he bungs of teaching and shows his class a nature video instead ""like every other lesson""). Its clear its just a device of convenience (and an insubstantial one at that) to allow Jeff to interact with the group.   
  
So my question is, **how do you**, the creative mind of the fandom, **think Dan WOULD have done the Season 4 transition out of Greendale**, and what storyline WOULD he have set up for himself for Seasons 5 and 6 so as not to necessitate remaining on campus?  
Please feel free to mention the other issues that come about in the later seasons, such as that as the audience we DO feel that Annie (and Jeff, and Abed!) deserve better than to be stuck in a Community college after so many years, the flanderisation of Britta and her various failures, and the use of the Dean and Chang's characters.  
  
Please respond if you agree and rebuttal if you don't, this is an issue I care about quite a lot.
