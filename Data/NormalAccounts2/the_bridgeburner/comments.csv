90,"I've read Hyperion (all 4) and Malazan (all 17). My verdict are both are awesome books with excellent storylines. But personally I will rate Malazan much higher than Hyperion. But nevertheless, Hyperion is a very well woven tale. It is not for everyone though as the combination of dark storylines, heavy leaning on poetry and philosophy is a turnoff for many people that I know.

Malazan on the other hand is witty, epic, sad all while being very dark sometimes. And you can connect with many of the Malazan characters on a much more human level than any characters from the Cantos.

Flora and fauna. Plants and animals. Not plants and fruits. It'd need a pretty stupid god to create plants that cannot create fruits.

161,"Many programs can be simply extracted and run. Even the ones that are typically ""installed"". Its called portable versions. They simply take all the files and folders from the installed program and zip it up for use without installation. The drawback in such programs usually is that they won't remember your settings the next time you run them as they are distributed as files/folders without the corresponding windows registry entries that allows for shell/context menu integrations and preservation of preferences.

Dependence on Java or Dot Net is not why installation is required. Programs can figure out where the dependencies are present using the values of system environment variables.

So most programs can be used with installers or as ""portable"" versions with the usual trade off being saving and preservation of preferences and system integrations (like Open With option on Right Click Menu etc.). There are some programs that integrate tightly with the operating systems and update/replace system libraries which have to be installed with an installer because uninstalling them manually would be very intricate. The installer in such cases backs up the changes it does so that while running the uninstaller, it knows what to replace or restore to get the system back to the original state.",2015-11-21 18:17:25+00:00,cx85usi,1,t3_3tp4b0,11973,explainlikeimfive

254,"Indian here. Chai is Hindi (and a couple of other Indian languages) for tea. Chai+Spices (like cardamom here) is called Masala Chai where Masala is Hindi (and again, a few other languages) for Spices. In US/Canada/Europe, people (usually) tend to sell Chai as anything that originates from India. Take Starbucks for example, Chai Tea Latte. Chai in India is usually made with milk and is not black. So if you see, Chai Tea Latte translates to Tea Tea Latte. Just trying to make quick bucks off of people's lack of knowledge about foreign terminology.

Anyway don't try to make tea out of that as you'll be drinking boiled cardamom water which will not taste anywhere close to the definition of good. If you have tea leaves at home, make a nice cup of cardamom tea and if you want to have it like we do in India, add milk to it. The usual concentration here is 1/4th cup of milk to 3/4th cup of tea and sugar to taste. Heat the milk though so it does not lower the temperature of the tea. Another tip will be to crack open the cardamom pod slightly and boil it with the pod itself for that extra dash of flavour.

305,"I don't like using the same example over and over again but I've read Malazan and ASoIaF back to back so these two are fresh in memory. If you have read Malazan, you'd know what I mean when I say that I want the dragons to be in the story and be awesome but not go all guns blazing and totally dominate anything and everything.

I'm all for having storylines that are not really relevant if they add a touch of humour or are used for world building etc. but with the amount of irrelevant-ness GRRM has in the book is probably the result of him taking too many breaks between books and thus losing track of where he left it off last and taking some time to get back into the proper flow. I can't find the reference now (midnight here) but he himself has admitted that had he started on WoW right after he finished DoD then he'd have made more progress as he kinda lost track of the direction he wanted to go after DoD and it took him a while to find that touch. With less meandering about he could have trimmed what was not really necessary and made more progress and we may have had our next book earlier.

Don't get me wrong, I love the core storyline. It's just that it'd have been better if it was shorter. Malazan is very very huge but then, there, on the contrary you get the feeling that you cannot get enough of a character most of the time than the feeling I sometimes have in some POVs here.

306,"&gt; I see what you are saying here, but the problem is the timing of the other things. He'd only be able to show Daenarys a few more times. There are at least 4 groups of people seeking her out at the moment, making their way to her. Then there is the component of her goals in Meereen and how it will play into her making it to Westeros. Daenerys would just become a secondary character or a huge portion of the story would go unexplained and unexplored if he just breezed through it.

He could have kept her parts crisper and shorter by having less of her POV chapters, no need to curtail the timeline. The whole thing about Quentyn Martell was utterly inconsequential. Having less of her could have meant more time for the mysteries of the maesters and Old Town or even exploring Valyria more. He could have used the concept of time skip to show how she has or hasn't matured during that time. No need to show the excruciatingly boring Mhysa saga.

&gt;You just want the dragons to start burning and eating everything and being awesome dragons. So do I. But if that happened, the story would be over real quick. Her dragons also aren't full sized yet, which is the other thing (and has to do with the timing I mentioned). If she took them over now they would likely be killed sooner rather than later. She needs somebody to help her control them. She's at least being somewhat smart about that, except that instead of even trying to do it herself she is focusing on saving people from slavery, etc.

Frankly, not really. Having the dragons burn stuff left and right would be a deus ex machina almost and that'd not be a lot of fun unless it's against the others who are really overpowered anyway.",2015-07-06 16:26:08+00:00,cstxj94,7,t1_csttses,6518,gameofthrones

308,"&gt; Wait, so he should have written them like another author wrote characters of a similar age...?

He could have handled her character better than how he did till now is that I mean.

&gt; It is very clear that part of Daenerys' problem is that she is not listening to her advisors and that she is suffering from it.

Um, that's why OP is asking others if they find her unlikeable and I agree that I too find her unlikeable.

That GRRM wrote her slightly worse than other characters has nothing to do with how old the characters are. He has dragged on her storyline for no apparent reason other than filling up pages. I might not be aware of his future plans but the way he has made her languish in Essos is utterly boring. If he wishes to say that dealing with Meereen and all is a part of building her up as a good ruler for Westeros then I do not buy that. Her story is boring and dull as far as I am concerned. How one can have dragons around and still be a boring character is very baffling!

My expectations were more related to GRRM rather than Dany. He had an awesome premise with Dany after Drogo's death and the birth of the dragons and he could have used that storyline to great effect. Her parts could have been shorter and crisper and could have still covered how she is clueless, ignores her advisors, learns a lesson and then becomes wiser from it. He could have then brought the dragons into the picture and would have had a fantastic way to bring her back into Westeros politics. But sadly what we have is slaves and Meereen and a shit ton of pages which are utterly drab.

Danerys doesn't need to know the right answers or whatever, but at that age, it is expected that you draw upon history or your advisors' knowledge and not act as a clueless brat.

311,"In India, using acid to attack women is a common way of revenge by spurned lovers. This is more common among the smaller towns than in cities and there too it is rapidly on the wane, for good. So those that are saying the source of acid being car batteries etc. are right to an extent but that is not the case most of the times. Believe it or not, many people in India, even today, use acid as a toilet cleaner. Although normal toilet cleaners have been readily available in the country for decades now, there are some who still cling to the age old way of using diluted acid to clean ceramic surfaces of the toilets. To cater to these folks, you'll find concentrated acids in some of the smaller grocery stores, especially in small towns. It is sold just like any other grocery item with no regulations or questions asked. When you have access to corrosive materials like that, all it takes is the desire to hurt someone and a wild leap of thought resulting in such acid attacks. The most common way is to use a hollowed out lightbulb filled with the acid and throw it at the victim. The intention usually is to disfigure the victim's (usually a woman) face with the rationale being ""if you rejected me then no one will ever accept you after this"". In other cases, they threaten the victim (also most women) walking down an isolated street with an acid attack on the face if they don't part with their jewellery/valuables etc. All this used to be more common but thankfully is rapidly declining as a result of modernization of culture and more and more people having access to education.",2015-07-05 14:48:40+00:00,cssuh9l,1,t3_3c6s30,12463,explainlikeimfive

323,"Personally I do not like Terry Brooks' work at all. But that's me and there is no reason everyone should like the same books.

Anyway, the next ASoIAF book will at best and I really mean at best, come out in late 2016. That's how bad GRRM is in allocating time to his most important work, i.e. his upcoming books. He has admitted himself that he attended too many book signings, tours, conferences etc. in the last couple of years and lagged behind on his writing. He even admitted that he could have made better progress if he had continued writing right after the last book came out and that he lost the flow of the story and it took him a lot of time to get back into the groove again. Anyway, enough venting. What I wanted to say is that if you've seen the show then you know the story and if you finish the 5 books then you wait for more than a year or so to read the next one.

On the other hand, by the time you catch up with all Malazan books, the new trilogy would probably be close to completion. And by that time the release of the next ASoIAF book would be that much closer too. So go with Malazan and may Burn's blessings guide you through the journey!",2015-06-18 20:00:05+00:00,csb2zqr,6,t1_csb2boj,982,gameofthrones
324,"You're in for a wild ride in that case. Don't worry, Malazan will last you for a month or so if you're a serious reader. Plus there are close to 20 books in the whole series (the main one being 10 books long and then there are other stories which you'll want to read once the main 10 are done). It is an epic fantasy and the author does not do a lot of information dumps so you cannot just skim and expect to understand. Also, you'll feel lost in the first book as Steven Erikson just drops you in the middle of the story. You'll need to finish the first 3 books and then you'll get an understanding of how everything so far fits nicely into an overarching plot which is huge to say the least. But trust me, no matter how confusing you find it, read at least till then end of book 3 and I'm sure you'll be hooked.

The way he sets up his books (save the first one) is that the first half of the book is character building and some details about the world/country/place where things will happen and then from the second half things start to boil and the end of each book is awesome. Mostly each book has a story line that reaches some sort of conclusion at the end and each book contributes to the overall plot which is tied up excellently in the last book. While Steven writes about the main arc, Ian's books (set of 7) explains the series of events that take place in other parts of the world in parallel to the main arc. Those are very well written and are a good read to say the least. Also, these guys are writing prequels and sequels so it'll be something to look forward to in the future as well.

And both of them are relatively young so no worries about them dying without finishing the story!",2015-06-18 14:52:15+00:00,csaqftp,4,t1_csaprtp,1137,gameofthrones

331,"Karsa shatters one of Fener's tusks using his flint sword. The sword itself is an Imass sword and is aspected. Karsa in himself is a warren. Fener was no more a God and was thrust into the mortal realm by Heboric Light Touch. When forced to manifest in such a way, Gods/Ascendants are very vulnerable since they're no more in their own realm where they can control all it's aspects. Putting it all together I can see how Fener was killed.",2015-06-18 01:34:22+00:00,csa8iqc,2,t1_cs9h87f,46776,Malazan
332,"Please do not read about the books on the internet. You'll spoil the fun. Everyone who reads Malazan feels lost initially. I went through the whole GoTM without having a clue of what's going on. Things slowly make sense as you move onwards and therein lies the fun. They say for a reason that the series is made for a re-read. Take a plunge into the unknown and enjoy the experience.

333,Do not read the ICE books before the Eriksen ones no matter what one says. ICE is not as great a writer as Eriksen and you'll end up not getting used to either of their styles. ICE has his own way of explaining stuff so better read it later.

335,"I agree with everyone here who says that the Malazan world is huge but one thing they missed is that there are other books by Ian Cam Esslemont (ICE) which tell us the tale of what goes on in parallel to the main storyline. Also, Eriksen is writing a nice trilogy about how the whole Malazan universe began (the first book is already out) and ICE is writing a new series on how the Malazan empire was founded. So the world is huge and we're getting to know more about it.

In my opinion WoT is a great series but it pales slightly in comparison to the Malazan books. Wish you the best for your journey and would like to know what you think of the books when you finish them. Burn's blessings be with you!",2015-06-18 01:18:20+00:00,csa819g,1,t3_3a7xt8,8781,Malazan
