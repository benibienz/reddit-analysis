grant all privileges to user;
and it would work just fine. (I know all privileges is not a recommended thing but this is a development box and is used by one guy only)

But since this new version, whenever I install the app with the ""all privileges"" user, for some reason one particular table does not get created and the app doesn't work.

Now if I create the same user with specific grants like create/drop tables, sequences etc. then everything works fine. From what the developers tell me, there has been no change in the code that creates these tables on installation. So is there any possible difference were having all privileges would work differently than specific set of privileges? I'm on Oracle 12c btw and it is not setup in the CDB/PDB mode.",oracle,"App behaves differently when user created with ""all privileges"" vs certain specific ones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oracle/comments/4xupib/app_behaves_differently_when_user_created_with/

1. What according to you did Osserc do? Did he fight Spite for the shard and somehow allowed that shard to reunite with the Crippled God? Just fighting Spite would not put him in the condition he was in the end as I'm pretty sure he was much more powerful than her.

2. What did Saeng do? Why in the world was there a temple to light in Jacuruku? I get that due to her intervention, the ritual of the circle of masters is interrupted and due to her efforts and what happens elsewhere (TCG), the Visitor is sent back. But what does she do? Is it supposed to be left to our imagination?

3. This is maybe just venting but Kallor?? I saw no point in that whole storyline.

4. What's the deal with Thryllan being closed and all? Why did Osserc close it and when? And who were the entities that took him back.
