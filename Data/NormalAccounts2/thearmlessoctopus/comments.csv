5,"I didn't make the survey, someone else in the group did (someone who's first language isn't english). I appreciate your feedback though, however I can't have it redone as we'd lose the statistics of the people we've already asked and I wouldn't feel comfortable because the fact that he can write that well in english even with the mistakes is way better than my French which I study with my course so I wouldn't have a leg to stand on so to speak.

16,"Hey man, I am studying in Montreal in September and started longboarding a bit and I can't skateboard. Truth be told I'm not great at either and have crippled myself a few times. Still I am determined to learn, and so was wondering where the best place would be to pick up a real cheap board for a beginner, maybe a penny board or a cruiser, to be honest I don't know what I want maybe something where they can give good advice and/or have a large selection of boards?
