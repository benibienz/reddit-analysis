* 800-1600 euro. Ireland (Online purchase presumably preferable).

**Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

* Really don't like the 2 in 1 form factor. A good battery is preferable but not at the sake of losing specs.#

**How important is weight to you?**

* Lighter is better due to extensive travel as of June/July next year but not at all crucial.

**Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**

* I have been using windows up until this point with adequate satisfaction, however am also quite interested in the Linux operating system and very open to adopting it.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

* Once again referencing future travel plans somewhat on the small side is preferable but the specs that you lovely folks deem necessary for my uses are considerably more important.

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A**

* Ok here is where things get interesting. :) I have a keen interest in pursuing animations (unrelated to college work) and would as such like to be able to run animation programs (open to suggestions on which programs). As well as that I have been developing an interest in music making programs such as fruity loops and ableton live. I do not know what specifications these require, hence my reliance on all of your greater expertise.

**If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

* No explicit need for use as a gaming laptop.

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

* A good keyboard is essential (preferable to have a light up keys, for typing in dim light). As it will be used in the speedy jotting down of lecture/tutorial notes and the like an ergonomic keybaord is key. Furthermore I am an avid writer in my spare time.

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

* I would require a durable laptop as I am a broke, debt incurring student and simply can't afford another laptop after this one for quite some time. As such it'll have to see me through my final year of college (the laptop I have used for the last year and a half two years has an outrageously smashed screen) as well as my travels and work after that point.

* I am not well versed in the area of electronics and am completely dependent on your advice and recommendations. I apologies for the lack of information related to specifications and such.

I asked them about the vaporisers that look like inhalers. there were two one for 140/150 or something and a newer one for 175 but could be upgraded and was purple (it looked awesome). Anyway I was wondering if there is a better/cheaper place to but them, or would I be just as weel of getting a MLFB? What's the best vaporiser in your opinion? oh and one more question, I bought so weed today but the guy only had like a gram, what's the best place to procure bud? I'm looking for about an 8th. Cheers guys!
