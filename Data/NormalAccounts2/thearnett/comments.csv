28,For the doombringer and hexing pants it would be better to just have any ancient.  The 100% damage increase for an ancient will easily beat out the stats/passives from your bis pieces.  The gloves are a judgment call due to the passive but likely will follow suit with the other pieces.  You just will have to see how the extra 100% damage and 4% damage reduction feel in game against the gloves' passive.,2016-02-03 15:38:36+00:00,czmbs35,1,t3_4404jr,2589,Diablo3Crusaders
