125,"Guy here
This case is extreme. It is disheartening going out of your way for anybody and feeling like you weren't appreciated, we can all understand that. But he took it too far. I open doors for men and women alike and I'm not trying to sound sexist but from my perspective men do seem to express appreciation at a muuuchh higher rate than women(generalization based on experience). Now I don't think men should hold doors open for women. They should be independent and don't need the help, we shouldn't be obligated to simply for being born as males. But like I said, I still do, but I don't hold doors open for people for their benefit. As stupid as it sounds, I just like doing it to make myself feel better. I have self esteem issues like many men, even though we are encouraged not to talk about it and something as simple as a thank you can really make me feel good about myself. It makes me feel appreciated, and that I have value. When I go out of my way and people don't even acknowledge it, I feel like they view me as lesser, that even though I went through the conscious and physical effort to make their day easier, they couldn't even give me a verbal phrase of appreciation. I'm not expecting a huge thing, but ""thanks"" is enough. This is not an issue of man and woman, it is an issue of gratification.
