I can never feel satisfied with anything anymore including food and I don't know how to overcome this and get myself to eat right. Throughout the day I do okay, but at night when I sit in my room alone with barely enough energy to sit around doing nothing and no motivation for anything but staring at the walls, I just eat nonstop.

I've been to so many psychologists and social workers, I've tried meditation, leaving my comfort zone, getting a job and joining clubs that I had no interest or motivation to join so I could make friends. I've put in so many years of effort for nothing. I don't want to be drugged up, and I am sick of 'talking it out'. No matter how hard I try I'm just struggling to not kill myself let alone be happy which just seems like a pipe dream at this point. I have no clue what to do, there's no point in suffering when nothing will get better. All I hear is about how it will get better as if that is supposed to make up for the many past years of anguish and all of those yet to come. I'm not close to my family, have never had a girlfriend, only have 1 friend who I hate so much but its better than being alone to some extent but I hate being around them. I have no motivation for anything and can't stop thinking of how much of a drag the simplest things in life are. I just do my school work, go back to my dorm, and sit around trying to convince myself to get that thing I've been putting off for weeks done, or try to get myself to do laundry. I feel so bad I can't stop thinking about ending it, because there seems no reason to keep going other than that bullcrap of 'it gets better' I've been hearing for 5 years.

I always hear starving will cause one to bounce back even worse once the fast is broken. Also for my specific personal situation what advice could you guys give me? I am 245 lbs and have been losing about 2 lbs a week on a counting calorie diet. So this fast would be for weight loss as opposed to cleansing for me personally. Would counting calories or doing that and intermittent fasting be most beneficial for me/=? I hear so much contradictory info about if this is a reputable option or not and would love some clarification. Also maybe a recommended regiment for an overweight beginner Thank you guys for your help.,fasting,Advice for a newbie?,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/47nwqw/advice_for_a_newbie/
