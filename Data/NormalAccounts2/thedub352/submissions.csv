I never liked living at home and never wanted to stay in state for college. So when the time came I applied to a few out of state colleges.When I got accepted to an amazing out of state college, you could imagine my excitement. However, it did not go as planned. My first semester I kept to myself because I knew no one and I had terrible social anxiety because I'm very self conscious about the way I look; I was never good at socializing (still not) so it was hard for me to talk to anyone. I procrastinated a lot, but don't get me wrong, I still studied my ass off. I just couldn't focus and none of the material was sticking. I was literally forgetting everything I was learning and wasn't understanding it. At the end of the semester I found out just how bad I did, I got a 0.69 GPA, I was devastated and embarrassed. I was only taking 3 classes/ 13 credits and I could even do well, I hated myself. I was too ashamed and embarrassed to tell anyone, so I kept it to myself. When my parents asked about the semester, I lied and said everything was alright. I didn't want to disappoint them because they sacrificed a lot to send me off to college. I thought I could bounce back and do better. 

The next semester I tried even harder. I was placed on academic probation and had to meet with an advisor. He told me to keep at it and try harder to succeed, not really good advice on how to move forward. I met a lot more people who became my closest friends, and it helped that some had the same major/area of study as me so I had a few people to study with. But even with that, come test time, I could remember anything I studied hours on end for. I failed many tests and therefore didn't do well that semester either, although I did do a littler better than last, 1.7 GPA. I was placed again on probation. 

This continued to happen my sophomore year until I was recessed that summer. When I relieved that email, my world fell apart. Again, I kept this a secret and told no one. I stayed there because I signed an apartment lease and could't just back out. So I started going to the local community college in secret and kept it from everyone. I didn't do so well there either; the same problems I had at the university I had at the community college: not being able to concentrate and forgetting what I learned. 

After a year, my parents finally found out about my recess. They said I want trying hard enough and that all I was doing was partying and not focusing on my schoolwork. I tried to explain that this was not true and that I was partying only when I could and I didn't make it interfere with school. But they didn't believe me, or chose not to. This is when I panicked and stopped answering their calls and I felt as though I was nothing. I moved back home and my parents said I had to find work and continue my education.

This is where I am now, I have found a job, but I don't have the grades to transfer to another university. I did get accepted to the local community colleges, but after what happened, I feel as though school isn't for me. I do want to get an education, but I don't know how I can after doing so badly before. 

Ever since being recessed, I have felt as though I'm depressed. I have contemplated suicide everyday and a few times I almost went through with it. I have never told anyone this and I don't know if I can. My relationship with my parents is not good as of now and no one else in my family knows of what happened. I'm going to community college in the fall, but I don't know what I want to do with my life. I struggle to get out of bed each morning because I feel like a walking failure and everyday that passes, I think of suicide more and more. I don't know what to do with my life, and I feel as though I have no one to talk to; it's hard for me to even write this. If anyone can give me some advice on what to do I'd be grateful.
