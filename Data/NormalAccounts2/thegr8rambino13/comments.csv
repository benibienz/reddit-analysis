896,"My man, everything happens for a reason. And not everyone we meet will stay in our lives forever. But, our meeting them was no accident. They came along in our lives to either teach us something, show us something, help us through something, or even to hurt us to teach us a lesson or two. My point is that this girl was probably not ""the one"". I'm sure it felt that way, and probably still does, but its still only been a month. That's not very long, and not nearly enough time to heal. I'm actually going through a very similar thing myself with another girl. It is a pickle, no doubt about it, but my best advice to you is this: you have to learn to love yourself again. You spent all that time loving her, and probably forgot to love the most important person: you! Don't think of this time as suffering, think of it as an opportunity to rediscover yourself, who you were, and if that's still the person you want to be! And trust me - you will get through this. It does not last forever. One day you might look back and wish you never stressed so much about it. Also, get rid of anything and everything that reminds you of her, unless it makes you laugh or adds value to your life, before you met her. Like for instance, me and this girl love Seinfeld, but I know I can't get Seinfeld out of my life, nor would I want to. Besides, I already know about and loved it way before I met her. And everyday since we stopped talking, in the back of my mind I secretly wonder/hope I'll hear from her again someday, saying that she wants to be friends again. But I tell myself, I've been down that road already. I know what its like, where it leads to, and from what i remember, it started to get pretty uncomfy! Why should I go back? And I know I can't keep thinking about that, because its not doing me any good. And you know what? I know one day, I won't even think about it anymore. 

Also, let go of any and all anger and hatred and vengeance you may have towards her because it only hurts you. If karma thinks she deserves something, then she will get hers. Period. I should be taking all this advice for myself lmao. Believe in yourself. Talk about your feelings with someone close and near and dear. Just let it all out and have a good cry! Sometimes even the toughest of men need a good cry. You will feel reborn afterwards lol. Some day, all of the love you gave out will find its way back to you - and stay :) you are gonna be just fine!

I stopped cold turkey a month ago and lost 13 pounds and my blood pressure went down too! Now I don't even want soda anymore, except sparkling water which I've gotten used to. I'll have a muffin or some pastry with coffee to get my sugar fix. I think the biggest mistake people make is cutting out sugar completely, because it makes you want it even more! The trick is, I think, to focus it on only where you really want it, and keep it there. Moderation. Control. If you have no control, you're lost. Find out what's keeping you from losing control. What's making you eat all these foods in the first place? I think its perfectly normal to want to eat something sweet every now and then, but when you do it constantly, thats indicative of a bigger problem. I guarantee you its almost always something mental/psychological. ",2016-05-07 11:27:58+00:00,d2w90h6,1.0,t3_4i7uy4,40265.0,Fitness

And I doubt you would pay me, but if I ever come up with the details, I just might let you know, if I remember, lol.

Hi! So about a year ago I got 4 gigs more ram for my system, bringing it to its max total of 8 gigs. I also put in a new graphics card. After I put in the new components, I noticed whenever it goes to sleep, the monitor goes dark, the PC power button blinks and the graphics card fans start screaming at full speed! So I had to do a force shutdown, and upon reboot it tells me this: "" Your systems's firmware did not preserve the system memory map across the hibernate transition. If you proceed with resume, your system could behave inan unexpected manner after resume completes. It is recommendedthat you saveall your data and reboot the system after resume finishes. Kindly check for a  firmware update with your system vendor as it may fix this problem.""

It doesn't show this message anymore, but it still acts this way if I put it to sleep, which I've disabled for now. Does anyone know what the heck is causing this? Is my ram bad, or what? It would also do this even if i did an orderly shutdown from the start menu, but now it just shuts down normally with no screaming fans. Here are my pc specs:

Gateway FX7026 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300 @ 2.5GHz 8GB ( 4X2 GB) DDR2 667 G.SKILL RAM EVGA 1024MB GTX 460 1TB Seagate SSHD + 320GB HDD 400W Delta electronics PSU Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit SP1

And Iran has no desire to confront any western or eastern power. It simply wants to be left alone to prosper. Unfortunately you have probably never been to Iran and don't know what they are really like and make assumptions based on what you have seen on fox news and think that's the truth. You are probably an old, ignorant, close minded american who has refuses to think for himself or even realize that our government and media has been lying to us about almost everything for a while. Iran may say some very hostile things that it does not always mean, but that was mostly with the last president. Recently Obama has been trying to mend relations with iran for the better, because nobody wants another war, except maybe Israel.  They were so eager to bomb iran, when iran has not attacked another country in over 200 years. Do you SEE now????? Not to mention the fact that it's come out now that israel paid us senators to sabotage the iran deal. GREAT country /s. It is all about Israels quest for control of the middle east and always has been. And apparently we are ""swell pals"" with countries like Saudi Arabia who do even WORSE things, dumbass!

Iran has been producing all of its weapons on its own as well because of sanctions, and it has worked out very well for them, because only they know the weaknesses of their own hardware, instead of buying it from someone else. Israel is a leech on america and do nothing for us. Iran has a very deep and rich culture and tradition, and does not attack and bulldoze the homes of its neighbors. Who is israel or the US to tell iran they cannot have nuclear weapons when they themselves have thousands? Who gives them this right? Nobody. So take the Zionist cock out of your mouth. Why do you think Israel was so nervous about the iran deal? Because they know iran will start developing much more advanced weapons than them. If iran is so weak why has Israel not attacked it yet?

Don't believe for a second the US has ""good intentions"" and cares for the Syrian people. Look what we did to Iraq and Afghanistan. Everything we do over there is motivated by money, control, or Israel. We've killed over a million Iraqis so far, thousands in Afghanistan, Libya, and now Syria because of our actions. We recently KNOWINGLY bombed a hospital in afghanistan, and proceeded to accuse russia of doing the same thing in syria, when those hospitals didnt even exist. And now the US can't really do anything because its proxy mercenary army ISIS and the ""rebels"" are being wiped out by Russia , which was asked by Syria to intervene, thus has every legal right to be there. We don't. And that's it. We should just come home, stop getting involved, stop wasting millions and billions that could be spent here, and save ourselves another 5, 10, or 20 years more of war and misery over there.

I suggest you look up a talk general Wesley Clark made in 2007 about how before 9/11 even happened, the government had a plan to attack and invade/destabilize SEVEN middle eastern countries in 10 years. Theyve gotten Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Egypt, and Yemen. Which is the last country? Iran, and I pray to God not a single nation, including your beloved israel touches her, for I have family there. I'm really glad you agree with me on some things at least, but to think that im naive for thinking we should not be engaged in the world is rather pessimistic. Do you think america needs to be involved in and at war with someone forever? I bet the military industrialists would love that, more money for them, but the citizens have to pay for it in taxes and a lower standard of living. If America ever falls, God forbid, it will be because we did it to ourselves. We attempted to take on too many ""enemies"" or we wrecked ourselves financially. Think about it, Russia and China would never just outright attack us, unless we provoke them. This is a natural law of the universe, if you pose no threat, have not done or said anything provocative, or have nothing of value, the chances of someone attacking or harming you are very low. So much lives would be lost and destruction and for what?  Peace through strength, not by force. As for Israel/Palestinians, maybe the reason they fire rockets from those places is because it makes it harder for Israel to shoot back, compared to any unmarked building or out in the open. Simple military tactic. And again, if Israel is serious about peace and decides its had enough of doing whatever it wants to the west bank and Gaza, it should support a two state solutions, let them have a country they can call home, Palestine.

Our interventions in Vietnam, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo have cost countless lives and dollars wasted. Saddam Hussein and Moammar Gaddhafi may have been evil men who did very evil things, but at least they kept their countries together and did not have mass chaos, as there is now. So in effect we replaced something bad with something horrific, which I do not see an end to in the near future unfortunately. I have never said Israel is not allowed to defend itself. Every nation has the right to defend itself. However, that right must come into question when they continue to lie and do things to provoke attack. How do you know Israel goes to great lengths to minimize collateral damage? In fact, I have read reports online to the exact contrary. That is actually why Iceland put a boycott on their goods. If Israel actually left the Palestinians alone, gave them a sizable portion of land, would those terrorist groups still have a reason to fight?

8370,"So does Israel treat Muslims that live there as well as its native israelis? Why should it matter if Israel is the only liberal democracy in the middle east? I'm actually not even sure how much they believe in freedom and liberty. Never have i said i support theocratic regimes in iran. Never have i said i dont believe in western liberal ideologies, so dont you be putting words in my mouth. America is almost $20 trillion in debt. It has no business sending anymore money to any country, including Israel. We should be putting the american people first, and have our own problems to solve. In fact, continuously giving a country aid makes them weaker because it gets them comfortable depending on an outside source for sustenance. George washington himself said that america should refuse to enter into any ""entangling alliances"". We should heed his advice again. And netanyahu even said himself at a speech at congress that Israel is fully capable of handling itself if it is ever attacked, by any nation, even Iran. So no, your argument on that front is invalid. As for the Palestinian terror attacks, I don't condone violence at all, unless it is in self defense. So perhaps there is a reason they are doing this. Perhaps it is because they see Israel still as an ally of america, which has meddled in and caused a lot of trouble and death and bombing of many countries in the middle east for the past almost 30ish years (Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Egypt, and trying to with Iran) and for what purpose? Who gains from this? Certainly not the american people, nor the people living in those countries. Could the terror attacks be because of Israels past mistreatment of those palestinians? I think that is another reason. If not, why does Israel refuse to accept a two-state solution? If you look at the statistics in recent conflicts there, the death toll and cost in damages on the other side always far outnumbers the casualties on the Israeli side. It seems to me that they continuously try to portray themselves in the media as a harmless, weak, innocent little country, constantly in need of money and arms from western powers, however their actions and capabilities prove just the opposite.

Remember what mahatma ghandi said, ""be the change you wish to see in the world"". So be more environmentally friendly, be more considerate, be kinder, and more awake/educated/informed. Because your behavior will spread to people around you, and around them, and so on.  that's what the elite relies on, you not knowing any better.
