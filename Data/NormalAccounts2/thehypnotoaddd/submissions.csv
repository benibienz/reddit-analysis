The vendor says if I wanted a reship I would need a new address to send it to in case mine has been flagged. Is this super precautionary or has it likely been flagged? Should I make a small test order? As I wanted to make a few more orders in the foreseeable future. Advice appreciated. ,AgMarketplace,Chances of my address being flagged?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgMarketplace/comments/3k81un/chances_of_my_address_being_flagged/

He said recently that he can reship if he wants me to so I agreed with this. However now agora is down, surely they no longer have incentive to fulfil the reship since I cannot leave a review with proof of purchase! Do you think agora will return or do you suggest I do something else to try and get him to send it?",AgMarketplace,Will agora be back?
