This ability is so ingrained in his muscle memory/thought process that he often doesn't have much time to think out situations, rather he is just reacting, and when his physical ability is lessened and his instincts are relatively the same in sticky situations you have a much higher probability of RW3 sustaining a injury.

If people hype you and you win chips, you get the love.  If people hype you and you taking L's, hate.   More chips equals less hate.  It's the simple, and I think somewhat unfortunate way players who consider themselves arguably the best ever are treated.

Specific response

Jordan captured and recaptured everyone's imagination.  He was a true performer for the fans, he made sure to do at least one phenomenal thing a game.  He just kept upping the anti every year and exceeding expectations.  Two three peats!!  The whole time smiling and joking while punching teammates in the face in practice, (Steve Kerr I'm looking at you son!) practice, are we talking about practice!?  Jordan was the closest thing we had to superman (fall back Shaq).  Combined with him ushering in the modern age of sports marketing, it's safe to say there will never be another.  His playfulness and determination came across in such a perfectly balanced way that the memories seem half dream like. More than anything you respected him, no matter who you rooted for.  
Nowadays people look at the player and person separately.  Lebron the player is respected, not loved.  Lebron the person is hated still.  The only way he can fix it is to do more than Jordan(top the real 6 God).
Kobe the player was hated then loved.  Hated because he was/is swagger jacking Jordan's game.  Kobe the person was hated for swagger jacking Jordan's personality, mannerisms, style, etc. He was also hated for plenty of other fuc shit he did.  But it's funny what 5 rings will do for you.  That and sticking to the script for so long, I half feel people are applauding him for a lifetime achievement acting award for doing such a consistent and impressive impression of Jordan.

You know we going in

[Hook: Soundz]
I can't tell sometime with these bitches
Do they want me or do they want my riches
This lifestyle that I got is so expensive
I remember when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Or there go you over there, with your hands out
Now when you see me in the room, I stand out

I'm the man now, I'm the man now (x3)

[Verse 1: King Los]
Let's have a conversation with the competition
I'm fitting to rip your constituents in your composition
Your confidence and your compliments was all a compilation
It gets intimate as I implement all the complications
That ain't your jump shot
That's a fixed rim
Thought it was peaches and cream
That shit a bit slim
I pen puns like Pun's pen
Beat you niggas at everything
And still ain't got one win
Okay, six rings bells to me
Sick things
Jordan had six rings
This some 3-6 mafia sixteens
Had 99 problems
I had to flip on you bitches
But when they upside down
I'm number six from the 6s
Jay the only one that deserve my accolade
Kicked a freestyle but I ain't ever did a track with 'Ye
It ain't no secret
It's the shit that every rapper say
The shit a nigga rap is the shit these rappers would rather say [?]
I'm wreaking havoc
But we can have it
Meet me in traffic
I'm way up like I sleep in the attic
But I'm never sleep
Get the sleep of a addict
Boy, while you sleeping, I'm at it
I feast on the weak and dramatic
Look how deeply I crafted these verses
Niggas cop my shit just to keep it in plastic
Peep it, I'm classic
We collect the [?]
It's always the ones that's so honest that got some shit to hide
I say this in cadence on haters go find a dick to ride
I waited with patience to make it
And now I'm dignified
I'm lately debated as greatest
I'll let your bitch decide
You a bush, nigga
Who been the worst leader?
We got something in common
I ain't write this verse either
