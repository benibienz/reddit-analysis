17,"This is solely from my perspective but this is how I see it.

Depending on the views and impressions you've received over your lifetime, you treat all incoming stimuli according to the method you subconsciously develop over the course of your life. People claiming to be dead inside are maybe just value themselves much more highly, or maybe they tried to be attached at a young age and it resulted in disappointment. This isn't to say that some people aren't naturally more closed off than others. Depression and other mental disorders are good examples of this, however we only measure because they have negative impacts. We don't measure differences in how people function as long as they continue to be functional. But how you were raised and treated has just as big of an impact. An obvious example being that a person raised to believe in god will have totally different values than the exact same person raised as an atheist.

Either way, the only way to change it is to become aware of it and want it to change. You can change virtually anything about yourself if you want to. Recently I've been noticing my memory is terrible, which I think is tied in to my depression and natural tendency to ruminate. So I thought that maybe trying to feel more would improve it. It honestly has, although it's a slight difference. I just don't like all the baggage that comes with caring.",2016-10-17 15:20:46+00:00,d8vsoxl,9.0,t1_d8vo9gr,6295.0,comics

I think that it's a human's form of peacocking, and we've outgrown peacocking as a species. So now women just do this ridiculous thing that is outdated and outgrown by our species because they've always done it, and because the makeup market makes SO much money off the habit that they want you to feel weird for NOT doing it. And when asked ""why"", because it really is not about being insecure, all they can say is ""look at dis, I look good"" or ""I do it for me"". However, if a girl is using makeup to gain self confidence, then that factually means she is more insecure without it. You can't need self-confidence without being insecure about something before-hand.

98,"I will say this much. The game is supposed to be as real as possible. 

Your complaints with Dragon Age are valid, as you should have been able to garner the power in a more depth-filled manner. 

With Fallout... it's a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It's literally filled with junk that everyone needs to restart civilization but no one knows where to find. And there are random mutated creatures everywhere, that pose a threat to human society, and thus need to be wiped out. If you're saying the actual setting needs some tuning, then you're deviating from the ""open world"" aspect because you would realistically need to do the things you're made to in the game. The only real problem is that the writing for the main story doesn't give you a reason to be doing these other things. What it makes you do is fine, the reasons are shoddy.

Witcher 3. Dude, you're literally complaining about them making a realistic landscape. A landscape where you can see or follow roads to most things, but you don't actually know what they are till you get there(the ? markers). A landscape where other things live, a lot of them being magical. If you're just walking into the turf of a magical spider beast, it's probably going to try to eat your ass. In all honest, I'd say random encounters and loot add to the realism. Why in the hell would you know what's going to happen in a giant magical landscape where wizards and monsters abound? Furthermore, you're literally a witcher. Going to ight things and do random jobs IS your job. It's all actually EXACTLY how it should be, and it's fantastic.

We will respond, we will crack down a little bit, but what you want is unnatural. Ignoring your bit about the Bible because the Bible is bullshit, I'll take a look at the rest of that sentence.

The constitution was put in place to protect us. You're talking about it like it's a hindrance. It's literally a list of our rights as human beings. The founding fathers had no idea the level of technology and threats we'd be dealing with nowadays. But they had set out to establish a country without the need of a king. Without the all-powerful head. You speak as though you want to surrender that, as though you are willing to give that up for safety. We live in a dangerous world. To ignore that is to be ignorant of life, but what you are saying would take away from that life. You want to trade rights and privileges for protection. You've let our dangerous world scare you, but there are so many things that can scare you, you've only picked one to fixate on.

The thing about the government is, it's a beast. It is comprised of people, not logic. When you start to give up your freedoms it will try to take more away. It will do this because it wants to protect you. But we don't elect these people to office to protect us, we elect them to office to protect our values. That's why very little changes, because of the vast amount of varied values in America. I, personally, value knowing that I am my own person and in control of my life in most aspects.

Just the hope that it could. We cannot remove all blame from a victim just because a crime was committed, she was irresponsible in how she provided her service.

The only reason why this law is in place is because the government has not yet decided that people can choose to do what they wish with their own bodies. This is the same reason why prostitution is not legal. The government, being founded in religion, still clings onto the idea that there are certain things people should not be allowed to do with their own bodies even if no harm comes of it. If I want to have sex with someone and regret it later, for whatever reason, I should not be able to say that it was rape. Likewise, if I have sex with someone because they say they'll do something for me, and they don't do it, I still agreed to that sex. She never forced it, I agreed to it. Because of this, no one was raped. But in a world where prostitution is not looked down upon, I would be able to take it to court to acquire my compensation. Because people can't do that, we call this rape when it is not.

145,"Or maybe because everyone thinks it's normal no one really stops to question it. People wanted to look better so they painted their faces. No matter what anyone says, the only reason anyone could possibly have for painting their face to look better is because they feel like their own appearance is inadequate. They only feel it is such is because they know there are better looking faces and know that theirs is inferior by comparison, thus they compensate with face paint. Any other reason for wearing it simply falls back to the fact that humans are pack animals that get pleasure from doing what other people do. Cologne is a perfect example. People felt that their smell was inadequate so they covered it up with another smell. I think flowers smell nice, I think it's really weird when a person smells like a flower. But everyone has always been told that it's normal, so it's normal. Clothes are perfectly natural, clothes are a method to keep warm for a species who naturally doesn't have much to keep them warm in cold climates. It's an application of advanced intelligence to the issue of hunting/gathering in a cold climate, by making your shelter portable. Fashion, on the other hand, is another example of people thinking their appearance is inadequate and wanting to improve it. It's gotten to the point that people will wear things that don't keep them warm in a cold environment just because they believe it looks good. And all of this just goes back to that humans are pack animals. We do as everyone else does and seek each other's approval. 

Here's an example that doesn't have much to do with appearance. Diamonds are actually worthless. Engagement rings have only been around for a hundred years or so, but they were marketed by diamond mining companies so they could be sold at higher prices. They advertised, to people who never heard of the concept, that these were essential symbols of love and devotion. People became expected to have these, it became normal. It's not natural. There's no need for people to have a object on their finger to represent how they feel, they shouldn't need anything to represent it. But nowadays, I can't imagine anyone not buying an engagement ring. In fact, even those in the poorest of financial states will go out of their way to put themselves into debt to get one just because it's expected. Because it's normal. But it's a rock, a worthless rock at that. Hell, you can even bring this to how we eat. Acquired tastes only exist because we keep eating things we don't like until we do like them just because the people around us continue to eat them. We do as those around us do.

To feel prettier for you? I legitimately want to hear the reason.

There's a ton of things you can learn from a person by a first impression. Just like if you know someone well, if they look different than normal you will notice. And regardless of those two, if I know you and your face looks substantially different than normal you can't just say ""I don't care what you think therefore you didn't notice."" It doesn't change either way. You give impressions to people based on your appearance whether you want to or not. You can't wave a hand at it and say it doesn't exist. You CAN ignore it, that's totally fine. I expect to be allowed to have an impression from your changed appearance, just like I expect you to utterly ignore my impression if you so desire. I'm not looking at people and thinking ""false advertising', I just personally think it's really dumb that painting your own face is part of ""looking nice"". 

Furthermore. You're attempting to say that it doesn't matter when I've been saying over and over that it doesn't matter. You're trying to say I should get to know a person instead of judging them by their appearance when I actually do that. But the impression exists! That's all I've been saying.

One. Manners are worthless, frivolous, made up shit. Anyone who cares about manners cares way too much about shit that people made up and about what they think.

Two. Respect is a simple thing. Respect is the evidence shown through your actions that you understand your value, and the value of the things around you.

Three. You're both just average, everyday human beings. Neither is superior. In the grand scheme, neither of you are worth anything at all. We're all basically just equally worth shit.

Four. Drive-throughs have time limits. Employees have to complete orders within the time limit. The reason why fast food is a brutal job is because you have to make all this food ridiculously fast, as heaps more gets ordered. Have you ever woken up 2 minutes before the time you leave for work? Imagine if your job was just doing your entire morning routine within those two minutes, every single two minutes for 8 hours. And imagine that, if you stop doing that or take too long, you get in trouble.

So when you talk on your phone, you ignore the person who is trying to have an interaction with you, and usually it tends to be a phone call that wasn't even a necessary one. Just one to a family member or friend. So you have nothing important going on. This means that you don't find talking to them worth your time, even though you're both valued at nada.
