They took him to the hospital, and did a battery of tests. They gave him an x-ray, catscan, mri, and even did a spinal tap for meningitis. They let him leave after keeping him for two nights, saying he had a mild concussion. Come to find out, he actually has three broken ribs. I don't know the severity of the breaks, but I assume letting someone leave with broken ribs could leave him at risk for punctured lungs and the like, leading to the potential for him to die. I'd first like to know if there's anything that can be done here. Because, while they weren't aware of the issue, I find it hard to believe that there is no evidence in any of their tests that show the broken bones.

Furthermore, when he initially left the hospital, the doctor specifically prescribed what I believe was Tylenol. He couldn't be prescribed aspirin because it's a blood thinner and he had the concussion. When he went to the pharmacy, he left with aspirin. They gave him the wrong medicine and it could have killed him.

I feel as though there is definite legal action to be taken here against malpractice. My grandparents are Christian people who don't believe this sort of thing is worth making a fuss over. However, I'm outraged that my granddad's life was almost put on the line twice, and am indifferent to their concerns.

It's a terrible phone, it can't even keep apps open. Youtube, Googe Maps, even Tinder. The one game I downloaded was a card game and it couldn't handle it. But it only cost me 30 dollars, which is an even trade of functionality and cost to me. But now, it's Christmas, so I'm going to buy a refurbished phone. I realize that if I was fine with a 30 dollar phone, I shouldn't need the newest and best. But I've got no idea where to go from there. To start:

I watch shows like anime on my phone because I don't have a computer.

I don't have a music collection, but I do listen to Pandora. 

There are a good amount of areas I don't have good reception, so I'd to have much better reception so I don't need to worry about it.

The phone I have now is absolutely terrible for typing. I'm guaranteed at least one typo per text. I would love to be able to just type a text and not have to reread it. Voice-to-text is also nice.

I would like a fast, pristine camera. I want to be able to read the words on a paper I take a picture of. I want to be able to take a picture at night and see what's happening. I want to be able to take a picture of something that's pretty far away and still be able to see it pretty clearly. But most importantly, it can't be finicky. I want to open it, snap, and have the picture.

I would really like it to be fast and accurate is what I'm getting at. Storage isn't a huge deal cause I don't have a ton of stuff to store. The size doesn't really matter. But the biggest thing of all is that I'd like it to be a bit durable. I drop my stuff a lot. This is the biggest reason I'm avoiding apple products. I will be buying a case, but I don't need something that's known for being flimsy.

I really appreciate any advice you could offer me, thank you.
