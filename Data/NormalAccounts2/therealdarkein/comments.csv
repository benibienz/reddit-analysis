0,"Please please PLEASE tell me they might let someone capture an ""Impulse Response"" of this chamber. 

For those who don't know what IR is- 
It is a way to capture the characteristic of a rooms reverb and accurately recreate it in music creation software. In other words, anyone could play music/audio in that chamber without having to be there in person.

Here is more on it -

18,"I have experience shooting with the Canon 70D. I have owned both the a5100 and the a6300 (current camera), I would say I there are positives and negatives with the a5100. 

* Night shots, the a5100 will do an ok job but as a person who loves star photography, it just didn't cut it. 
* Everyday portraits and landscape in sunny weather, it works stellarly. 
* Touchscreen makes focusing as easy as using a smartphone camera. Its fast and works well.
* The camera body is pretty small. Sometimes too small. I recommend seeing if it fits your needs in a store environment before picking it up.
* Pricing is pretty reasonable with kit lense.
* I loved the linking up with my smart phone as a remote viewscreen. Got me some shots I would never have been able to do without it. Remote power zoom is also a plus.
* Used the folding forward screen many times.
* All the manual controls are there, but the Sony interface is definitely a learning curve. Settings are all over the place. Once learned it is pretty simple.

Overall if money is not a problem, spring for a a6300. If cheap is the objective, you would be hardpressed to find a camera like the a5100 that produces such wonderful images at that price range.



Some images I took with my a5100 when I still owned it.

Tried to get some variety of images to show the range of the camera.

I like the glass a lot. Its a little more on the slow end when fully extended but it really works well once you know its limitations. The increased sensor sensitivity on the a6300 helps a lot here.

26,"If they had the right balance of strength and letting go, magnets would work for the trick. And it seems like the rope does stick to itself at 2:08. Why does he hold the rest of the rope in a ball the whole time until he sets up the trick? Except for the end he is presenting to the women. Its a misdirection. It is also to prevent you noticing what he is hiding. If the ends are not magnetic, we would not see the effects on the mic stands (acts like normal rope). But if the middle is - it is stretched enough to not connect to itself. But what about the blade? It could be made of any nonmagnetic metal (Non magnetic metals include aluminium, copper, lead, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys such as brass and bronze). There are a couple of silver colored metals in there that would pass for a blade. (Like tin, aluminium). I also find it odd that this magician doesn't test the blade on anything but the rope. Most magic acts emphasize the sharpness of the blade to cut something with some kind of demonstration. 

Idk - It seems like magnets would be the easiest way to pull this off. Hooks could work, but when he slides the knot - wouldn't that catch on a hook on the way? He starts it right where he ""fuses"" the rope together.


EDIT:
I hadn't thought about this before but if it is a higher tech trick, he could utilized an electromagnet and switch it on and off during the trick.

28,And I just noticed the cut is so clean on the ropes. Almost too clean for using a knife (even if it is really really sharp). Most ropes will have some kind of strands at the end where it is cut. It is just a theory but it seems to be a plausible explanation of the trick.,2016-09-08 06:29:19+00:00,d7dwbsv,5.0,t1_d7dss66,8038.0,videos
29,"My guess is that he used a trick rope. Notice that he only shows the woman in the audience the end of the rope to verify that it is a plain rope. He never lets anyone touch the rest of the rope. 

Also through out the entire video, he never pulls hard on the rope, that I can see, which leads me to believe it is a trick rope. 

I think he used a prepared rope with strong enough magnets to hold it together at certain intervals. This would allow the audience member to choose a location on the rope for him to cut. Notice how he resets the trick when the woman selects near the end of the rope. Having magnets would allow him to cut anywhere (within a loops worth of rope) and also allow the audience to think he was cutting it. Putting it back together is trivial with magnets in the rope. He keeps the rope taught enough that it will drop to the ground but not touch itself during the trick. The only time it does touch itself is at 2:08 when unraveling the rope. It looks like it sticks a bit to itself. (might indicate my magnets theory). 

As for the knot, it is simply a small strand of rope, looped around the rope tied to the mic stands. It is able to move because it is not a knot on the big rope, but just a small strand knotted on itself. Now I'm a bit fuzzy on how it stays in place when moved. My guess there is that the smaller strand has a magnet in it that would hold it in place with the other magnets in the larger piece of rope. 

I am not sure if this is how it is done, but it's my best guess. 


EDIT: I saw something that might prove the rope could not have been cut with the knife.

58,"Well, this is Comcast after all, lying and bending the truth is their favorite game. Honestly the guy on the phone did not seem knowledgeable on the subject, but the people he was conference calling with (3 other techs) probably were in the know. 

As for the ARP tables, I don't want to spend another hour + to get those. It was hard enough to get the tech to stop trying to make me buy new hardware. Either way, I think telling them to put on full duplex and having general knowledge of networking helped me convince them to just give me my full speed back. The original guy on the phone nearly crapped himself because I asked for exact technical details of what was happening wrong. And I asked for a direct explanation of why a Docs 3.0 modem all the sudden would lose speed like that without Comcast throttling especially without any hardware faults on my equipment.

59,"Just an FYI, I have used both a IR led wii bar (original console)+ bluetooth using Toshiba bluetooth stack and the Mayflash Wireless Sensor DolphinBar. I was having lots of issues with the Toshiba stack with not correctly reading the wiimote particularly with rotating the remote (like in mario kart). Also the wiimote didn't react quite like it did on the original wii (hard to describe). I took the plunge on the mayflash wii bar which finally fixes all the issues I had with the toshiba setup. 

.

On the mayflash, the wiimote syncs directly with the sensor bar, not the bluetooth adapter. This allows for the wiimote to stay paired with the sensor bar by just turning on the wiimote. No more hitting the sync button on the wii remote then fumbling for the mouse to start the drivers/dolphin pairing. Also the sensor bar sends the wiimote signals through usb to your computer which significantly lowers latency. I highly suggest you look into one. It was well worth the 20 I paid for it.

60,"I am not trying to circle jerk here. Just giving my experience with Comcast. The modem is brand new as of 6 months ago. I doubt it was hardware related since everything operates as it should. It is not old enough for me to think hardware failure. I bought this outright with my own money, I rented initially but then bought this new from Amazon. The environment it is located at is smoke free, air-conditioned and free from anything that would cause hardware issues. 

Also my Asus n66u is almost 3 years old and no issues in the same location. ",2016-02-04 17:27:30+00:00,cznqogl,3.0,t1_czn3y7y,52834.0,news

63,"As I said before my modem was throwing lots of errors (t3 to be exact). Started on the 31st and ended when I reset 2 days ago. But the connect problems have been going on before those errors. Still kind of weird, since before the call (2 days after the errors stopped) I was still getting only 94 mbps and after the call I got 135-140mbps",2016-02-04 17:20:20+00:00,cznqcx8,7.0,t1_czn8ktd,44638.0,news

65,"So this is what I found out from Comcast. My modem was supposedly throwing out errors left and right since the 31st and that power cycling it supposedly fixed the errors. (I don't necessarily believe this). I power cycled the modem 2 days ago. The speed still consistently gave me 94 mbps.

.  

After being on the phone for 1 hour or so, mostly on hold (advanced technical team), they determined that my modem should be getting high speeds, above 94mbps, even with the technical limitations of only having 4 channels to put signal through. 

.

The interesting thing is the tech proceeding to show my the page with the modems that are end of life/compatable ([http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/](http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/))

.

My modem is on the Extreme 105 Internet but not on the Blast! compatibility. Essentially it was marked ""end of life"" for the Blast! internet but not for the Extreme 105. As of a month or so it was on both lists as valid. A theory I have is that somehow this modem defaults their system to the lower 105mbps speed since the modem is no longer on the Blast list. 

.

After spending longer on the phone, they finally got back on and said that it should be working. I have no clue what they did on their back end. I told them about the ""full duplex"" as mentioned above. Low and behold, I am back up to 135-140mbps (my original speed I was getting with this hardware). It seems to me that something fishy is going on. The rep wanted to blame it on my router for being the problem. I calmly explained that all I wanted was the speeds I was getting before December, as much as my hardware was able to handle. (which is not the full 150mbps I pay for)

.

Long story short, it is fixed, required an hour of my time and my hunch is Comcast is doing something screwing to force upgrades.  Before my call there was no improvement. After the call it was fixed. Fishy fishy fishy....

67,"Speaking of Comcast unfair billing practices. They are charging me for 150mbps down and up until a month ago, December, I received relatively close to that speed (within 10mbps). All the sudden the new year rolls in and my speeds with all the same equipment/everything untouched is 94mbps. (-46mbps difference from the norm)

.

I called up Comcast and they tell me my modem is on the end of life list. My SURFboard SB6121 (DOCS 3.0), that is capable of 172mbps, overnight cant download past 94mbps. The speed of 94 is constant and never changes above that or below that amount. I even tried a vpn. 

.

Comcast told me that I can rent a modem from them and that would fix my issue. I think they are throttling my connection on purpose to get me to rent a modem from them. There was another redditor that described the same thing. He had 30mbps connection with the same modem I have, which dropped down to 8mbps. The redditor called a comcast tech said he would have to mess with a setting behind the scenes and magically his SB6121 has 30mbps again.

.

I am planning to report this to the FCC if it doesn't get resolved. Anyone else have this problem?

It is harder for the computer to replicate that natural sliding. One day it will get better and they will be indistinguishable.
