I am not able to get the 4G LTE Cellspot to connect. I am on Comcast and have a ARRIS SURFboard SB6190 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem. I run that into a ASUS RT-N66U Dual-Band Wireless-N900 Gigabit Router. My connection speed is 180/12mbps

I have tried the following (All setups have been on for 6-12 hours+)

* Arris to Asus router. 4G LTE Cellspot plugged into the Asus router. Results in flashing Green and orange lights. 
* Arris to Asus router. 4G LTE Cellspot plugged into the Asus router. Port forwarded for ip address of the 4G LTE Cellspot. (Ports forward 1-49151) Results in flashing Green and orange lights. 
* Arris to 4G LTE Cellspot. (Should be no firewall) Results in flashing green light and solid orange light.

I have all the plugs in the right locations on the 4G LTE Cellspot. T-mobile tech support doesn't seem to be able to help at all. 

Does anyone have the same issue/solutions?
Is there any interface to log into to see error codes other than the lights? I am able to see the device with my router. Maybe I have a lemon.

The bike is having problems with the controller to where it isn't sending the signal properly to the motor which in turn brings the magnets closer to a metal wheel (creating resistance). 

The motor I am driving is the following-

So here is the question. What parts/code would I need to safely drive this motor? It is a 12v motor, so I can't drive it from the Teensy. The best scenario is to create exercise presets. Worst case scenario would be to just us a button to turn the motor one way, then switch polarity and turn it the opposite way.

Any help to get started would be amazing!
