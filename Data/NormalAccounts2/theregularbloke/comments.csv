Getting to a 9:50 on time means leaving the house at 8:30, because traffic means I can't get to New Brunswick till 9, and then a bus ride. 

I usually just pay for meter parking on certain days, but when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a parking pass, I wish I could park anywhere without getting a ticket. 

That being said, it's hard to complain about all that when you're saving $10k+ a year on tuition. ",2016-11-10 05:47:23+00:00,d9tzfvr,1,t3_5c4gvl,23347,rutgers
