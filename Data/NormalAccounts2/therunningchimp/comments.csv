9,"This is for our ""Russe-group"", for the russe-celebration all seniors go through to celebrate graduating in Norway. During the time before the official celebration starts, people gather in groups and create logos, sweaters and songs. We also change names for the groups, and since we don't have enough money to buy new logos and stuff for every change, we figured we could use an old one from last year. Thanks to anyone who can help!! :D",2016-10-15 23:21:16+00:00,d8tnd2t,1,t3_57opvp,12,shittypicrequests
