This is how I would use it in my posts. Do you see the 'serial' value? Anything between each exclamation point gets split.. It reads, for any td with 'cell value', update the following td with that value. Do you see the ""justno""? That filters out entire &lt;tr&gt; elements where the first td has a title containing any word between each comma.  
**[check aNum=""some number"" lskeyword=""keywords to search for"" serial=""cell value!updated value!Oct 13, 2016"" platform=""platform name"" justno=""bad title1, bad title2""]**

So basically I want it to display the columns and rows accurately, like the default CSV reader on my system can as shown in the screenshot.

The most recent one I tried: **df=pd.read_csv('reddit.csv',delim_whitespace=True,header=None,delimiter=r""\s+"", encoding='utf-16')**  
*Keyword* should be a column name, not ever a row's value. The output given with that is here: http://pastebin.com/SdqGMWJL   

###edit  
It looks like the problem is all sorted out now. Some useful snippets for basic selection and sorting. I don't like the official docs for pandas.  

    #select two specific columns
    df1 = data[['Keyword', 'Avg. Monthly Searches']]
    
    #filter where a value must meet a criteria  
    df1[df1['Avg. Monthly Searches'] &lt; 90]
    
    #get first 3 rows
    df1[:3]

    #rename columns
    data.rename(columns={'Currency': 'Kurrency'}, inplace=True)
    
    #write back to csv
    df.to_csv(file_name)

    #multiple conditions / search for string
    df1[(df1['Keyword'].str.contains('string')) &amp; (df1['Avg. Monthly Searches'] &gt; 2000)]
    

When using that file again as a dataset if you write back to CSV, maybe let it be as simple as this or there might be an error:

I tried having just the dependency in there, but *mvn package* still expects a project tag... now it's malformed either way. Nothing is good enough for it. I can learn more about using Maven later on but I would have thought that using it to download and use a Java library would be pretty simple. Maven and Gradle were meant to simplify things, weren't they?  
By the way, this pom.xml is in the same folder as the Java file(s) which I want to use this library... that's the way it should be, right?  
###Update  
Even though [this example](http://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/example-list-links) was taken right from this library's website, it gives me these errors, even after the mvn command appeared to be successful this time by downloading *something*... dammit, including the jSoup dependency inside of this doesn't mean it built the jar.

####All I did was rename the variables inside of the short code to ones that are all lower case. I wouldn't have expected that to be a requirement at all. I started testing it out by having it echo whatever string I define in the short code, and then it came to me..  


I copied the structure of the older one below, and both load the same PHP file sitting on my server.   

    function check($atts) {
    
       extract(shortcode_atts(array(
          'word' =&gt; NULL,
          'another' =&gt; NULL,
          
       ), $atts));
      require_once('folder/_file.php');
     
    }
    add_shortcode('check', 'checkIt');  
I decided to access this file directly, set the variables inside of there, then load it inside of WP with the shortcode. My shortcode can process the whole PHP file, but what else I put inside of the short code besides the name, has no impact.  

    [checkNew newVar=""some string"" newVar2=""yeah....""]  
So, the PHP file starts like this:  

    if ( (!isset($word)) AND (!isset($another)) ) {
        echo ""There was an error."";
        exit();
    }  
The older short code, and new one can set those fine. At a point in the script, where it checks if the new variables are to be set, it looks like this:  

    if( (isset($newVar)) AND (isset($newVar2)) ){  
    // more code 
    }  
This just doesn't make any sense at all. It's not some syntax problem in my PHP files, because like I said my WP site can even process the whole entire script after I set those directly in the file. I just need my short code to do it for me, any time I include it in a blog post. This probably isn't even necessary but I'll just paste the new shortcode function while I'm at it.  

    function checkItNew($atts) {
    
       extract(shortcode_atts(array(
           'word' =&gt; NULL,
           'another' =&gt; NULL,

My questions come after the code.

    if not os.path.isfile(""posts_replied_to.txt""):
    	posts_replied_to = []
    
    else:
    	with open(""posts_replied_to.txt"", ""r"") as f:
    		posts_replied_to = f.read()
    		posts_replied_to = posts_replied_to.split(""\n"")
    		posts_replied_to = filter(None, posts_replied_to)
    
    subreddit = r.get_subreddit('pythonforengineers')
    for submission in subreddit.get_hot(limit=20):
    
    	if submission.id not in posts_replied_to:
    
    		if re.search(""love python"", submission.title, re.IGNORECASE):
    
    			submission.add_comment(""Python loves you too."")
    			print ""bot replying to : "", submission.title
    
    			posts_replied_to.append(submission.id)
    
    with open(""posts_replied_to.txt"", ""w"") as f:
    	for post_id in posts_replied_to:
    		f.write(post_id + ""\n"")

If the username and password are in config_bot.py, what would the ""check in"" process be like, so that not everyone can supposedly end up seeing that?  

I don't think it's a good practice to just have the submission ID's sitting in a text file, unless you're just testing it out. Would a sqlite3 DB work well for this? How about a CSV? Would much of the syntax in the code need to change if you switched it to that?  

In this example, the /r/pythonforengineers sub is the one that your bot would reply to. If you want your bot to reply to multiple subs, would you just put those names in an array, and then the name of the array in it's place?  

Once I've got a bot running, I'd like to reply to comments at some point. I like how the reddit bot example I posted above provides you with a good skeleton to get your feet wet. This code snippet, taken from the Praw docs shows you how to do that.  
import praw

    r = praw.Reddit('Comment Scraper 1.0 by u/_Daimon_ see '
                    'https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/'
                    'pages/comment_parsing.html')
    r.login('bot_username', 'bot_password')
    submission = r.get_submission(submission_id='11v36o')
    flat_comments = praw.helpers.flatten_tree(submission.comments)
    already_done = set()
    for comment in flat_comments:
        if comment.body == ""Hello"" and comment.id not in already_done:
            comment.reply(' world!')
            already_done.add(comment.id)  
The docs only show you the basics of getting it done, but it goes back to my first question.. is it bad to have your username and password right in the code, for any project, even if you're the only one that uses your computer. I remember reading something about people being able to find it. It looks like the above code snippet could basically just replace part of the aforementioned code.

The few different courses on C that I've dabbled in don't seem to offer many practical uses for it, comparing to python- they were purely just how-to's.

JavaScript probably wouldn't be a good way to handle this at all, because search engines probably still have limited capabilities when it comes to reading JS. That's only an example of why you shouldn't always use JS, just because it's possible to do so. There might be times I don't even want one of my older ways of doing something to show up in the source code (which JS doesn't really impact.)  
This would appear to get the job done: https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-and-replace/   
Have any of you ever had a need like this? I don't know if the content you put into blog posts in WP is wrapped in PHP tags. (is it standalone HTML?) If not, I don't see how finding and replacing anything could work.  
  
As I think about this a little more... whatever code is run to automatically add / delete / replace strings, would probably need to be code that is just run once. The less code you have running when the page loads, the better. It could get to be too inefficient if the same code is just replacing what you want to change, every time. (at least, it's bad practice)   
  
**edit** This plugin actually does what I want it to do, I decided to install it and give it a shot. It could be a fairly dangerous plugin though, because once you find and replace something, you can't undo it. So if you make a typo, you'll have to know this right away and try to come up with a find/replace to fix it afterwards. That, and I still don't know if this plugin is capable of making any errors. It's good that you can narrow down your searching and replacing to the field you want in the DB (title, content, tags, etc) but it looks like you can't go further than that (eg.- last 5 posts).

I think some analytics programs even provide you with an image to embed on your site, as an option if JavaScript isn't enabled.  
If you lazy load your images, could that prevent these external sites who host your images, from seeing your source of traffic?  
I've noticed that when someone clicks a shortened link to get to my site, my analytics programs usually won't say that a user came from a shortened link, but the site that the shortened link was on. Depending on the short link provider, it may just show the URL of the short link as the source of traffic. Is this probably intentional (did they probably strip referrer information?) Or, could it more likely be the amount of time it took for that shortened link to redirect to your site.
