I wasn't in a position to help... but it did get me thinking. I took first aid courses for my lifeguard requirements and cadets training... but that was a while back, and I'm in a different country now (South Korea).  If things had been different, and I had been on the sidewalks just as the person fell... could I have helped that person and not have to worry about legal consequences later on?  I remember first aid training putting a lot of emphasis on my rights and responsibilities (in Canada), and a big part of that was not to attempt things that I wasn't qualified for (eg don't try to use the defibrillator or airway tubes if you aren't specifically trained to use it, may do more harm than good).  And it's been a while... I am not sure if I can properly provide the help a person may need before an ambulance arrives at my current state.

Sorry for the ramble. I think I'm asking 2 questions here.

1) Legally(/morally) speaking, does an outdated certificate make me an 'untrained bystander'?  Meaning I shouldn't try anything risky like CPR in lieu of treating for shock and comforting the person?  Or am I still free to provide assistance to the best of my abilities at the time?

2) Practically speaking... am I a danger to the person if I try to provide help without being 'in practice'? If yes, what's the point of all those 'public service announcements' and 'raising civil awareness' campaigns? If not, what's the point of getting my certificates renewed?

Maybe this isn't the most suitable sub to ask, but I am 'too afraid to ask' this question anywhere else.  Any insight would be much appreciated.
