Yes. So much yes.

As for close family members, they're all messed up codependents or narcissists too. Everyone was either more interested in themselves or were too overwhelmed with their own situation. 

I let it go because we are all flawed human beings. As an outsider (family or otherwise), it's tough to know the extent of the abuse.

Yes, she thinks therapy is for weak people.

Probably. Maybe she considers that she's abnormal but rejects it so she won't paint herself black?

I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult. I really wish I had known earlier so I could get treatment. I know it can be difficult for kids to handle a negative label. Sometimes they feel like they're broken. I know you will do your best to help your child with whatever issues he may face but I encourage you to think about how you plan to talk about it with him.

I stopped sharing anything personal with her in my early teens. I wanted to get out of the house so badly. I didn't want to leave my sibling behind. I thought things improved as we became more financially independent and moved out. Nothing really changed. We just weren't around as much. 

I thought she was just an alcoholic. She is but that didn't explain all of her behavior. It wasn't until this summer that my therapist suggested that she might have BPD. Learning about BPD made me feel like I could salvage some superficial relationship with her. Out of pity? Guilt? I don't know. I felt like I had a new window of hope to get the mother I never had if she did DBT.

I packed my bags and left this Christmas without saying goodbye. She woke to find me gone. She had raged over nothing the night before and tried to pick fights with me as soon as I arrived. I waited until she was asleep to leave because I thought she might attack me. 

It was clear that nothing had improved from boundary setting, medium chill, or any other strategies I had been using for months. I laid out my issues in emails. I hoped I might get through to her so she would go to therapy, make changes, and try to make amends. She wouldn't even acknowledge her behavior (see my No Contact Playbook post).

Forgiveness was meant to help someone recognize that he/she suffered but not let that pain define his/her life. I was moved by her journey. I couldn't imagine ever forgiving someone like that.

62,"I completely agree with you. I don't know what BPD treatment (DBT or otherwise) includes. Are you saying that therapists ask BPDs to acknowledge that even if they were victims as children that does not prevent them from repeating the abuse? Or, that being a victim doesn't excuse their abuse? Or both? I don't know how DBT works but I would love to hear my mother acknowledge her abuse, recognize that she's repeating the cycle, and say that it's not okay. No matter who you are, you are not responsible for how you were raised but you are responsible for your actions as an adult. 

It seems like there is a lot more sympathy for BPDs compared to other cluster B's. Maybe that's because the mental health community sees mostly inward focusing BPDs and a history of abuse in childhood is common? Regardless, I completely understand your irritation about validation. It's hard to care about validation for BPDs given the invalidating nature of our childhood with them. I think it's interesting from a prevention perspective. It's easier to prevent a problem than try to fix it later. The onus is on the parents while their child is underage then it's on them when they're an adult.

I have to admit that some of the abuse I've experienced probably sounds absurd, especially if I put it all down in a list. I think I know what you mean about the group BPD though.

For those with children:

&gt; **My kid(s) are okay because she doesn’t yell at them.** Witnessing physical and emotional abuse is harmful to children, even when they’re not being targeted. Just because your wife/girlfriend isn’t currently attacking your children doesn’t mean it’s not affecting them. We learn about relationships from our parents and other caregivers.

&gt; What do you think your children are learning by observing mom’s and dad’s relationship dynamic? If you could choose a relationship partner for your children when they’re grown up, would you want it to be like your relationship with their mother? By staying in the relationship, you’re telegraphing that it’s okay for the person who “loves” you to abuse you and that one individual’s needs and feelings are more important than the other’s. Additionally, when and if the children ever begin to assert their own identities and challenge mom in any way—that is if they’re not terrified to do so after witnessing the way mom treats dad—they’ll typically be subject to the same hot and cold abuse.

I was doing a lot for my mother. I was bending over backward and giving whatever time I could spare. I realized that when she didn't acknowledge any of my sacrifice and minimized my help that nothing would ever satisfy her. I stopped giving and helping except for what I wanted to do.

She's actually a mean Witch but shifts blame away. She can't handle criticism or perceived criticism. She's also a perfectionist that rages when her expectations are not met. I wonder if that's more Queen-like than Hermit-like?

Father - King/Fisherman depending on the situation. When things were going well in their relationship, he was a King. I think she had some perverse pleasure in dominating, controlling, and demeaning him when she felt he wronged her. Maybe he was just a King but let things go to make life easier for himself? He never really protected his kids but maybe that was selfishness from NPD or ASPD rather than fear.

Me - I'm coming to terms with the idea that she may never be willing to participate in treatment. I knew a long time ago that there was nothing I could do to prevent the rages.

- *I learned that the best time to go NC is between twenty years ago and yesterday. Second best is right now.*

I'm LC now, almost NC, but I always tried to ""get by"". I would tell myself I just need to get through one more year, holiday, day... I'm done trying to placate her just to put off an inevitable rage.

- *she'd throw tantrums about the amount of time she was allowed to ""have us.""*

Yes, this is something that I've struggled with for years. She was even controlling about me spending time with friends on the weekends as a kid. Once I moved away and visited less frequently, it was all about what was ""fair"". When I told her that my in-laws would like to see more of me, she started demanding to spend more time with my husband because it wasn't ""fair"". She was just being petty.

- *I never want to stay with her for more than two days, because she'll invariable have a huge blow-up on the third day.*

Like fish and houseguests, BPDs begin to really stink after 3 days. I think my mom can hold it together for short periods but her true self seeps out pretty quickly. I was really fortunate this holiday when she picked a fight as soon as I arrived.

**Edit:** Make that four things...

- *Whenever we're with her, we can't relax for a moment, we're always waiting for the bomb to drop, there's not a minute we can let our guard down, because the smallest bit of information she'll get out of us in small talk, she'll later try to twist and turn into ammunition to destroy someone else's relationship.*

100,"I think you gave wonderful advice. I'm sorry that u/clusterbfamily and her partner broke up but I think it is still useful advice for the future. I've experienced some of the same issues in my relationship with my husband. I just want to add some of my thoughts in case it helps someone.

&gt; You just have to decide to stop, no matter what you're feeling or how many excuses your brain wants to come up with about how this one time you're justified, or you feel bad or depressed, or whatever. And, if you can't stop, remove yourself until you can.

I've gotten better (with CBT) to recognize it before I hurt his feelings but I still struggle. When I recognize it, I take a minute to reflect on what happened and calm down. I apologize then explain what I was thinking. I talk through the unhealthy thinking, behavior, etc. with him so he understands that it was my fault and unacceptable. We discuss better ways to communicate and avoid it in the future. We reiterate our good intentions, apologize for own transgressions, and reaffirm our commitment and love for one another. It is all meant to be positive, action-focused problem-solving. We want to take responsibility for our own actions, emotions, and words.

&gt; I'm lucky in the sense that my husband is an incredibly stable person so I didn't really have to deal with much from his end. We have a no-yelling policy and I recommend it. If your boyfriend has ""fleas"" too I think counseling would be helpful because it's hard enough dealing with your own fleas, let alone your partner's at the same time during a conflict.

I'm lucky in that my husband is stable as well but he has some codependent/rescuer tendencies himself. We're both working on having a healthier and happier marriage. Once he was passive aggressive with me by rolling his eyes and leaving the room after I sincerely apologized for hurting his feelings and being insensitive. I completely shut down crying. It triggered an emotional reaction in me that I had not experienced since I was a little kid. I was done. I couldn't look at him. I felt like our relationship was over. I couldn't handle the situation. We worked it out quickly by essentially going through the process I mentioned above. I think having policies that protect your sense of well-being are very important.

132,"Very well said.  My mother is less inward acting and more outward acting with verbal abuse (rarely physical) but she would make her emotions our responsibility. We ""made"" her mad or sad or whatever she couldn't cope with at the time. 

&gt;there was no other thought in my mind that it was somehow my fault

No matter what the situation, children are keen observers and want their parents to be happy. It is deeply upsetting to a child to see a parent so distressed. Children of BPD parents will change their behavior to try to make their parents happy and get rewarded for making their parents feel like they are ""good"" parents. It's an unintentional emotional manipulation that creates codependent children. It really clicked for me when I watched this video.

Why not start now because it bothers you now. Speak up when she's doing it. Be immune to her guilts and false apologies. Raise the bar for acceptable behavior with you. If she doesn't respond appropriately then end the conversation, leave the room, etc.

At the end of the day, you will never be okay with leaving your child alone with her. Maybe you don't want to have a relationship with her regardless of obligations? That's fine. Why do you owe them?

But I also feel like she is preventing me from living my own life to the fullest because, despite miles of distance, she is contacting me so frequently and in such negative and psychotic ways.

I can relate to this. I've started structuring contact and setting up boundaries. Don't answer or return calls when you're socializing with other people. Don't answer after a certain time of night. Don't continue with a conversation when it is getting negative. Go on an information diet. Use grey rock strategies.

147,"Okay, I don't know what it is like to be in your shoes because my uBPD mom can support herself and my dad is worthless.

BUT! This reminds me of my mother's situation with my grandparents. Her dad denied that her mother had any problems. He chose to support his wife and believe her side of things when my mother was being treated poorly as an adult. My mother cut them off because she didn't want them to hurt her children. My grandparents lived a very lonely and isolated life. My grandfather would sneak away from her to drop by to visit us unannounced every few years. I think he knew he made a mistake by letting his wife keep him from his family. I'm sure he felt ""in sickness and in health"" meant that he couldn't leave her and he was probably codependent in some ways as well. She was always ""sick"" and he probably thought that she couldn't live without him. He died never reuniting or making peace with his family. 

Please do what you can to be honest with your dad. If you want to have a relationship with him and it puts him in an awkward place with your mom then that is for him to figure out. He may feel guilty (and probably should) because he doesn't want to think you're so unhappy and unable to have a relationship with your mom. He already knows that you're struggling too but probably tries to minimize it in his mind.

He needs to know what is important to you and how you feel. This is an opportunity to establish a healthier life and relationships for yourself. You will both feel better knowing where the other person stands and how you plan to deal with things going forward. It's better to know than live with regrets of wondering ""what if"".

My parent's didn't divorce until I was an adult. My dad was neglectful and messed up in his own way so divorcing would not have been any better for my situation. 

If you divorce, the kids will likely be alone with her more but you can't be there all the time anyway and your time is spent modeling unhealthy behaviors in a relationship. 

Weekdays with you may not be better for the kids. How many hours would they spend with her each day after accounting for school, commuting, and after-school activities? Yes, it would be positive to see them more days a week but I wonder how the hours would actually break down.

158,"Adult child of uBPD mom here so know I take these issues very seriously and advocate the most for the kids. You choose to be in a relationship/marriage with your wife as a consenting adult capable of being independent and leaving the situation. Your children are dependent on you and your wife for everything. The situation is very different for them than a BPDSO.

&gt;  At this point I've had enough

I would argue that you're not saving your kids or protecting them. You're all victims to the whims of your wife. You only spoke up after she gaslit and invalidated your two children. Granted, you did speak up and you told your oldest that it wasn't her fault. Those are both positive decisions.

You need to work on yourself in therapy to become less codependent and more assertive for yourself and your children. Children can't make and keep boundaries the way adults can. You need to set boundaries for your kids. 

You have two bright, young children that are trying to understand what is going on and trying to behave in way that avoids any lashing out from your wife or fighting between you two. Please take the time to explain to them both what happened in age appropriate terms. Explain the ""logical"" reasons why your wife was upset over trivial matters and make absolutely clear that what she said is never okay. It is never okay for her to put your kids down. It is her job to communicate what she wants or needs rather than expect them to know. 

I would say something like this: 

*Accidents happen. It's okay that you spilled the soda. You did a good job by helping clean up. [Explain the idea of bleaching white fabrics and being unable to bleach colored fabrics] Your mom should have explained why you should use white towels to clean it up. You didn't know and that's okay. How your mom talked to you was not okay. She should never say things like that. You're very smart and you're learning new things every day becoming even smarter!*

*You did what you thought was best when you gave your sister a half sheet of paper towel just the way you would for yourself. There's nothing wrong with doing something differently from what your mom expects. If she thought it would be best to use a whole sheet then she should have said so. Don't be afraid to say what you think or how you feel. You are not responsible for mom's feelings. It is not your fault if she gets upset. If you ever want to talk about something that happened with mom then I will always be there to talk to you about it.*

I'm a smart, well-educated, conscientious, respectful young woman with incredibly poor self-esteem. I may know that I am smart, capable, responsible, etc. but I don't feel that way about myself. I deeply fear and avoid asking for help or letting people down. It negatively impacts my work performance. I'm still trying to avoid disappointing anyone for fear of what? - I have no idea but it is deeply ingrained in me. 

I can't tell you what to do but I caution you to think that staying married will protect the children. Sure, your wife may have them 50% but if you're divorced then they have an opportunity to see a healthy relationship and marriage 50% of the time. Work on yourself. Remember the kids are not sheltered from her. Even if her anger is directed at you, they have to deal with the fallout as well. They may not develop BPD but they can have long term issues with anxiety, depression, etc. and/or pick a partner with PD traits.

170,"Thanks for sharing. I wonder why it is so common to see a burst in symptoms with the birth of the first child. My guess is that there are many factors such as pregnancy and giving birth (hormone and bodily changes), family dynamics (changing roles and responsibilities), expectations and fears (from their own upbringing and family history), and general stress (newborns and children bring more work/chaos). It also seems like many had children very early in the marriage so it may be due to perceived pressure from the commitment of marriage or the comfort of knowing that you're committed?

I imagine that a lot of the symptoms are there before pregnancy/birth but those symptoms are better managed with fewer stressors.

I struggle with this now. I try to manage the situation so I don't have more headaches later on. Maybe I'm wrong in thinking that it will be a headache? For example, my mom is mercurial at best so I try to reduce her interactions with my in-laws. They don't particularly like each other or have much in common so my mom tends to get antsy during get togethers. I know that my in-laws judge her but want to include her because she is part of my family. Meanwhile, she gets worked up over their lack of support for my husband and me and says she will let them know what she thinks. I just try to placate her enough to keep the peace for holidays with them.

&gt; she's bound to get upset over something, no matter what I say or do, so it doesn't matter. Being clear and up front has helped me step out of the manipulation dance she's doing.

You're right. My mom is bound to get upset over something. I will work on being more clear and up front. I know there will be fall out but maybe it will be better in the long run. I need to be ready for the subsequent guilt trips and fighting. There will be a bigger blow up in an effort to break my resolve (extinction burst).

I don't think I go into a care-taking role with her now but I can imagine feeling the need to do so if she became ill or injured. I am good (for now) about not actually helping her when she makes bad choices. I spent time talking with her about issues in an effort to help her learn to deal with her own problems which I think unintentionally rewarded creating problems with other people. I'm working on stepping outside the drama triangle.

I agree that the best thing to do is to direct her at treatment so she can care for herself. I have suggested therapy to her but she thinks it is for ""weak"" people so she would never do it. 

You're exactly right in that my talking to her about the downsides of getting a vacation home crosses from giving an opinion and advice initially to taking care of her through continuing the discussion. It's like she kept trying to convince me it was a good idea while I kept explaining why I disagreed. I should have just said, ""You know what I think.""

The whole concept that she has uBPD is new to me so I'm just starting to learn about boundary setting and other strategies. Thank you for reminding me that being direct is important. I unconsciously walk on eggshells because I don't want to argue. I know she would be upset if I said I don't plan to help her with maintaining a vacation home so she needs to know that it will be her responsibility. She would get mad and defensive because ""I wasn't talking about that so why would I bring it up?"" And, ""why would you not help with something that you get to use and enjoy as well?""

I live far away as well. I moved for professional reasons but the distance has been surprisingly helpful for reducing time and toxicity. I had always planned to move back but I'm happy being at a distance from her so I'm not so sure. 

My mother is an impulsive and compulsive shopper so she mostly just loses a bit of money constantly on stuff that she doesn't really need. Her tastes are becoming more expensive though so it adds up. I'm not sure if she's living within her means or not. I don't know if she knows either.

203,"Welcome to RBB! I'm sorry about what happened with RBN. I can't say that I've met many people with BPD. I think it's tough to know what is going on with someone unless you really get to know them. The only BPD I know is my mom and she is undiagnosed. My therapist suggested she might have BPD and I'm fairly certain that she could be diagnosed. 

My uBPD mom works in a typical business setting. I know she had issues with an old boss and doesn't have any more direct reports. She does her job well but probably doesn't work well with other colleagues. She's probably great with clients. She would never be able to work in a helping profession but she likes to think of herself as caring and nurturing.

You may be right when you suggest that caring professions may attract those with BPD. Again, I don't know how many I've met with BPD. My mom has the invisible BPD so I imagine it's really tough to identify others like her when her symptoms are most apparent at home. 

I do know that I am a fairly guarded person. I will respect anyone I meet until they give me reason not to respect them anymore but I am very slow to trust others. I know I'm leery of people that seem *off*. I avoid those that tend to be dramatic, immature, unable to cope. I will be there for those I care about if and whenever they need help but I don't want to be involved with people that are needy.

I think there is something to be said about putting ourselves out there in a way that attracts certain kinds of people or encourages people to act in particular ways with us.

I would caution the use of anxiety meds because they can be addictive and are best for only short term use.

My mom has very, very few people left in her life. She works so she sees people at work but has nearly no friends or family left. I feel a sense of duty (or maybe charity?) in trying to make a LC relationship work for now. I can see myself going NC but I would like to manage boundaries if possible.

I decided to reply with short, civil, and direct answers when his correspondence was civil. I only really said I wouldn't be at the memorial or funeral. I couldn't be around him at the time. 

I did send a condolence card because I felt it was the right thing to do. I also used it as an opportunity to say that he should honor my grandparent's wishes by treating me better and reiterating that I expected civility. I was more open to the opportunity of having a superficial LC relationship then. I have no hope for that now. I don't regret sending the card.

You have already sent an email so you could not send a card at all. If sending a card would make you feel good then that would be fine. Make sure that you're doing this because *you* want to do it.

226,"&gt; The consequences for my actions 

In some ways, this process is a normal part of parenting. Children learn from consequences that there is appropriate or inappropriate behavior, etc. The problem for a child of a parent with BPD is the consequences are often completely inappropriate and severe. I was a very well-behaved child because I learned to comply to avoid harsh punishments.

&gt; my uBPD mother's inconsistent perceptions of my slights against her even as a small child taught me that I need to care about things, care about hurting others because of what would, will, could happen to me in return.

Children should learn to care about not hurting others. Little kids need to learn to share, not say mean things, not hit people, and generally take responsibility for their actions. Again, the problem with BPD is you're made to feel responsible for the feelings of others. The inconsistent and overly sensitive perception of slights from a BPD parent make it impossible to learn how to avoid punishment. Hyper-vigilance starts to become the norm. 

Punishment only makes someone less likely to do an action again but it doesn't encourage the appropriate behavior. Slowly, kids of BPD parents start to withdraw because they get punished for everything but rarely receive rewards or encouragement. I was a really outgoing and friendly little kid. I became much more withdrawn and anxious as I got older. Like you, I turned inward as a shy and introverted child. My mom logically wanted me to be a social butterfly but in practice never ever wanted me to leave her so I was fairly isolated. 

&gt; I've never for a second meant to be hurtful towards her, except when I reached my breaking point as a teenager before moving out at 16.

I'm the same way. I know she felt I was mean or insensitive but I have never done anything intending to hurt her. I know I couldn't wait to leave by the time I was 16 but I was afraid of what would happen to me and my sibling. I thought it was bad but I worried that it could be worse. I hope you found a safe place to go at such a young age.

&gt; I was never anything but nice and civil towards her till a certain age, and even then there were only a handful or fewer points of me lashing out, yet I was and always had been a mean, spiteful and hateful person in her eyes.

I get split black and white, or at least I now recognize how she could flip her opinion of me so fast. It is true that in those black moments, I was the most terrible, hateful, mean, and worthless person. It was very upsetting for me but I knew some small thing set it off like my lack of being thoughtful *enough*. 

&gt; I think I have a tremendous amount of cognitive empathy. 

I think we had to learn and master it because of our environment. It would've been far worse if we didn't learn how to see our BPD parent's perspective. 

&gt; I am slowly learning affective empathy as I learn to open up as a person and, for the first time in my memory, feel emotions, feel connections with others.

This is wonderful. I'm really happy for you. Although I will admit, it makes me feel a bit jealous that I have not had the same experience. I am so completely open to my husband. I get a little upset when he is sad or mad because I want him to be happy but I tend to focus on how I can make him happy. This can be anything from a joke, helping him take a different perspective, encouraging him to talk about it, or take a walk. I think this reflects my upbringing. It didn't matter that I didn't feel for my mom. I just needed to fix it so it would stop being a problem. 

&gt; I believe that I have strong schizoid tendencies from my upbringing and am struggling and learning how to pull myself out of this lifelong social isolation. 

I found cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to really help me with my anxiety. It may help you as well. Thank you so much for sharing with me.",2015-10-22 14:33:21+00:00,cw8utw6,2,t1_cw88erl,54280,raisedbyborderlines
227,"Wow. I recommend start going to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). You have a lot to work out for yourself. You have a child. You need to pull it together for yourself and her. She needs you to help her. Like you said, you don't want to leave her to just be with her mom. Your spouse lacks the self-awareness that she has a problem, let alone BPD. Until she is acknowledges she needs help and goes to therapy, you will not see anything improve with her.

You have a classic codependent relationship where she has complete control and you feel like there is no way out. This probably happened slowly. Social isolation, financial dependence, lack of self-esteem, etc. until you feel that the only way you can survive is to stay in this abusive relationship. This is not true. You can have a different life.

I'm going with the assumption that you should get a divorce because you said you feel so desperate you think you would've ""eaten a bullet"". Therapy comes first so you have an outlet and emotional support. You may have trouble getting custody without financial stability. You could get spousal support in a divorce but it will take a long time and may not happen. You need to find a way to be independent from your spouse. You will want to find a job. You should consult with a lawyer long before trying to separate. You need to set up a good defense before she knows that you're planning to separate. She will come at you more than ever before.

Oh yes, I'm very vigilant in observing people when I feel they are in a position of power over me. I have problems with social performance anxiety so this is a particularly keen issue for me. I hate disappointing them and I worry that I won't do a good enough job. I think this anxiety comes off as being tense or maybe not liking someone even though that's not the case.

I guess I never felt the GC/SG labels really applied to my sibling and me. I'm a little older so I tried to protect him from our mother but sometimes I couldn't help and just made things worse. We definitely clung to each other for support because our parents were so messed up.

As adults, it's hard not to fall back into those roles even if the sibling is an adult able to make their own decisions. I try very hard to be a good sister to provide support and guidance but not be a parent. I know the older brother role lends itself to protecting little sisters too. I'm glad you're leaning toward letting her live her life. Remember that what you say and your opinion means a lot to her and that it carries a lot of weight. Use the influence sparingly or it may be something she could grow to resent. I'm not saying you're going that direction but it was something I worried about myself.

I'm glad your sister found new family in her friend's families. I think this is a big takeaway for those RBN. Friends are the family you choose for yourself. Good luck building your life! ",2015-10-20 15:38:07+00:00,cw6gi1i,3,t1_cw6aygl,10044,raisedbynarcissists

I talked about this with my husband after posting. He said he has seen a change over the years. He thinks I became emotionally distant empathetically to prevent burnout. Unlike you, I don't become emotionally empathetic for anyone I love or care about. My husband said that I can be a bit cold because I don't have emotional empathy but knows that I am compassionate and at least cognitively empathetic. I wish I could be emotionally empathetic but it's like I don't have it in me.

I would say that I'm a bleeding heart that really cares about people so I am cognitively empathetic and compassionate to everyone (even my abusive mother). I know what you mean when you say that you are respectful to others but don't have empathy for them.

260,"Boundaries are not always physical. You can have emotional and personal boundaries. These are boundaries you set for yourself. B cluster personality disordered people tend to push boundaries and become enmeshed. This is not healthy. You need to communicate that you are keeping your current job. You will not take a new job. If you want to take the job then that's fine but that's different.

**Setting Boundaries**

To set boundaries, first we need to learn to communicate without blaming. In other words, stop saying things like: you make me so angry; you hurt me; you make me crazy; how could you do that to me after all I have done for you; etc. These are the very types of messages we got in childhood that have so warped our perspective on our own emotional process.  Instead use “I statements”: “I feel frustrated/angry when you ________ or when xyz happens”.  

Along with good communication, is honesty. Learn to say how you feel. Beating around the bush will not help you or your relationship in the long run.

It is impossible to set boundaries without setting consequences. If you are setting boundaries in a relationship, and you are not yet at a point where you are ready to leave the relationship then don't say that you will leave. Never state something that you are not willing to follow through with. To set boundaries and not enforce them just gives the other person an excuse to continue in the same old behavior. For example: “If you call me names I will confront you about your behavior each and every time and will share my feelings with you. I will not tolerate verbal abuse. If you continue this behavior, I will weigh my options, including leaving this relationship. I do not deserve this and I will not put up with it any longer”.

“If you continue to break your plans with me by not showing up or calling me at the last minute to cancel, I will confront you about this behavior and share my feelings. If this behavior continues, I will consider it to mean that you do not respect me or this relationship and I will have no contact with you for a month, until we can both evaluate and figure out our priorities. If I chose to get back in touch with you, and the behavior continues, we will no longer be in any type of relationship together”.

“When I ask you what is wrong, and you say “nothing”, but then proceed to slam doors or kick the wall, and seem to be angry, I feel angry or frustrated  that you refuse to communicate properly with me as if I am supposed to read your mind. If something is bothering you, I will trust you to let me know after you have spent some time cooling off alone. If you continue to punish me with your silence or fits, I will tell you how it makes me feel. If this behavior continues, I will weigh my options for this relationship. I do not deserve this type of behavior and will not put up with it any longer”.

Setting boundaries is not about making threats. It is about giving them choices and then consequences for the poor decisions they make, much like we do with our parenting skills. We cannot be in a healthy relationship without appropriate boundaries.

Yes, this happens. She's an adult so you can't control what she says or not (even if she is lying). Unfortunately, some people lie about really terrible things. You staying with her or breaking up with her won't prevent her from (or cause her to) telling friends lies.

Yes, I agree that you would need to be diagnosed by a professional.

Every relationship has two people so both people are contributing to any problems. Are you upset because you don't want to be at fault at all? Do you feel that he is the only one at fault? Does he acknowledge his role in contributing to problems? Do you acknowledge your role in contributing to problems?

Self-diagnosis is a bad idea. I think it would make sense for each of you to separately seek therapy. If you are diagnosed with BPD, would you seek treatment (dialectical behavior therapy is recommended)?

271,"&gt; They told me that i should look out for myself first, and that I cannot control her.

Yes, you need to understand this. You can only be responsible for your own actions. You can't keep her from doing or saying anything. If she threatens to kill herself you need to call the appropriate resources. You can't save her and you don't have the training to help someone in crisis.

Yes, you need to be with your friends. You need to have boundaries. You have other things going on in your life (including the need to sleep) so you can't always be there. She will say how she feels and what she thinks to her friends. You can't control that either. 

There's nothing that you can do that will keep her from having any problems. She needs help. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is recommended for treating BPD as well as medications. You can support her efforts to seek treatment but you can't make her do that either.

That's such a crappy thing for her to do. I am not at all surprised by the results (and a bit happy that it didn't work out the way she wanted too). 

&gt; Half of it would seem unbelievable unless people had been there themselves.

Yes, I was raised to not talk about family problems so I didn't really share my stories until I left for college. I was really surprised that people were so shocked and appalled by my every day stories (not even the ridiculous events). I was even more surprised by how much support I received when they found out what was going on. It meant a lot to me.

&gt; My therapist had a mixed opinion on support online as well and saw things differently than what I did in that people were subject to a lot of anonymous and therefore unchecked as far as effectiveness, responsibility advice that could ultimately do more harm than good.

Yes, in abusive situations, it can even be life-threatening and bad advice can get people killed. A therapist worth their salt would not advocate for online forums in part because they are such a mixed bag. I think the larger subs like RBN are worse than more specific subs like this one and Raised by Borderlines. RBN is technically not specific to narcissists but open to cluster Bs like borderline too. Unfortunately, these subs are smaller so there are fewer people to contribute but fortunately, the advice is generally very good. People on these BPD support subreddits tend to give very good suggestions about getting therapy, seeking legal advice, and reading books. Individuals with BPD are not likely to seek a diagnosis or share that information with loved ones so there may be many more people that could benefit from coming here but they don't know what they're dealing with. My therapist just suggested my mom might have BPD a few months ago. I took psychology classes but I never put it together because she is high functioning. I spent the last decade and a half trying to understand her and assuming it was alcoholism and individual differences. It helps to put a name on it and address the issues with strategies that work.

I'm really glad that your dad had a positive influence on you and got you out and into the world. My dad was pretty self-involved and would throw his kids under the bus to save his own skin. Child care providers positively influenced my sibling and me while my uBPD mom expected us to be independent so she could then depend on us. Like you, I feel we turned out okay.

276,"As an adult child of a likely uBPD mom, I see Raised by Narcissists as a place I would have sought help from as a teen. I did not have access to therapy, I didn't know why my parents had those problems, I was dependent on them and felt trapped. It's really hard to even become independent and get out of that environment because of the way you're raised. Those parents steal their kids money either by guilt or just stealing because the kids don't know how to set up a bank account. They can make their home life so stressful because of the constant threat to take away resources the kids need to work or go to school. Those parents talk down to their kids so they have no sense of self-esteem. They parentify so the kids don't even have a sense of self. Those parents may sabotage their kids relationships with other family, friends, or coworkers. Those kids are often victims of insidious emotional abuse that is very hard to describe to someone when you don't have the vocabulary of abuse from sources like Out of the FOG. 

I completely, 100% know what you mean about those subs being sympathy pits. I know that some of those posters are looking for attention while some are looking for an outlet because they don't have options or don't realize they have options.

I have far more sympathy for children of cluster B parents than the adults that choose to be in relationships with cluster B partners. You can walk away as an adult. You can get a divorce or break up but if you're a kid (hell, even a young 20 something without a lot of support or resources) then you're in a very different situation. 

I upvoted your comment but I would bet that a fair few downvoted you because there are lots of reasons why a sympathy pit isn't the worst thing. The worst is being isolated, without support, without knowledge or access to resources, in an abusive relationship from which there seems to be no escape.

Adult children are messed up too and we often seek messed up relationships as adults because of how we were raised and coped. We are not responsible for the way we were raised but we are responsible for our actions as adults. Not defending any bullshitters on any of the support subs but I'm willing to bet that they're ""adult children of"" like my uBPD mom. She didn't have a name for her parent's behavior and she didn't have the internet to find resources. She's messed up and she hurt her kids.

284,"&gt; I was supposed to be mom's best friend, her mother, her therapist, her punching bag, and her spouse when she wasn't feeling it with her husband. 

Being parentified is a terrible form of abuse. I didn't have a name for this until fairly recently when I noticed it on Out of the FOG. 

&gt; When I went NC 3 years ago I felt like a computer that had deleted its operating system. Who am I? What do I like and dislike? I was so enmeshed

I was really fortunate to break away (somewhat) when I was a teen and started dating. I realized that when I was with my boyfriend that I didn't know what *I* wanted to do because we (as a family) always did what she wanted to do. I started exploring my sense of self as a teen. It caused a lot of problems through high school, college, and as long as she had anything to hold over me. Things became so much better once I was financially independent and lived away from her. I'm low contact but I can relate so much to your experience. I'm really sad that you didn't get to break away sooner but so happy that you did break away. You have come so far.

289,"Well, I think I could've gone no contact years ago after a really big fight but I knew that would put an inordinate amount of pressure and stress on my sibling who was dependent on financial support for college. I only found out that she likely has BPD when my therapist suggested it a few months ago.

I've kept low contact (phone calls about 1x per week, visit for holidays, birthday, etc.) because my mom is very much alone. She doesn't have many friends (only acquaintances or casual friends) and no family (passed away and never close to extended family). I would feel very guilty if I didn't try to have a healthy relationship with her. I say that not because of how she would guilt me but because I know she is a broken person that needs some support. It doesn't make everything she does or says okay but it doesn't make the good things she has done for me disappear either. 

I give her as much support and as much of a relationship as I feel is healthy or appropriate. My relationship with her improved immeasurably by being independent from her both geographically and financially. Most of the issues come up because of her need to control and differing expectations. 

I don't blame anyone for ""ghosting"" or going ""no contact"". I think it is necessary and the best option for some people.

293,"&gt; they rewrite whole conversations, even if there is evidence to the contrary. They really believe this stuff because their strong emotions are so disconnected from reality, they can't reconcile both, and their brain revises their perceptions.

This adds to the gas lighting because they don't even recognize that they're rewriting events in the moment. Their perception, and therefore memories, are immediately distorted. 

If I had BPD this would be the most horrifying part to me. *I can't trust my own perceptions or memories? What's real and what did I make up? Who can I trust to tell me the truth?* This is made even worse because the person you had a fight with was likely the only person there to tell you what happened but your feelings and memories tell you that this person is wrong.

That's great! Congratulations!

I looked into BPD once my therapist suggested my mother may have it. She is undiagnosed, in denial about any problems, and thinks therapy is for ""weak"" people so I have no hope that she will seek therapy. I'm not in a romantic relationship with someone with BPD so I have explored strategies around boundaries, etc. to help keep the relationship healthier. 

You should discuss this issue with your therapist. Maybe talk to your SO about how much you would appreciate it if he would look at some of the resources because it would support your work in DBT. Maybe the book is too overwhelming and he could benefit from something slimmed down?

http://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ValidationandBPDNEApresentation.pdf

&gt; Q: What mistakes do you see loved ones make when trying to deal with someone with BPD?

Family members often try to encourage their loved one but inadvertently invalidate them and increase their emotional arousal. For example: the person with BPD says, “I am a terrible person” after seeing hospital bills from a suicide attempt. The family member responds, “No, you’re not a bad person.” The contradiction makes the person with borderline personality disorder more distressed.

Instead, try acknowledging the feelings/thoughts behind the statement then moving into something else. Say instead, “I know that you feel badly about how you acted and that makes you think you are a bad person.”

Another error is that family members give the person with BPD more care and attention when they are in crisis and then withdraw when they are not. This may inadvertently reinforce the crisis behavior and punish non-crisis behavior.

&gt; Q: You suggest using a technique called validation to help defuse a loved one’s intense emotions. What is validation, and how is it different from simply agreeing with what someone says?

Validation is a way of acknowledging some small piece of what the person says as understandable, sensible, “valid.” An important piece of validation that people miss is that we don’t validate the invalid. For example, if your loved one is 5’7,” weighs 80 pounds and says “I’m fat,” you wouldn’t validate that by saying, “Yes, you are fat.” That would be validating the invalid.

You can validate some part of what she is saying by saying “I know you feel fat (or bloated, or full)”, whatever is appropriate to the context of what she is saying. Try to find some small kernel of validity. Remember that tone and manner can be invalidating when words are validating. “I know you FEEL fat” can be invalidating because it communicates that the feeling is wrong.

You can also find a GP to refer you. You can use them to prescribe refills if you decide to use medication and once you figure out your dose, etc. with a psychiatrist or APRN.",2015-10-15 16:21:05+00:00,cw0ropu,3,t1_cw0rd5h,472,ADHD
300,"Oh boy... Yes, you need to focus. Having a slightly more specific direction would be helpful. You don't want to jump into going to school and acquiring debt or spending your savings without a direction or goal. You could take classes that interest you but end up not having enough credits in enough specific areas to even add up to a degree. You could jump into a major and switch, a lot, and not have a degree. Planning on using graduate school to fix a decision for undergrad when you haven't even picked a major is absurd. 

Advice:

- Don't start school until you have a plan. Know what classes you want to explore specifically for a major (2 or 3 options at most) before you sign up for any classes.

- Read some books at the library in areas of interest to you. See if you're actually interested or just superficially interested.

- Research career options in the areas of interest to you. (See https://www.onetonline.org/ or http://www.bls.gov/bls/occupation.htm and type in your occupation of interest for information about salary, education, skills, expected growth, etc.)

- Consider keeping your job (maybe there is tuition remission available?) in at least a part-time status while you explore options so you don't find yourself without a job and feeling lost in school.

- You will change your mind. You will change your plan. **You need a plan and a goal or else you will find yourself in trouble.** Be willing to explore but pick a direction and go with it. ",2015-10-15 16:12:07+00:00,cw0rbjz,1,t3_3ovceh,1123,ADHD

If you have untreated, underlying anxiety then stimulants can make that worse. **Would having more anxiety after taking concerta rule out ADHD? NO!** You may need to treat the anxiety with ADHD or treat it before trying stimulants.

If you have ADHD as an adult, methylphenidate may not treat your ADHD symptoms. **Would not having a relief in ADHD symptoms rule out ADHD? NO!** You may just need a different drug.

328,"&gt; She expressed some doubts about it saying it might stress her out too much (especially at this important time of being pregnant). I didn't want to push it any more or push her away from the idea so we pretty much left it like that.

I feel like it may be a good idea to start therapy now because having a new baby and a changing family is very stressful. She may be in a better place when the baby arrives if she has therapy beforehand. I imagine that when the baby does arrive that the additional responsibilities can be a real limitation, or an excuse, to not start therapy. It's a difficult subject to bring up though.

I think I was less lucky. He enabled and took the brunt of the storm when I was a little kid but redirected any anger away from him and onto his kids once we were a little older. I think there is something wrong with him. Maybe a personality disorder as well?

Same. I was always a good sport ready to go along with anything because any choices were always false choices. I still struggle to disagree with someone in professional settings when I have expertise to support my case.

Below are some tips for boundary setting. My mom likely has undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. Your mother may have another cluster B personality disorder but you may find the advice applicable.

How to set and reinforce healthy boundaries

Talk to your loved one about boundaries at a time when you’re both calm, not in the heat of an argument. Decide what behavior you will and will not tolerate from your loved one and make those expectations clear. For example, you may tell the borderline, “If you can’t talk to me without screaming abuse at me, I will walk out.”

- When setting limits, it can help to calmly reassure the person with BPD by saying something like, “I love you and I want our relationship to work but I can’t handle the stress caused by your behavior. I need you to make this change for me.”

- Everyone in the family needs to be in agreement on the boundaries—and how to enforce the consequences if they’re ignored.

- Think of setting boundaries as a process rather than a single event. Instead of hitting your loved one with a long list of boundaries all at once, introduce them gradually, one or two at a time.

- Avoid threats and ultimatums that you can’t follow through on. As is human nature, your loved one will inevitably test the limits you set. If you relent and don’t enforce the consequences, your loved one will know the boundary is meaningless and the negative behavior will continue. Ultimatums are a last resort (and again, you must be prepared to follow through).

- Don’t tolerate abusive behavior. No one should have to put up with verbal abuse or physical violence. Just because your loved one’s behavior is the result of a personality disorder, it doesn’t make the behavior any less real or any less damaging to you or other family members.

- Don’t enable by protecting the person with BPD from the consequences of his or her actions. If you’ve tried and failed and your loved one won’t respect your boundaries and continues to make you feel unsafe, then you may need to leave. It doesn’t mean you don’t love the person with BPD, but your self-care should always take priority.

359,"That sucks. I don't blame you because it is natural to want to explain and help someone else understand. It's terrible but there's nothing you can say that will make her understand.

360,"&gt; I was curious as to whether this is a common behaviour or something else entirely

It fits with the BPD characteristics of control and enmeshment. My mom would definitely expect or want a lot of attention but she can generally still mingle at parties. She is also very sensitive to perceived slights. She would still be very reactive if I were to say what you have outlined. Maybe you could get your brother to run interference and give her lots of attention on the day of the wedding so she has lots of company and reassurance even when you're not with her?",2015-10-09 19:20:02+00:00,cvu1394,3,t1_cvu00aw,1618,BPDlovedones

I know you feel anxious about the idea of her being upset and/or fighting on your wedding day. I don't see how you could say anything that would make her understand that wouldn't trigger her feeling like she's being rejected. My mom likely has uBPD. If I sent her a letter like the one you mention then she would blow up about how she isn't wanted at her own daughter's wedding. I think it is perfectly fine to ignore any shouting or name calling and let her storm off if she isn't happy on *your* wedding day. You can't control her behavior.

Studies show that therapy and behavior modification alone does not help much (obviously your strategies are not working), medication alone helps significantly more, the combination of medication and behavior modification is significantly better still. Top researchers like Dr. Russell Barkley advocate for patients to use medication because stimulants have the best effect for individuals with ADHD (better than other drugs for other disorders).

You can try a drug and stop if you don't like it or have side effects. Don't worry too much about the side effects. You just need to be aware so you could let you doctor know, stop taking it, change doses, and/or try a different medication. I was diagnosed recently in my late 20s and I tried vyvanse.

We may be victims but as we become adults we need to recognize our part in problems. Sometimes we contribute to it without recognizing it.

- Sometimes it helps to fake it until you make it. Try putting on a smile and starting up light conversations.

Light, positive, non-consequential are key here.

- Some people are gossips but most people care more about what is going on in their own lives. Being present tends to squash any need for anyone to say anything about you. It helps not to share personal information that you wouldn't feel comfortable with anyone knowing so there is nothing to gossip about.

410,"&gt; the difference between anxiety and ADHD? How da hell will I know?

A lot of your questions are around conditions that are often comorbid with ADHD. I recommend reading ""Driven to Distraction"" because there is a chapter that provides short descriptions of ADHD and anxiety, ADHD and autism spectrum disorders, ADHD and depression, etc. Sure, people can have more than two conditions but it will give you an overview. If you're really interested in learning about the distinctions between these disorders then I suggest reading a more advanced clinical psychology textbook focusing on diagnostics. This forum is based on individuals with ADHD and not experts in the field that help develop the DSM. 

To answer your question, you will not know if it's ADHD, anxiety, or anything else because we lack insight needed to clearly recognize our own behaviors, moods, etc. and the knowledge to differentiate between disorders. This is why a psychiatrist could not diagnose and treat him or herself. 

I was sure I had social anxiety related to work. I did cognitive behavioral therapy for months. My therapist suggested I might have ADHD once my anxiety was under control but I was still struggling. I blew it off because ""that's a disorder for hyperactive boys"". I saw one of Dr. Russell Barkley's videos about high functioning (and/or intelligent) individuals with ADHD and it clicked for me. Sometimes the best thing to do is to treat the comorbid anxiety or depression before introducing stimulants for treating ADHD. It becomes difficult for therapists to distinguish between the cause of an issue when it could be the result of anxiety, depression, etc.

I think you're trying too hard to make clear cut lines between disorders where there is overlap. The overlap is there because they have common symptoms. That's okay. Not everything fits neatly into distinct boxes. ",2015-10-07 12:58:37+00:00,cvr7gud,1,t3_3ntuwn,4825,ADHD

413,"I agree with the other posts here already. 

**If you're trying to make it work:** I would also suggest that you keep a regular schedule with leaving the house for time to focus on work. If you have a set schedule then it may make it easier for her to cope with the absence because she knows that you'll be gone. She probably feels both that you are leaving her and not helping while also feeling that you are not working enough. You know what you need to do for yourself and your job. 

**If you're open to change:** I suggest that you get a divorce. I saw in your previous post that your wife was a therapist and would not participate in therapy. She does not want to change.

They don't need the threat of instability from their mom telling them that you're leaving them every day. The kids are young so being a good mom is easier because she is in control. Problems with children increase as they become more autonomous. I'll be honest. Your comment about your wife on good days concerns me. Is ""fine, a good mom, very sexy, etc."" good enough for your life? Does it make all of the other stuff worth it? Is it really in the best interest for your kids to stay like this?

426,"I don't see how it is healthy or appropriate for your spouse to dictate whether or not you can see your therapist. That seems like a boundary you need to protect. 

As for couple's therapy, if your spouse wants it then that's fine but BPD usually means making it anyone else's responsibility for problems so that may go poorly. If your spouse would go to therapy (dialectical behavior therapy preferably) then there may be some hope to make changes. 

I would suggest therapy for the kids with a different therapist from your own. As you said, your spouse will not approve of them seeing your therapist and your therapist doesn't treat children or families. Maybe a family therapist would be a good idea for you and the kids? Your spouse can come too but the focus should be on doing what's best for the kids and family. 

As an adult child of a uBPD parent, it's really tough on the kids. I would suggest not trying to explain BPD or that their parent has BPD. I think that keeping it to ""he can't behave the way he does"" is important. The behavior, yelling, verbal abuse is unacceptable without qualifications or explanations. They need to know that. 

&gt; He understands this, but he loves his dad so much and can't stand to see him hurt.

It's important for them to understand that behaving that way isn't okay even if their dad is upset or hurt. They need to learn that they are not responsible for the feelings of others, it's not their job to get you to make up, and that they shouldn't be in the middle of any of this. It's very stressful as a child to think your parents may divorce and to witness fighting. I recommend creating a boundary with your kids that you will remove yourself and the children when he his yelling that way in the future. Talk to your therapist about options for managing with the kids.",2015-10-05 16:36:24+00:00,cvp1nfe,1,t3_3nl72g,1732,BPDlovedones

Well, maybe it works and maybe you have a diagnosis now because it doesn't work for you because you have ADHD and things work a bit differently for you. 

You are still you. Taking medication doesn't mean you're any less you or that you're broken. Medication helps bring us up to the bar so things are achievable. If you're like me, you'll be surprised how many benefits you receive from medication. I've discovered that things I thought were just my (negative) quirks are actually symptoms and features of ADHD. 

It's okay to reject the diagnosis for now. It's okay to not take medications. Give yourself time. You need to get a handle on what it means. I recommend books like ""Driven to Distraction"" or ""Taking Charge of Adult ADHD"". If or when you're ready, you can always try medication.

As I understand it, BPD reworks perceptions in real time so she does see it as not an overreaction or completely justified reaction. How do you help someone see it objectively when they can't? I recommend the resource below for helping someone with BPD for strategies. It seems like creating and keeping boundaries during those rages is the only thing that you can do.

I found learning to be in control of my own body and breath to be particularly helpful initially (breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation). Physical activities like yoga and tai chi can be therapeutic too. A lot of what CBT did for me was recognizing negative thinking and problematic behaviors so I could address them. 

I've had a lot of benefits for my mental health but also physical health too. I stopped having migraines and became sick less often because my stress levels are down.

435,"I look forward to seeing the answer you receive. I would suggest those conversations are better to have when not in an elevated state of anger, anxiety, etc. I think a lot of the strategies for BPD center around validating feelings. The link below has some great strategies for communication and reminders for self-care, etc.

http://www.helpguide.org/articles/personality-disorders/helping-someone-with-borderline-personality-disorder.htm

*Communication tips*

*It’s important to recognize when it’s safe to start a conversation. If your loved one is raging, verbally abusive, or making physical threats, now is not the time to talk. Better to calmly postpone the conversation by saying something like, “Let’s talk later when we’re both calm. I want to give you my full attention but that’s too hard for me to do right now.”*

*When things are calmer:*

- Listen actively and be sympathetic. Don’t let yourself be distracted by the TV, computer, or cell phone. Avoid interrupting or trying to redirect the conversation to your concerns. Set aside your judgment, withhold blame and criticism, and show your interest in what’s being said by nodding  occasionally or making small verbal comments like “yes” or “uh huh.” You don’t have to agree with what’s being said to make it clear that you’re listening and sympathetic.

- Focus on the emotions, not the words. The feelings of the person with BPD communicate much more than what the words he or she is using. People with BPD need validation and acknowledgement of the pain they’re struggling with. Listen to the emotion your loved one is trying to communicate without getting bogged down in attempting to reconcile the words being used.

- Do what you can to make the person with BPD feel heard. Don’t try to make them wrong, win the argument, or invalidate their feelings, even when what they’re saying is totally irrational.
Try to stay calm, even when the person with BPD is acting out. Avoid getting defensive in the face of accusations and criticisms, no matter how unfair they may be. Defending yourself will only make your loved one angrier. Walk away if you need to give yourself time and space to cool down.

- Seek to distract your loved one when emotions rise. Anything that draws your loved one’s attention can work, but distraction is most effective when the activity is also soothing. Try exercising, sipping hot tea, listening to music, grooming a pet, painting, gardening, or completing household chores.

- Talk about things other than the disorder. You and your loved one’s lives aren’t solely defined by the disorder, so make the time to explore and discuss other interests. Discussions about light subjects can help to diffuse the conflict between you and may encourage your loved one to discover new interests or resume old hobbies.",2015-10-05 13:36:24+00:00,cvovmi5,3,t1_cvouxo5,1556,BPDlovedones

&gt; Beware the one therapist who agrees with everything you say. Conversely, beware the therapist who thinks you must follow their advice no matter how much you disagree with it.

Great advice for anyone looking for a therapist for any reason! When my therapist doesn't agree, she doesn't say it outright but sort of explains another perspective. I really appreciate that given my upbringing with an uBPD mom that tries to control my feelings.

&gt; state your goals of therapy

Very important too! I think sometimes it is easy to lose focus on what your goals are for therapy in general. I sought help for anxiety related to work but when things are happening with my mom then it comes up during that session. I try to be careful not to let her dominate my sessions because I have my own problems to work on.

&gt; having close experience with BPD would necessarily keep her from helping you reach your therapy goals

I think that having a therapist that understands the B cluster personality disorders would be helpful. Some people (even therapists have biases) have trouble understanding the difficulties of the relationship with a BPD parent. Some of my interactions with my mom are extremely stressful because of the history and pattern of behavior that would otherwise be negligible with a typical parent.

Mindfulness, structuring time for error-checking, spell check (obviously), and even reading something aloud to see if it makes sense can all help. Sometimes it's better to find jobs or roles that play off of our strengths rather than ask us to make up for things that we will, likely, always struggle with. 

I found that vyvanse helped me with focusing on details a bit more so that may help you. I generally have changing tasks that are difficult to really measure for productivity so it's tough to say discretely how much medication helps in general.

I know that it's still in my system for a bit over 24 hours because I can feel it when I try to sleep sometimes. It's a good idea to establish good sleep habits because it can make sleeping an issue.

I feel like your next question would be about doses and titrating so... I was started on 20mg to get used to a stimulant and keep an eye out for side effects. I felt heart tingles (not quite palpitations) and had some off breathing patterns sometimes when I first started. I felt a difference right away with energy, didn't mindlessly snack or have food cravings, cleaned the house very thoroughly, but it didn't help my focus for work. My APRN said to try doubling it to 40mg a bit before my next appointment if it was going okay. It made a huge difference for work. I never felt like work was like pulling teeth but suddenly starting and sticking with work felt so much easier. It was almost like I had been struggling but didn't realize how hard until I had the meds to compare the difference (if any of that makes sense?). I still struggled to start and stick with some work that is more challenging and demanding so I asked if I could try bumping up the dose to 50mg. I regret it. I will go back to 40mg the next time I see him. I don't feel like I have any more benefits for work but the side effects are a little stronger, e.g. it seems to affect my sleep more.

&gt;So far actually helping her hasn't been the problem but just how she acts so entitled and demanding about it.

For my mom, I think she believes that if she didn't guilt trip and demand then I wouldn't do it. I really just want to be asked like a person so I can say ""sure, I would love to help"" and be able to help on my own terms (when it is convenient but still soon rather than that instant). I've tried to reword her request after she asks in a way that I would actually liked to be asked. Eg. ""If you're asking me if I could help with x, y, z, then yes, I would love to help with that."" She seems to recognize that I'm asking that she uses a different tact as long as I use a positive tone (not overly or false positive though).

I think that part of the issue with her being snappy with you (""Fix it then!"") might be because she feels like she's on the defensive. She doesn't have the skills or knowledge to manage the online portions of her business and needs help. I'm sure you don't mind helping and would prefer not to get money involved. It all comes back to talking to one another nicely and being respectful and appreciative.

I completely understand if you want a rant and complete support that she sucks (she kind of does... so does my mom) but I think you are trying to make things work. I think that the best way to change things is to model the change. Acknowledge her with kind words when she does something for you. Say you're welcome and I'm happy to help after doing something for her business. Maybe share that you're really amazed that she manages her business on her own and you know it's a lot of hard work? I know that's a bit of butt kissing but it's kind of true too. She will be appreciative (at least on some level).

I think it is really, really, incredibly hard to see that part that we play in our relationships with people we are close with. We fall into the same dynamics so quickly.

Let your doctor know about any other conditions you have currently. Make sure you bring a list of any current medications. Ask about costs/benefits of the options available - how long it lasts, side effects, how it affects moods, etc. What side effects require immediate attention or stopping the medication (chest pain, etc)? How should you take the medication prescribed - timing, with/without food? When and how will you re-evaluate progress or need to try a different dose or medication?

I recognize some of myself in what you said. I tend to have a freak out because I'm concerned that things are not being packed safely/securely or that we're running behind schedule. 

I don't have BPD but I wonder how much of that response is due to FLEAS, anxiety, being a conscientious woman? I am trying to be mindful about the way I am with my husband because I don't have a filter with him the way I do with everyone else. It's both a good and bad thing.

Are you creating consequences for breaking those boundaries such as removing yourself from the situation (ending the conversation, leaving the room, leaving the house)? 

A possible example for when your mother rants about your sister: You can acknowledge that your mother *feels* that your sister does not love the family enough and that she *wants* her to move back home with you. You can say that your sister is independent and has a job there and that she can have a life there and still love her family. If she continues to push then you can say that you are done talking about it and remove yourself.

606,"As an adult child of a BPD parent, I am happy to see that you are interested in helping your children with boundaries. I don't know the age of your children but I think any advice is dependent on their developmental level. I am going to assume from your questions that they are young.

I think it's important for you to remember that they are your children. I say that because you need to think about the dynamics of being completely and entirely dependent on your parents for your safety, security, food, home, love, everything. They will always have problems creating boundaries for themselves. They are dependent and in a position without equal footing or power to set consequences for your SO breaking boundaries. Your SO is in a position of power so they can tell your children what to do. Your children do not have that ability.

You are responsible for setting boundaries and protecting your children from any fury of your SO. Some boundaries could be that your SO can never take their fury out on the children, can never call them names, never put them down, never hit them, never threaten to take away things they depend on their parents providing, etc. If any of these boundaries are broken then your SO needs to leave or you need to take the kids and leave. BPD behavior is extremely damaging to children. It is extremely stressful. They need to know that they can count on you to always protect them. 

You should discuss these issues with your SO (and maybe a therapist). Your SO needs to know what is absolutely never okay. Obviously, boundaries should be set for issues beyond abuse. I was emotionally, verbally, and physically abused by my BPD parent so my thoughts go here as an absolute necessity. When children are young, they do not generally trigger their BPD parent because they want to comply but issues become worse as children age.

I suggest family therapy may be a good direction to help establish a healthy home environment before there are greater problems. Maybe in time, your children will learn what is and is not okay based on the boundaries that you set and defend for yourself. The transition to adulthood and independence will be difficult for your SO to manage.

Key advice, ""Talk to your loved one about boundaries at a time when you’re both calm, not in the heat of an argument.""

&gt; ""Setting healthy boundaries with a borderline loved one

&gt; One of the most effective ways to help a loved one with BPD gain control over his or her behavior is to set and enforce healthy limits or boundaries. Setting limits can help your loved one better deal with the outside world, where schools, work, and the legal system, for example, all set and enforce strict limits on what is and what is not acceptable behavior. Establishing boundaries in your relationship can replace the chaos and instability of your current situation with an important sense of structure and provide you with more choices about how to react when confronted by negative behavior. When both parties honor the boundaries, you’ll be able to build a sense of trust and respect between you, key ingredients for any meaningful relationship.

&gt; Setting boundaries is not a magic fix for a relationship, though. In fact, things may initially get worse before they get better. The person with BPD fears rejection and is sensitive to any perceived slight. This means that if you’ve never set boundaries in your relationship before, your loved one is likely to react badly when you start. If you back down in the face of your loved one’s rage or abuse, you’ll only be reinforcing his or her negative behavior and the cycle will continue. But remaining firm and standing by your decisions can be empowering to you, beneficial to your loved one, and ultimately transform your relationship.

&gt; How to set and reinforce healthy boundaries

&gt; Talk to your loved one about boundaries at a time when you’re both calm, not in the heat of an argument. Decide what behavior you will and will not tolerate from your loved one and make those expectations clear. For example, you may tell the borderline, “If you can’t talk to me without screaming abuse at me, I will walk out.”

&gt; - When setting limits, it can help to calmly reassure the person with BPD by saying something like, “I love you and I want our relationship to work but I can’t handle the stress caused by your behavior. I need you to make this change for me.”

&gt; - Everyone in the family needs to be in agreement on the boundaries—and how to enforce the consequences if they’re ignored.

&gt; - Think of setting boundaries as a process rather than a single event. Instead of hitting your loved one with a long list of boundaries all at once, introduce them gradually, one or two at a time.

&gt; - Avoid threats and ultimatums that you can’t follow through on. As is human nature, your loved one will inevitably test the limits you set. If you relent and don’t enforce the consequences, your loved one will know the boundary is meaningless and the negative behavior will continue. Ultimatums are a last resort (and again, you must be prepared to follow through).

&gt; - Don’t tolerate abusive behavior. No one should have to put up with verbal abuse or physical violence. Just because your loved one’s behavior is the result of a personality disorder, it doesn’t make the behavior any less real or any less damaging to you or other family members.
 
&gt; - Don’t enable by protecting the person with BPD from the consequences of his or her actions. If you’ve tried and failed and your loved one won’t respect your boundaries and continues to make you feel unsafe, then you may need to leave. It doesn’t mean you don’t love the person with BPD, but your self-care should always take priority.""",2015-09-16 16:57:06+00:00,cv3nt2d,1,t3_3l6rmq,2258,BPDlovedones

If you back down in the face of your loved one’s rage or abuse, you’ll only be reinforcing his or her negative behavior and the cycle will continue. But remaining firm and standing by your decisions can be empowering to you, beneficial to your loved one, and ultimately transform your relationship.

&gt; How to set and reinforce healthy boundaries

&gt; Talk to your loved one about boundaries at a time when you’re both calm, not in the heat of an argument. Decide what behavior you will and will not tolerate from your loved one and make those expectations clear. For example, you may tell the borderline, “If you can’t talk to me without screaming abuse at me, I will walk out.”

&gt; - When setting limits, it can help to calmly reassure the person with BPD by saying something like, “I love you and I want our relationship to work but I can’t handle the stress caused by your behavior. I need you to make this change for me.”

&gt; - Everyone in the family needs to be in agreement on the boundaries—and how to enforce the consequences if they’re ignored.

&gt; - Think of setting boundaries as a process rather than a single event. Instead of hitting your loved one with a long list of boundaries all at once, introduce them gradually, one or two at a time.

&gt; - Avoid threats and ultimatums that you can’t follow through on. As is human nature, your loved one will inevitably test the limits you set. If you relent and don’t enforce the consequences, your loved one will know the boundary is meaningless and the negative behavior will continue. Ultimatums are a last resort (and again, you must be prepared to follow through).

&gt; - Don’t tolerate abusive behavior. No one should have to put up with verbal abuse or physical violence. Just because your loved one’s behavior is the result of a personality disorder, it doesn’t make the behavior any less real or any less damaging to you or other family members.
 
&gt; - Don’t enable by protecting the person with BPD from the consequences of his or her actions. If you’ve tried and failed and your loved one won’t respect your boundaries and continues to make you feel unsafe, then you may need to leave. It doesn’t mean you don’t love the person with BPD, but your self-care should always take priority.""",2015-09-16 16:56:17+00:00,cv3nrv3,2,t1_cv2q5yq,74296,BPDlovedones

&gt; ""Setting healthy boundaries with a borderline loved one

&gt; One of the most effective ways to help a loved one with BPD gain control over his or her behavior is to set and enforce healthy limits or boundaries. Setting limits can help your loved one better deal with the outside world, where schools, work, and the legal system, for example, all set and enforce strict limits on what is and what is not acceptable behavior. Establishing boundaries in your relationship can replace the chaos and instability of your current situation with an important sense of structure and provide you with more choices about how to react when confronted by negative behavior. When both parties honor the boundaries, you’ll be able to build a sense of trust and respect between you, key ingredients for any meaningful relationship.

&gt; Setting boundaries is not a magic fix for a relationship, though. In fact, things may initially get worse before they get better. The person with BPD fears rejection and is sensitive to any perceived slight. This means that if you’ve never set boundaries in your relationship before, your loved one is likely to react badly when you start. If you back down in the face of your loved one’s rage or abuse, you’ll only be reinforcing his or her negative behavior and the cycle will continue.

617,"I think that lashing out after being upset because they want to hurt you deeply in that moment could be a manipulation. This wouldn't necessarily be a premeditated decision to manipulate you but rather something that just happens in the trigger - emotion - lashing out reaction cycle.

Any conversation had when calm could most definitely be a manipulation either intentional or unintentional. It's almost reflexive to use passive aggressive comments in order to get what they want but those comments may also reflect some genuine, deep seeded fears.

""1) Their emotions are more intense. Brain studies show that the ""emotional"" centers of the brain actually overpower the ""logical"" centers. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being high, once the emotions of an individual with BPD are at a six and over you can't really reason with them. They may kick or hit walls, slam doors, punch a car, break household items, and even become physically violent.

2) Their emotions are unpredictable, flipping quickly from one to another. You feel lost and confused as to what just happened. A woman says:

""His mood can change in the blink of an eye. Usually, we could be joking about something, having a really great time and even bonding, and then something I said would trigger something in him and he would get upset, then pissy, then angry, then raging. Sometimes it would take a few days for this to build up. But once it started, I could always tell what was going on. It's like feeling a storm front move in.You can feel the change in the atmosphere.""

3) One triggered, they take much longer to come down to baseline (a 1-3 on the scale). At the same time, once the emotion is gone, it's gone, and they don't remember feeling differently. They may not understand why you're still mad at them.

4) Because of their lack of impulse control, they act on their emotions before they've had a chance to think through the consequences of their actions. While their actions are intended to help them feel better, in the long run they feel worse. So emotional dysregulation leads to behavioral dysregulation.

5) They can hold a grudge forever about something that happened years ago and continually bring up what hurt them as if it happened yesterday.""",2015-09-16 16:40:33+00:00,cv3n4ib,1,t3_3l69h9,8872,BPDlovedones

Is that messed up of me? Cause even I personally think it is a little harsh, but possibly an eye opener at the same time.

It may be a little harsh but we all have needs. You need him to take care of himself and stick around. That's reasonable. I'm sorry if I came on a bit strong about the codependency thing. I just came from reading about some serious codependency problems in another subreddit.

Some people are better at certain things than others. There is something to be said about compromise and taking care of one another. Sometimes one partner enjoys taking over certain responsibilities because they prefer to do one thing over another (e.g. I cook, he cleans). Relationships are all about figuring out what works and communicating your feelings so things can be adjusted to work better.

I would suggest that you bring up your needs with him. Maybe when you introduce the idea of some of these strategies you could say something like, ""I worry about your health. I know that your heart valve adds responsibilities and it can be a pain to manage it. I need you to take care of yourself so you'll be around.

629,"Your story was fairly short. I'm not a medical professional. I have never met you or your mother. With that said, she seems a lot like my mother. My therapist told me that my mom probably has borderline personality disorder or at least BPD tendencies. It's a pretty tough disorder to treat but it has better results than narcissistic personality disorder. If she could ever be interested in therapy (my mom will not) then dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is the best option. BPD is summed up with ""I hate you, don't leave me.""

I've found that there is absolutely nothing that I can do that would please her. She will always ask for more and tries to break any healthy boundaries I set. She loves me and wants me to be happy (in an abstract way) but she wants to control every aspect of my life. I have found the following things have helped me keep a more healthy relationship with her: moving out, moving away, being independent from her financially, setting boundaries, having low contact, and visiting for short periods (2-3 days max). 

I would say that BPD is tough because she isn't just self-centered (like NPD to use you as a positive reflection of themselves or their outlet for negativity). They genuinely believe that you are the most wonderful person in the world and so incredibly proud at one point and can switch to seeing you as the most hateful and ungrateful child the next. The world is in black and white. Their emotions are intense and mood volatile. It creates a dynamic that makes you feel as if you owe them because it wasn't all bad.

643,"I think this is an interesting question. I would point you in the direction of transportation safety literature but I'm feeling lazy and would rather share my personal experience. Driving and practice is the only thing that will make you a better driver!

1. Become a behavior analyst

I tend to be a people watcher on the road. I don't mean that I look in to see who is driving but I tend to keep an eye on other cars looking for patterns or deviations from steady speed and staying within the lane. *Are they leaning to one side? Do they often change speeds? Do they break hard? Are they trying to whip through traffic?* I try not to drive next to any car for an extended period in case they don't see me when they want to change lanes (especially true for highway speeds and semi trucks). I try to decide whether I want to let them pass because I will only hold them up and cause them to drive more aggressively to get past me (regardless of my speed) or if I want to pass them. I look out for any vehicle with things attached (bikes, furniture strapped down, storage on top) and avoid staying behind them. I've seen things fly off cars too many times.

2. Know your car

If you have trouble maintaining speed when you zone out then try to make yourself more aware of your car. Try to notice the sound and vibration of different RPMs. I tend to maintain speed not by checking my speedometer but by ""feeling"" how hard my car is working to speed up or maintain a particular speed. You'll actually be more fuel efficient if you focus more to your RPMs and maintain a fairly constant speed than by setting cruise control. Cruise control tends to work hard to keep your car at a specific speed.

3. Be aggressive enough to be assertive

I know we shouldn't be aggressive but in high traffic, low speed environments you sometimes need to let people know that they can't push you around and constantly cut in or else you'll be sitting there all day. 

4. Put your cell phone away

This is obvious. I don't always do it. I use my phone too often at lights and as a GPS. You just shouldn't. It's a distraction.

5. Fudge the speed limit

Again, I could argue to never ever exceed the speed limit like you should never ever be an aggressive driver but there are exceptions. Sometimes everyone is going over the speed limit. The key in those situations is to increase following distance and try to stay around the same speed as the other motorists and move to the right if you're slower than other drivers (regardless of the speed limit). If you're going the speed limit or 5mph below in a left or middle lane then someone may come up behind you quickly. Use track etiquette and move to the right if you're slower and stay to the left if you're fast. The jerks that weave through lanes to get a little ahead and put everyone else at risk will get into an accident eventually. 

6. Be predictable

Use signals, double check before you change lanes, change lanes somewhat gradually in case you didn't see someone, have a safe following distance so you don't break hard, stick around the same speed, etc.

Tips for driving

- follow the 3 second rule for following distance in normal weather and increase when weather or visibility is poor (if you need to stop very suddenly and think you may not have enough distance to avoid something in front of you then try to steer clear by going off on the shoulder)

- maintain your car so your brakes work, wipers work, have enough windshield fluid, etc.",2015-09-14 14:15:11+00:00,cv15340,1,t3_3kw8qc,11881,ADHD

I have found that my anxiety was almost completely the result of my untreated ADHD. Anxiety allowed me to worry enough to remember things. The anxiety that built after procrastinating until the last minute provided stimulation needed to get my work done. Anxiety was essentially acting as a really terrible stimulant.

&gt;medications for ADHD also help with OCD

Based on the link below, it seems like medications for ADHD may exacerbate OCD symptoms. They recommend treating OCD before introducing a stimulant. 

http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/6113-3.html

""It is not uncommon for someone to have both ADHD and OCD. Since the presenting behaviors might look the same, it is important to know whether both problems exist.""

""For reasons that are not known, stimulant medications may exacerbate an existing case of OCD. Or, if the OCD behaviors are minimal and not obvious to parents, a stimulant may make them clinically apparent. The first clue that someone has ADHD and OCD -- or may have OCD rather than ADHD -- is a significant increase in OCD behaviors after taking a stimulant medication.""

""If you or your child has both conditions, it is best to treat the OCD first. Once these behaviors are under control, the stimulant can often be reintroduced without causing a flare-up of the OCD behaviors. If you think that your son or daughter may have ADHD and OCD, see a professional who understands the concept of treating someone with more than one disorder.""",2015-09-13 22:09:26+00:00,cv0hru6,5,t1_cv0gg98,2163,ADHD

She doesn't recognize her role in destroying relationships and only sees herself as a victim. All I can do is grit my teeth when she goes on about all the people who have wronged her or how she's a good mother. It is really tough to have a relationship with someone so completely unaware of themselves. I know that she had a difficult childhood (or at least she saw it that way) and that she is dealing with a disorder. I try to step outside my hurt and acknowledge that she is a broken person but sometimes I wish she would disappear.

&gt; I just don't know if I can do it again. 

Sometimes you need a break. You're emotionally spent. Put yourself first.

&gt; I have tried to forgive her for the way she's treated my sisters and I but it's hard when she's not sorry. 

I don't think my mom even knows that she did something wrong so she isn't capable of being sorry (see previous statement about being a ""good mom""). This might sound stupid but I think that forgiveness is more about letting go of some of your pain. You're not forgiving her to absolve her or say that it was okay. You've decided that you're forgiving her to move on. With that said, can you really forgive when she still hurts you? It is a new offense every time I feel that she minimizes my childhood experiences.

&gt; She'll barely admit that the things that happened really happened. She has skewed memories of the way she's been as a mother

I really have difficulty understanding this. Does she not remember because it helps protect her self-image and her way of coping with being so terrible? Does she see herself as a victim so everything was okay? Does she change the story after the fact because she doesn't like the way it makes her look or feel? Her skewed memory feels like gas lighting. I don't think we'll ever understand how she can't remember what we want to forget.

&gt; How do I just call it quits? I am so tired.

I have found that low contact has helped me negotiate the emotional burnout of having a relationship with her and the guilt about cutting off someone that has very few people in her life. I don't live close to her so she can't just stop by and trips to visit are kept short. I've never gone NC with her so I can't provide advice there.  

&gt; For the last 3 months I haven't had to deal with it and it has been kind of a relief

I think this speaks for itself. Your relationship is so draining. It seems like it would be better for you and your family if you continue to keep her out of your life. Life is too short to waste.

This is essentially my fear. I'm a grad student, diagnosed a few months ago, just started medication. I planned on having children after grad school. Now that I know I have ADHD and seem to need medication, I'm concerned about working while pregnant and off medication.

I really don't want to lose what I am just starting to gain (after years of struggling but not knowing why). I'm worried that if I go off medications while pregnant that I may mess up my career.

Top comment/correct description of how vyvanse works:

&gt;Vyvanse is not a precursor as dextroamphetamine is not a naturally occurring substance in the body. Vyvanse is inactivated dextroamphetamine with an attached lysine molecule that must be cleaved off by proteases in the small intestine and in the blood in order to be activated.
When you take vyvanse..proteases from your pancreas are secreted into the small intestine to cleave the lysine molecule and activate the compound. Hence..if you eat a high protein breakfast...more protease is secreted in response to protein in the digestive tract.
Vyvanse is ""long-acting"" because it is continually broken down in the bloodstream. However..for some people...it only lasts 4-6 hours. The 'average"" time for vyvanse is 12 hours..but every body is different.",2015-09-12 18:32:32+00:00,cuz7d6n,2,t1_cuz783f,239,ADHD

687,"I think this is a good question. I think it has been posted before but probably regarding a different medication. I don't have an answer but I can share my experience with trying to figure out the ""right dose"" so far.

I started on vyvanse 20mg for 1 week to get used to it then went to 40mg for 2 weeks. I met with my doctor as a check in. I think I'm seeing it positively affect my work for tasks that are fairly simple but I'm still having trouble with the challenging work tasks for which I decided I need medication. 

He discussed expectations and clarified that the medicine doesn't do the work essentially (discipline and routine that /u/roeig mentions). I explained that the work I continue to struggle with requires a lot more working memory and sustained focus than the simple tasks where I saw a marked improvement.

We decided to bump up the dose to 50mg and see how it goes. I would prefer to be on the lowest effective dose but I would like to see if the change in dose helps. I have had very few problems with side effects so fair and even had improvements in other areas of my life that I didn't realize ADHD influenced at all or quite so much (anxiety, energy, bored eating, unhealthy choices, relationships).",2015-09-12 17:30:23+00:00,cuz57ag,1,t3_3knlno,20170,ADHD

691,"&gt; counterintuitive way trying hard to make his mom happy only hurts him and enables her to stay sick.

This is really difficult to learn. 

&gt;ONLY give her what energy you can spare

You are very right about the indebtedness and even more so for the perspective of a child. She has done wonderful things for me. She supported our family financially and sent me to college. She really does want me to be happy and gives in ways that she can. I used to give her a lot of my time and energy. I slowly pulled back and began to put myself first (difficult to do when you're ""parentified""). It struck me (at 25...) that she did not recognize the sacrifices I had made for her and that it didn't matter how much I gave. She would never think it was enough. So, I decided then to do what I needed to do for myself. It makes me feel good when I can be there for her (in healthy, appropriate ways). She still has inappropriate demands and expectations at times but I let her know that those things are not going to happen. 

&gt; I'm finding I need to personally move in the opposite direction. I focus on my wife's perspective too much and sympathize too much.

I completely understand. You love her and care about her. You are with her every day. You are wrapped up in it. I could not sympathize with my mom often when I lived with her and was a lightning rod for her emotions.

&gt;but with healthy compartmentalization we can compassionately open or close areas of ourselves as needed to maintain structural integrity.

That's a good way to think about it but damn we not built like spaceships at all. You're explaining very well. I think forums like this are wonderful because I have never met someone with a BPD loved one. We can understand without needing to explain fully because you just can't explain it. It can be so inconsistent throughout the day or week yet consistent over time so family and friends don't really understand either.

&gt; I think to help her I need to get to a point I don't care 'why' she did X behavior and I act based solely on the behavior she chooses.

Cause and effect. It's good to simplify and take sympathy out of it so you can make good decisions. We make decisions about how to behave based on reason and emotion. It can be very difficult to take the emotional aspect out of our decision making processes.

I've really enjoyed talking with you as well. We're in very different places in all of this but we can appreciate our shared and unique perspectives. I wish we could grab a beer and vent sometime. Maybe joke about putting your wife and my mom in a cage match? Who would passive-aggressively kill the other one first? Take care and be blessed fellow friend.

692,"&gt; I was diagnosed when I was quite young, around age 6

I think it's really tough to get a diagnosis when you are young and still trying to form your sense of self. ADHD really affects self-esteem and self-worth.

&gt; Taking meds made me feel like I was accepting that I couldn't do what other people could, i.e. my brain was inferior in a way that I couldn't fix or control.

I understand. I think a lot of it is about perspective. In my perspective, I see medication as a helping hand when you're struggling. 

&gt; I feel like a failure, a disappointment to myself

You did the best you could. You are different and you just need a little help to reach your potential. Rather than seeing using medication as a failure, see it as self-care. 

&gt;Should I start taking meds now that I have started senior year?

It's never too late. I was just diagnosed in grad school after struggling with the added workload for years. You may decide that it helps with work (once you graduate) and even other areas of your life as well. I've found it helped with my eating junk food for stimulation, given me more energy to do things that I want to do, and even improved my relationship by giving me a longer fuse. 

It's surprising how many areas of our lives are affected by ADHD.

You're very right. I grew up too fast.

&gt;so many of us would rather despise or see as the enemy

We're all broken people trying to do our best to navigate this world. I didn't know that my mom had a personality disorder until very recently. It doesn't change anything but I understand that she is a victim of her own thinking and behavior as well.

&gt; I realize this post doesn't add anything.

I really appreciate your reply. Sometimes it feels good to know you're not alone. I wonder about my father and the way he felt. He enabled and avoided her but I don't know how he felt through all of it (they're divorced).

&gt; every step forward I make or survive, just having an SO with these behaviors and traits, it nearly destroys me

I'm sorry. It's really hard to live with someone that makes you feel like you're walking on egg shells and just trying to get by. I know the environment feels worse than it probably sounds if you were to describe it to someone. I know that moving out and away from home has immeasurably improved my life. I know she is lonely but it's very stressful to live in a place of vigilance.

&gt; I think of my own innocent son, like you, caught up in this thing I can barely handle.

I know that my mom had a very difficult childhood. Her mother had undiagnosed mental health problems that may have been BPD. Her father was an enabler and denied that there was any problem even when she told my mother (on many occasions that she wanted to kill herself). Challenges at home are much more difficult for children to deal with because they haven't learned how to manage these feelings yet. I recommend counseling or therapy for your son and yourself as well. 

&gt; I don't understand how you can have the fight and love left in you that you do.

I guess it is less about the fight and more about the empathy and desire to have the healthiest relationship possible with my mom. I know that being independent helps me be more empathetic because I'm not constantly stressed.

&gt; I struggle to understand how you are so capable of holding so many viewpoints with so much regard at the same time.

I think it is very tough to put yourself in someone else's shoes. I've experienced the family fighting and her genuine hurt she feels. It's something that I still worry about around the holidays (too much pressure for everyone it seems).

&gt; if I can't fix my wife, please tell me how she is my son's responsibility? 

I think that's the problem. You can't fix her. He can't fix her. Therapy and a lot of work may help her improve herself but she needs to want it or at least be open to doing the work. It's almost like you need to be able to love the good, create boundaries to limit the bad (or at least the effect of it on you and your son), and take things as they come.

&gt; I can NOT save her, I can't even seem to help her as most of my help just enables her to go farther down the hole.

I see a lot of similarities in BPD and alcoholism in that they tell families to let them hit bottom, don't cover up or hide their mistakes, don't keep them from failing, etc. You can only control your actions. She is responsible for herself and her own happiness. Unfortunately, there is nothing that will make her happy - even if you could do everything she asks perfectly - in part because joy and happiness is a fleeting feeling for someone with BPD. I can't imagine what that must be like. 

Thank you for sharing your feelings. I really appreciate it. I wish I had a magical solution for us all. I think therapy or counseling is one of the best things I have ever decided to do for myself. ",2015-09-12 14:18:09+00:00,cuyzahj,3,t1_cuynuvu,39644,BPDlovedones

Second, I noticed that our mothers are similar so I found this post from your reply to another comment.

I cannot conceive of how many hours of my life I have spent listening and validating and calmly coaching her through her endless rages and traumas, being the emotional dumping ground for every imaginary argument she's had when the person wasn't actually available. The idea of continuing to do so as she rages against doctors, and my father, and cancer, and life makes me go absolutely numb. I don't know what to do.

We are about the same age - us and our moms. I feel fortunate that she has not had any major medical problems but I see that being an issue very soon. She's an alcoholic that doesn't take care of herself. I have thought a lot about how I would handle her care. I feel that the best way to approach it is the same way I try to approach my relationship currently - take out the emotion, provide functional support, and let her make her own decisions.

I know that it is impossible to take emotions out of the equation but it could help protect you. You can make sure she gets to doctors appointments, has her medicine, whatever but treat it more like a series of tasks and try to stay emotionally de-vested from her decisions (obviously this changes if or when she needs you to make decisions for her).

- treating people badly

- having them react to mistreatment in a way that she perceives as being cruel, unfair, injustice

- trying to ""right"" the injustice by lashing out and making things more difficult

- coming to me to vent and complain about the way she was victimized

- I listen to her, try to stay relatively neutral but agree if it seems that she was mistreated, try to help her see another perspective and not take things so personally

It's tough because I think that everyone should be able to talk to someone about their problems but she doesn't have many people in her life.

724,"&gt;Every little thing anyone does that could be perceived as a slight, definitely is and the person did it with malice. No matter how small. She's managed to cause drama with pretty much every member of my family, it makes family get togethers stressful as fuck as I'm on alert making sure to talk her down or postpone her behavior until we've left.

This is my mom. She doesn't think she has a problem. Always a victim. She's also an alcoholic. She thinks therapy is for weak people. I don't have a lot of confidence that she will ever change but I do my best to set boundaries. 

I'm really happy that your wife is open to therapy. I hope DPT works well. Please keep us updated. I don't know how your family will handle the information but it may help if you try to adjust some of their expectations without actually disclosing a diagnosis. You don't want to betray her trust but having family that is a bit more forgiving and understanding may make things easier.

I'm sure that the psychiatrist will figure out BPD fairly quickly. I'm not sure if you're planning to go with her and mention some of the things you're dealing with as a couple. I know that BPD means that they see things their way and she may be unaware of some of the challenges or see it as something that you start.",2015-09-11 14:05:39+00:00,cuxwo7c,1,t3_3kinp9,21101,BPDlovedones

I have difficulty making an argument against something as a graduate student because I don't want to offend or have someone think that I feel my opinion is superior to another researcher.

728,"&gt;I was embarrassed even though she's technically a therapist and she is used to it. I just didn't want her to see how deeply she impacted me- but maybe that turned out to be a good thing, since it gave her some awareness of herself.

That's a great way to look at it!

I'm glad that you're seeing a therapist that is great for you! ADHD coaching is sort of like applied (ADHD specific) cognitive behavioral therapy where they work with you to trouble shoot your challenges and help create and modify solutions that will work for you. 

Communication is so key to the doctor-patient relationship and it's important that they take your feelings and wishes into account when deciding your care. I just met with my doc for the first time since starting medication and there was a bit of a dance around the effect of the meds - it helped in areas of work that I struggled with less (staying on task and focusing) but didn't help much with a couple of problem areas. He sort of tried to adjust my expectations. I further explained that the work I was struggling with requires a lot of working memory and is challenging so it's easier to procrastinate. He decided to bump up my dose a little bit and we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping it helps but also completely okay with going back down in dose if I don't notice a benefit.

- have an initial question of how's it going to warm up and let others arrive late if an issue,

- assign individuals to provide updates about their specific topics, 

- set aside time to confirm goals/to-dos for the next meeting and set a date/time for the next meeting,

- everyone says what they liked about the meeting

- send the agenda prior to the next meeting but not too far in advance

- your job may be to assign tasks, keep the meeting on schedule, organize notes, maybe assign someone else to take notes so you can focus on leading the discussion

**Informational meeting**

- come prepared with questions and your own goals about what you would like to learn or gain from the meeting/training

- come prepared with ways to record notes/questions

- potentially record audio from the meeting

**Updates meeting**

- give a general overview of the updated status

- have your updates ready as bullet points of things done/accomplished, any challenges or problems resolved, etc.

- take the opportunity to ask for additional resources/support if needed, explain if you expect future needs so things can be adjusted

841,"I think that this is actually a halfway decent letter with some good advice. Namely, the following statements:

&gt;It is infinitely more complicated to end a relationship when you still have joint financial responsibilities. Your landlord will not care at all whether you and Max continue to be together or not. The rent will be due. And, worst case, you then end up spending money for more than one place. That is not a situation you can afford.
&gt;You have only known Max a short time. Your feelings for him may be strong, but, with your priorities being school, you still need a place to go to that is your own, and that can provide a suitable study environment. So that if you need to study, you can do that without guilt from the other person in the room, however unintentional that guilt may be. If your relationship does not, for whatever reason, last as long as you think it will, you will have a place of your own to return to.

I think those reasons are actually very good reasons to hold off on moving in together. If they are funding all or the majority of your schooling and housing then I would choose to comply with their request because of the associated debt and wait to move in together after you finish school.

If you are financing most of your own schooling and housing then do what you want to do with or without their blessing and financial support. It is up to you. I completely understand how it feels to have someone use financial support as leverage to control you. If you want to remove that leverage then you are free from their control but it will make managing finances more difficult. You can live your life as you wish but they have no obligation to help finance something that they do not support.",2015-09-05 17:26:18+00:00,curnobf,1,t3_3jr0lq,8563,raisedbynarcissists

I would take the same approach that most teenagers do - emulate your friends by trying what they like and seeing what you think. You may find that you really do like what they like. Give yourself time to experiment and feel things out before completely diving in. Don't simply become a clone of one friend. Sample what you find interesting or fashion that you admire.

853,"Great advice and comments that I agree with completely. I've learned these things over time. 

The girl only trips are with women she has never met before so I think they might work out because she is always better behaved with other people. It seems like any friendship fizzles because she gives but has high expectations and cuts them off if they don't live up to those expectations. She's a generous and caring person but too mercurial to make things work.

I maintain my relationship with her now because of pity more than anything else. Everyone needs someone to talk to about their day and their challenges. I don't soften blows but I sometimes try to explain the other side of an argument when she feels wronged. She has a very difficult time imagining someone else's perspective. Sometimes that makes her change her tone or de-escalate but sometimes not. I don't begin to try to control her, even if there will be negative consequences. I have established boundaries and rules for myself so I won't lose too much time or energy over her. I recognize that she has her faults and struggles with some issues but generally means well. I'll adjust our level of contact and boundaries as needed but for now it's fine (no kids now). The real difficulty is when she says she is a great mom. It's tough to grit my teeth through that and change the subject. She's definitely looking for me to agree and I can't.

What makes all of this so sad is that she had a tough time growing up. I don't know how it compares to my experience but I know it was difficult for her. She's a victim too but, of course, that doesn't justify treating anyone poorly. ",2015-09-03 16:57:57+00:00,cupfc9x,4,t1_cupe8yp,1668,raisedbynarcissists

&gt; expect to get hurt. So much so that it's almost like they're actively looking for things that can be explained in such a way that they are hurtful.

Yes, incredibly sensitive. She has a history of taking offense, blowing up, telling someone to go away, they go, then she has a breakdown and thinks they left her. It's kind of amazing how different she sees things.

As for therapy, she believes it is fine for weak people and she does not need therapy. As for her alcoholism, she refuses to acknowledge it is an issue. She may be BPD but I don't know that she will ever be ready to make a change. Who knows though. I hope one day she will be.

I kind of hoped she would meet someone and travel with them instead. Unfortunately, her romantic relationships barely get past the first date before she decides they are not good enough.

I think she may do a women's only trip with a travel group that puts together trips for 10-20 people. She may love it and end up doing more of that but I think she will always want to have a family vacation each year.

&gt;You don't sound ungrateful by the way. My mother (though most likely NPD) also did a lot for me in terms of money. And even with other issues I suspect some part of her thought she was actually helping, wanted to actually help but couldn't. But part of her also actively hurted her children.

The good does not wash away the bad. I've dealt with a lot of emotional and verbal abuse over the years. It is nice to have financial support at times but I would've rather had a more stable household. We don't get to choose our family, unfortunately.

Part of why the hunter v. farmer hypothesis struck me was the explanation that it was developed in response to his son not taking the diagnosis well.  My sibling was diagnosed at a young age, our parents were inconsistent with behavioral supports for academic success at best and emotionally or verbally abuse at worst, he had pills pushed on him and side-effects unreported to his doctor.  All of these things messed with his development of his self-identity and self-esteem.

He completely rejects that ADHD is real or that he has it or that I can have it.  I think it's a really fucking hard thing to deal with and even more so as a child.  I guess I wanted the conversation to go more in the direction about accepting ourselves (based on a comment thread with another user today) and the diagnosis.  Anyway.... here I am rambling.

No need to worry about me not wanting to post or comment.  I generally overthink things before I say them (let alone type them).  I generally seek out those that are looking for emotional support or basic guidance because it meant so much to me when I was diagnosed a few months ago.  I want to contribute to the community.

It's a big book and not ADHD specific but an interesting read about how our world has changed so much that we need different strategies to handle information overload. It fits with the ADHD as a benefit to hunter-gatherers idea.

I've not been good about using it. As a woman, my pockets are small and flashcards are big so I put it in my purse then forgot...

895,"Yes, this is a thing. It's connected to planning deficits and time blindness (Dr. Russell Barkley). 

My ADHD coach recommended the flashcard strategy. Write your to do list on flash cards (one item/activity per card).  Every morning (or the night before) select 3-5 cards (or however many work for you) to complete that day. Keep them in your pocket, check them every once in a while throughout the day and rearrange based on priority or your shifting schedule. Once you have done a task, move the card to the other pocket (tearing them in half is satisfying). Keep working on your pile until you're done. Throw your cards in the recycling bin at the end of the day. If you don't finish cards then they move to the pile for the next day.

This works because, instead of seeing an endless list and being overwhelmed, you have one priority at any given time and you can shift the priority as needed.",2015-09-01 15:05:54+00:00,cun1p3g,1,t3_3j82yf,1479,ADHD

905,"There is such a thing as work-life balance. Being too far on the life side with ADHD then too far on the work side while medicated doesn't really give you a good sense of what is healthy or balanced. You need to recognize that you are not a machine that can do work all the time. Research says that down time and disengaging from work makes us more productive (just don't disengage all the time ;) I think we both relate to that). We've been ""time-blind"" as Russell Barkley describes it - unable to clearly recognize our past failings and successes and unable to plan for the future based on those experiences. I tend to be overly optimistic about what I can accomplish and it seems like you do too. Here are some useful reminders about good goal setting (applicable to short term (daily or hourly goals) and long term (weeks, months, or even years).

SMART Goal Setting:

- Specific – target a specific area for improvement.

- Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.

- Assignable – specify who will do it.

- Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.

- Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.

EDIT: ""Also feeling guilty that if it's just me working under a placebo, all this time it was really just me being lazy and incompetent and I could have done better sooner.""

You're still coming to terms with your diagnosis and that's okay. There's a book ""You mean I'm not lazy, stupid, or crazy?"" that you might want to read. ADHD is a tough thing to come to terms with. If you could've done better sooner, you would have done so without needing to see a doctor, get a diagnosis, and start medication. Seriously, if it were that easy for us then we would've done it. Don't beat yourself up about it. You're doing the best you can now and you were doing the best you could then. The difference is you're taking medication. I HIGHLY recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to work out some of these feelings.",2015-09-01 09:25:27+00:00,cumurcq,3,t1_cumuiqn,1056,ADHD
906,"""She said she was proud of how much I was working, but also to really have a good think about whether it's the medicine or just me (and the fact I'm sleeping more regularly these days -- which I did because I wanted to medication to work efficiently), because she doesn't want to use our family's health insurance just so I can have a placebo.""

I'm sure your mom is a nice lady but she can kindly fuck off. What an undermining thing to say to someone who is working on figuring things out. 

You need to establish good working habits and a routine that you can stick with. The medications make this process easier. I have found that there is only so much I can do without meds then I hit a wall. The meds don't do the work for you but they bring the wall from 9 feet high to 3 feet high so you can get over your obstacles more easily.

I want to say that in some ways the anxiety about failure is good if it motivates you to keep working on improving things but if it is too much anxiety then it can be debilitating. Keep your responsibilities and work load to a reasonable level so you are setting yourself up to succeed. 

As an example, I started vyvanse last week at 20mg. I had more energy and no fatigue but I didn't really have any other benefits. I took 40 mg yesterday and it helped my symptoms a lot. Except, I felt like I had three major projects that were all equally important (for different reasons) with imminent deadlines (all due today!) because I had fallen behind the previous week. Some level of absurd optimism (or insanity) convinced me that I could do 4-5 days worth of work in 1 day if I organized my time well. Obviously, that did not work out. I got one major project done. I'm happy about that and I'm trying to make good progress on another. There's a lot more work to do and I want to make up for lost time while I can. You (and I) need to remember to also be reasonable to ourselves.

913,"/r/campingandhiking is more of the backpacking crew. /r/camping is more casual/car camping. Remember to try to pack light. The weight of your pack and gear may seem fine for 15 minutes at home but add up fast if you're hiking with it two days straight. /r/campinggear may also be able to make some good recommendations for you. Unless your friend has a sleeping pad for you to borrow, then you will want to pick one of those up too because the ground will be cold, uneven, and hard to sleep on (even in a tent). I recommend trying out a couple of different types of pads at your local retailer to get an idea of what you feel is comfortable in a sleeping pad before you buy.

If you DO want to get into backpacking then now is a good time to get a couple basics at specialty stores like REI, Eastern Mountain Sports, Backcountry, etc. because they are all having sales. **Woot.com** and **Steepandcheap.com** are discount retailers that might have what you need.

If you DON'T want to commit to backpacking then I suggest trying to rent gear from REI or buying cheap.



**MOST IMPORTANT** - get a sleeping bag rated for 15 degrees below the COLDEST it will be on your trip. The ratings are more for survival than comfort. It is always safer to get a sleeping bag rated for colder than you need.

Essentially, my anxiety was keeping me on track and developed as a result of ADHD. I was a polite, respectful, conscientious, and generally very good student (As &amp; Bs). I graduated cum laude in college with two degrees in 4 years. Things became really tough in graduate school when I had to manage my thesis work independently. I'm behind and I couldn't get my act together with my own research but was okay when working on group things with hard deadlines. I'm smart and could generally get away with doing everything the night before but that wasn't possible with long term projects in graduate school.

I'm working on improving my work environment to support good work and focus, trying to improve my diet and exercise more, maintain better sleep habits, etc. I just started medication (day 5!) but so far it hasn't helped with focusing on work but I think I need to work harder to apply myself. It has given me much more energy. I am usually very lethargic so this is great. 

For me, diagnosis was a relief. I came to better understand myself and my actions. I know that I struggle with some things in ways that many others don't but I recognize everyone has their challenges. It's not part of my identity but it explains why I do some silly things. I desperately wish I had been diagnosed earlier so I wouldn't be in the difficult position I am in now. I'm not happy with myself currently but I'm working to better myself every day. I'm determined to graduate with my doctorate because I know I am capable.

Meds work as long as you're taking them but they may help you create strategies that work if you're off meds.

I don't disclose to people so I don't have to deal with their non-expert opinion. I've only told those very close to me who would understand and accept it. At the end of the day, who cares what anyone thinks if you're doing something that is right for you?

Haven't dealt with substance abuse personally but it is common among those with ADHD. If they put you on a stimulant, I hope they give you vyvanse as it needs to be digested by your liver to enter your blood stream so it is less likely to be abused.

Given your past (and current?) drug use, I think that getting that under control should be your first priority. Focusing on your health and well-being is the most important thing. Try to shift your activities from ones that remind you of or encourage the use of drugs. Try to do something different, try to meet other people. I know it's hard to get away from drugs when it has been such a large part of your life and friendships.

Consider putting potentially damaging materials such as scissors, pens, markers, crayons, paint, etc. in a place that he cannot reach and only allow supervised access.

Key portion regarding open workspaces and the benefits of having quiet options

""The problem with open office spaces

As companies have squeezed more workers into smaller spaces and broken down walls in the name of collaboration, they’ve started to feel a pushback. While many cheered the demise of the cubicle, employers and employees alike are discovering the toll that crowded open-office plans can take on productivity and well-being.

The primary issue with open office plans is that there are so many visual and audio distractions that can interrupt worker focus. In a study of 90,000 people from 155 companies, Gensler found that individual focus was the most important factor in an employee’s effectiveness in the workplace. The company also found that focus was the activity least effectively supported by current office design.

Even when an office is open and airy, some employees may still find it to be oppressive. Studies have found open office plans impair memory and increase stress, especially for introverts. Open offices are also known to spread disease more quickly, causing workers to take more sick days. “We’ve shifted over time to designing for collaboration at the expense of having places for people to focus,” says McLaurin.

If you work in an open office, you might be familiar with the variety of coping strategies that workers come up with – from noise canceling headphones and earplugs, to constructing elaborate visual barriers out of book shelves and plants.

Now more offices are trying to help provide spaces where workers can focus without interruption. As The Post’s Jena McGregor writes, one solution is creating more private areas, including workspaces that are surrounded by a privacy wall.

960,"You mention that he gets sidetracked by other colleagues. I know I have a great deal of trouble blocking out audio, visual, and other disturbances when trying to work. Do you have a work environment in which someone can work in quiet? I know a lot of small start ups use a very small, open space which is wonderful for collaborations and meetings and terrible if you're trying to focus on doing work on your own. 

My solution is to use headphones and isolate myself to an area where I can look at a wall rather than catch glimpses of people walking by or listening to other conversations. You may want to provide these small, individual focused workspaces as it improves productivity among all employees. It's great when you're small. You can establish your work culture and it can change more easily than a large organization. Flexible work time and work place is very helpful not only to those with ADHD but also to improve work-life balance and employee satisfaction.

Likewise, smaller goals on projects with shorter deadlines is very helpful (even for those that don't have ADHD). Think about what feedback - good and bad - that you're giving your employees and how often.

982,"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/prime-your-gray-cells/201110/why-sugar-high-leads-brain-low

""If you're a ""sugar junkie"" - you should know that the effects that build up from excess sugar can lead to permanent health conditions such as diabetes. A once-in-awhile indulgence into sugar can make for a bad day, but it's less likely to cause a permanent condition.

To answer your question more specifically, as the article discusses, when you cause an elevated blood-sugar level due to eating lots of sugars, you also elevate your insulin level. This sharp rise in insulin, through a complex series of chemical events, triggers a rise in stress hormones such as cortisol. Cortisol, among its many actions, is a powerful insulin-suppressor. It inhibits insulin production in an attempt to prevent glucose from being stored (thus keeping it in the blood), favoring its immediate use.

Consistently high blood glucose levels (which trigger insulin, which then triggers cortisol) lead to cells that are ""starved"" for glucose (since it's being kept in the blood rather than being shuttled to cells). This can lead to overeating, and eating poor-quality foods, which only serves to start the blood sugar --&gt; insulin --&gt; cortisol train all over again.

Another suspect is chronic inflammation - an immune response to a poor diet (among other things). This sort of inflammation isn't the inflammation you get from an injury or a cut (where the injury turns red, swollen, and warm), but ""systemic"" low-level inflammation - and it's been well-documented that a sugar-high diet causing insulin spikes can be a source of this type of low-level, constant inflammation. Constant inflammation from such sources can trigger even *more* soaring cortisol (as your stress system will respond to the immune system's inflammatory signal), which as we've seen, is what can really cause long-term detrimental effects. Inflammation and cortisol can work together to break down the mitochondria in cells, which are their main producers of energy.

In nerve cells, if mitochondria break down too much, the nerve cell will eventually die. In the brain, this can lead to all sorts of problems, from fatigue to memory loss and everything in between. So, in effect, a nutritionally poor and sugar-high diet can eventually lead to permanent conditions, not the least of which is problems with the brain (among other serious conditions, such as diabetes).""",2015-08-27 21:01:05+00:00,cuhwqxt,3,t1_cuhwafc,679,ADHD

You may have symptoms that you didn't even notice (ADHD or otherwise).",2015-08-27 14:42:47+00:00,cuhhemw,1,t3_3il8xp,8842,ADHD

996,"Yes, I think that your experience is similar to many others with ADHD. I think the quick reaction to someone debating whether or not they have ADHD is to tell them to see a doctor (preferably a psychiatrist, ADHD specialist, or clinical psychologist - see side bar). I'm sure you just feel a bit alone and unsure. You have plenty of other people with ADHD (if that is what you have) here. Medication is often helpful when behavioral management, diet, exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress reduction are not enough. I understand why you feel anxious. I did as well. It's not so bad. You'll probably either feel relieved to receive a diagnosis (ADHD or otherwise). You can also try a second doctor for another opinion. ",2015-08-26 20:16:55+00:00,cugnv63,2,t1_cugk86o,5259,ADHD

I'm talking as if you're in the US which may be incorrect. I mention this also because cognitive behavioral therapy and/or ADHD coaching will be useful and insurance will help cover the costs.

You would need to call the doctor's office to ask what it would cost without insurance. It will vary. You should see a psychiatrist or APRN regarding your diagnosis and treatment because they can prescribe medication. They will take you seriously if you approach them about the issues you are dealing with currently but they will not if you approach them expecting an immediate diagnosis and prescription.

You can ask your pharmacist for the cost of certain prescriptions without insurance but you will likely need a prescription from your doctor before they would be willing to answer you. Your doctor may not recommend adderall for you for example.

Eat healthy - try to focus on easy/healthy opportunities that you can keep with your daily routine (e.g. replacing fries with salads, cut out soda, snack on veggies, etc.)

Sleep well - establish a regular time to go to bed and wake up - I know it's tough but you will sleep so much better

Social life - think of something you would like to get out and do once a week and try to do it with friends - hike, going to the gym, going tubing, whatever

1092,"- Keep a consistent sleep schedule. Get up at the same time every day, even on weekends or during vacations.

- Set a bedtime that is early enough for you to get at least seven hours of sleep.

- Don’t go to bed unless you are sleepy. 

- If you don’t fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed. 

- Establish relaxing bedtime rituals. 

- Use your bed only for sleep and sex. 

- Make your bedroom quiet and relaxing. Keep the room at a comfortable, cool temperature. 

- Limit exposure to light in the evenings. 

- Don’t eat a large meal before bedtime. If you are hungry at night, eat a light, healthy snack. 

- Exercise regularly and maintain a healthy diet. 

- Avoid consuming caffeine in the late afternoon or evening. 

- Avoid consuming alcohol before bedtime. 

- Reduce your fluid intake before bedtime.

1093,"Sleep hygiene is key

- Avoid napping during the day. It can disturb the normal pattern of sleep and wakefulness.

- Avoid stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol too close to bedtime. While alcohol is well known to speed the onset of sleep, it disrupts sleep in the second half as the body begins to metabolize the alcohol, causing arousal.

- Exercise can promote good sleep. Vigorous exercise should be taken in the morning or late afternoon. A relaxing exercise, like yoga, can be done before bed to help initiate a restful night's sleep.

- Food can be disruptive right before sleep.  Stay away from large meals close to bedtime. Also dietary changes can cause sleep problems, if someone is struggling with a sleep problem, it's not a good time to start experimenting with spicy dishes. And, remember, chocolate has caffeine.

- Ensure adequate exposure to natural light. This is particularly important for older people who may not venture outside as frequently as children and adults. Light exposure helps maintain a healthy sleep-wake cycle.

- Establish a regular relaxing bedtime routine. Try to avoid emotionally upsetting conversations and activities before trying to go to sleep. Don't dwell on, or bring your problems to bed.
Associate your bed with sleep. It's not a good idea to use your bed to watch TV, listen to the radio, or read.

1108,"TLDR: Satisficing (a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.) versus Maximizing (an approach that specifically attempts to find the best alternative available.) on decision making. 

Sometimes one is ideal and sometimes it is the other. Don't always do one or the other. Figure out what is really important and move on. Alternatively, wait to make a decision and the choice will be easier to make because the opportunity is gone (sale is over, tickets are sold out) or you'll realize it's not so important to you after all.

Example story:

I decide I want to buy something (e.g. rain boots). I see my friend has Hunter wellington boots. Now I want them. I find the price and get sticker shock. I look up reviews. Decide they're too cool and fashionable not to try to get them on sale or buy the cheaper kid versions. I spend time figuring out what size I would need because the sizing is off. I finally decide they're just too expensive, feel unsure about the right fit so I can't buy the clearance ones that are final sale, and decide that I won't be able to tuck my jeans in so they're out. Spend time looking for cool wellington boots for cheap. Must be cute, inexpensive, and durable. Totally achievable, right? Of course, I am trying to maximize my decision because I am frugal and a research monster but I'm wasting time on that instead of doing work. I should be satisficing and just getting something that is pretty good and a decent price rather than throwing hours away searching. I finally found a pair of perfect boots. I couldn't tuck my jeans in so they're going back. Square 1 again. ",2015-08-16 19:06:28+00:00,cu53c7y,1,t3_3h541l,74172,ADHD

1. Giving clear instructions and following through with appropriate consequences when needed

2. Recognizing and praising your student's good behaviors and positive characteristics to promote desired behaviors

1256,"I haven't learned enough to break the cycle. I learned enough to realize that anxiety wasn't causing the cycle but instead ADHD was the true culprit. Recently diagnosed, have an appointment to discuss medication management in two and a half weeks but it feels like an eternity. Hoping the medication along with therapy and coaching will help me figure things out. Currently seeing a psychologist for CBT who is a great help for dealing with anxiety. I had an evaluation with another psychologist who has ADHD. I would like to go back for coaching because there are strategies I could learn. Most of my advice is centered around working as that has been my greatest source of stress.

Lessons learned:

- Walk backward through the event - What caused it? What preceded it? How could you adjust your environment and behaviors to have a better outcome?

- Let go of the shame, guilt, fear. If you feel anxiety rising then try breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation. Practice this outside of times of stress.

- Break big scary projects down into manageable pieces and begin. I often avoid this step because I don't even want to think about the project because I get overwhelmed sometimes (see breathing and PMR).

- Take care of yourself physically. It is hard to make good habits and easy to fall back but have a healthy diet (low carb, high protein, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables), exercise (do what you enjoy or mix it up), and work on good sleep hygiene (go to bed and get up at the same time everyday, have a pre-bedtime ritual - no screen time).

- Learn to say no. Don't take on too much so you don't fail. Success is the antidote to low self-esteem.

- Ask for help when you need it. I let myself become ashamed or embarrassed because I need help or need help at the last minute.

- Create a daily ritual/habit so you don't have to worry about forgetting things - it's already part of your habit!

- Don't be afraid to try a new strategy. Don't write anything off. Maybe it needs to be adjusted to fit you.

- Yoga and meditation. Find a place of calm and contentment.

- Sometimes just getting started helps keep the ball rolling on something that feels insurmountable. It's tough but sometimes it pays off.

- Set aside time to work and take breaks (pomodoro technique). Give yourself active breaks like a walk (I tend to stare at a computer all day).

- Keep track of your activities and what you have done so you feel a sense of accomplishment rather than focusing on what you still haven't done yet.

- Use natural deadlines to help keep yourself in check. Eg. I won't have lunch until I write a paragraph. 

- Externalize your memory. I use my online calendar to remind me of everything.

- Stay engaged in the conversation (work). I like to take notes so I force myself to stay engaged.

- Try to either pick the low hanging fruit by getting the easy stuff done first (Look at how successful you are! Keep it up!). Alternatively, ""eat the frog"" and get the worst part of a task over with so there are better things to come.

- Don't beat yourself up. Take responsibility for your actions but learn from your mistakes. ",2015-07-27 18:07:56+00:00,cti0c4d,5,t1_cthzac5,1481,ADHD
1257,"If you're stuck because you're having trouble getting a particular topic then reach out on forums online. I get easily frustrated and I hate asking for help. Shame of failure/embarrassment that I don't get it easily? I don't really understand the logic but it is a pattern for me anyway. Maybe you just need a little nudge so you can feel like you're getting it again? Alternatively, if you are struggling with keeping engaged in the activity then you could try the pomodoro technique.",2015-07-27 13:54:03+00:00,cthqkye,1,t3_3erlf7,3679,ADHD

1261,Hey there. Speaking from experience... Panicking is likely a function of your ADHD. You know you have failed in the past. You're (rightly) afraid of failing again. I started seeing a therapist because of my performance and work-related anxiety. I found it difficult to plan ahead and would freeze up when I had a project to work on. I could finally engage at the last minute. I thought it was because the projects made me anxious. I found out that it was ADHD that was keeping me from accomplishing what I needed to do. Anxiety was a natural response to the situation. It took a long time to figure out that the root of my anxiety was actually ADHD. ,2015-07-27 02:01:56+00:00,cthb11f,3,t1_ctgrp57,34655,ADHD
1262,"It seems like I might be the first to suggest trying to establish good sleep hygiene. Set a bed time and wake time to keep to every day. Start preparing for bed an hour early. Don't use your computer, phone, tv or any other screen device 1 hour before bed. Have a bedtime habit or ritual that helps set your brain into sleep mode. It will be a struggle. Good habits are hard to form and it is easy to fall back into old habits. This will have benefits beyond getting up on time. You will have more energy and better health long term if you stick to a regular sleep schedule. If only I could stick to my sleep schedule...",2015-07-27 01:54:25+00:00,cthas28,1,t3_3emtu5,73923,ADHD
1263,"Set a timer for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever. Pick a spot or area of your room to work on for that amount of time. Repeat over days, weeks, whatever. Some progress will may make you feel better and you may get on a roll and continue. Any progress is better than not doing anything! Alternatively, make a list of what you want to accomplish so you break down ""cleaning your room"" (or whatever) into small steps. You can pick one step or task and just do that one thing. If you want to keep going then great. ",2015-07-27 01:37:03+00:00,ctha6ux,1,t3_3eiec7,176217,ADHD
