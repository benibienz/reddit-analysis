I'm VLC/NC with my uBPD mother. I only see a future of NC unless she is able to make changes with therapy. I don't want to engage with her right now as I focus on my own priorities but I've been thinking about it on and off. I can see two arguments very clearly.

Do it - she could go to therapy, recognize that the diagnosis fits, work on changing, etc. I would want to know if I were her. [This probably represents my hope for change.]

Don't do it - she wouldn't go to therapy anyway, she would reject the potential diagnosis, become more obstinate, try to lash out at me, etc. I don't owe her anything. [This probably represents my realistic perspective.]

I think that she's unable to reflect on herself and acknowledge that she's done anything wrong (beyond it was wrong but I deserved it because I hurt her feelings). I'm afraid that telling her would do more harm than good if she isn't in a place to accept it (is there ever such a time?). I guess I'm thinking I would tell her if she ever shows any remorse or desire to go to therapy.

She's getting closer to retirement age so I'm starting to consider what it will mean to have an aging parent with BPD and aging parents in general. 

I have a friend with a mother with histrionic personality disorder (HPD) around 70 years old. Her mother is living with her family, getting chemotherapy to treat her cancer, and making the house a living hell. It's really tough for my friend because she is 100% a care-taker (as she was trained-parentified). I know that my friend is really pushing herself to do what she feels is right by making sure her mother is cared for and feels bad because she knows her mother may not be around much longer. At the same time, her mother is being so much worse than normal. Her physical health is okay and the chemotherapy is going well but her mental health is at an all-time-low. I know my friend is feeling a lot of pressure and guilt so I offered her my comment that, ""I've imagined my mom accidentally falling down the stairs to her death. Not because I want her dead! I just want a break."" She laughed for about a minute. 

I worry about my aging parents and in-laws. They all want to retire early. I'm a care-taker and bleeding heart but I don't want to spend my good years caring for these people or living with them because they didn't plan well for their retirement. It's a weird place to be as a somewhat young professional myself. It's not my place to tell them how to live or retire right now but I know that I may be asked to help later as a result of their decisions. I tell my husband that on no uncertain terms that I won't be taking care of them because I feel I will get weak if they actually need help. I feel like a care facility would be the only solution if they can't live on their own.

I know I shouldn't worry because whatever will be will be. I spent too much time talking with my mom this weekend trying to explain downsides of buying a vacation home. I don't want it to be another thing that she wants help maintaining or another way to spend time with her on her terms. I'm done with feeling guilty about not helping her maintain her home. She can either do it herself, pay for help, or change her living situation. A ""shared"" family vacation home would be another way to expect spending time together and maintaining her stuff. I'm done with family vacations where I feel trapped with her.

I wanted to share the link below with advice about how to break this cycle and escape the triangle in case anyone else has this problem.

The cycle

My mother has BPD and she thinks of herself as ""fly paper"" where everything bad sticks to her. She is always the ""victim"". I recognized that she always found a way to make herself into a victim. She would treat people badly, they would eventually react badly to her, she would feel attacked, then cry victim. I don't think she knows that she was causing these problems. I found myself stuck validating her feelings that yes, this person wronged her but it ignored her role in finding a ""persecutor"". She kept coming to me to help her solve her problems. I recognized that these problems kept happening like social interaction whack-a-mole. She kept getting into dramatic exchanges. 

My role

I know now that I was her ""rescuer"" that would validate her feelings, support her, give her the attention she wanted, and unintentionally encourage more of this behavior. I had a big role to play in this drama triangle. I feel like understanding this has really helped me acknowledge my role in enabling her. I didn't want to keep helping her because it was a drain on my time and emotional resources but I felt that is what a ""good daughter"" would do in a healthy relationship. I thought, ""Everyone needs support when they're upset, right?""

What to do

I wasn't helping anything. I didn't really help her solve her own problems. I was making the situation worse and actually encouraging her fighting with other people by giving her extra attention. Finding the term to describe this situation felt so significant to me but having a name for it doesn't stop it. I found the resource below from bpdfamily.com that frames the issue in the context of being in a drama triangle with someone with BPD (which is helpful for me because my mom has uBPD). As a ""rescuer"", you're in the greatest position of power to break up the drama triangle. I always felt powerless but I feel empowered because I know what to do now. I hope this helps someone as much as I feel it has helped me!

You don't want to jump into going to college (or back to college or grad school) and acquiring debt (or spending your savings) without a direction or goal. Remember that a subject you may enjoy studying in college may not translate into a job or career that you want. 

Advice:

- Don't start school until you have a plan. Know what classes you want to explore specifically for a major (2 or 3 options at most) before you sign up for any classes.

- Read some books at the library in areas of interest to you. See if you're actually interested or just superficially interested.

- Research career options in the areas of interest to you. **(See https://www.onetonline.org/ or http://www.bls.gov/bls/occupation.htm and type in your occupation of interest for information about salary, education, skills, expected growth, etc.)**

- Consider looking for a (or keeping your) job with tuition remission. Many companies will help pay for school while you work for them.

- You will change your mind. You will change your plan. **You need a plan and a goal or else you will find yourself in trouble.** Be willing to explore but pick a direction and go with it.",ADHD,PSA: Choosing a College Major or a Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/3ovgbh/psa_choosing_a_college_major_or_a_career/

- Sleep: Sleep quality and quantity is important. Sleep at the same time every night. Sleep debt is difficult to repay. Reduce exposure to screens an hour before bed.

- Diet: Eat a healthy diet with low carbs, lots of vegetables, and protein. Drink water too! Eat until you're 75% full. More frequent, smaller meals may be better than larger meals. Don't over- or under-eat.

- Exercise: Exercise every day, preferably 30-60 minutes of moderate or vigorous exercise. Lifting weights is a good idea. Maybe low impact exercise is better for you and your joints? Find an activity that you enjoy that will keep you active. Don't sit all day even if you work in an office because sitting is killing us. Walk to the printer or bathroom on another floor and take walking breaks.

- Stress: Don't stress. Exercise, write, play music, draw, go to therapy, or do whatever helps you reduce stress in a healthy way! 

If you do these things now, your medication will be more effective, your health risks will be lower, you will have more energy, you will live longer.

We always let work, family, play, or other responsibilities and/or excuses get in the way of our basic needs. Take care of yourself. It's not that hard but it will have tremendous benefits.

**Issue:** Well-meaning BPD mom loves me and my sibling and wants to travel and spend time with us. We've basically all she has for friends and family. We really don't like spending much time with her (short visits are better) and traveling with her is a combination of appeasing her and trying to keep her from going off the rails. How do we manage not traveling with her and not hurting her feelings?

-------

She doesn't recognize that she is volatile and difficult on trips which is made worse by her alcoholism. She has her own agenda and gets bored easily but wants us to plan things to just blow those plans off when we are on vacation. She has expensive tastes in places to eat and stay but can afford it. My sibling and I are adults but are not well established so we can't afford much of anything. 

This creates an awkward relationship where she wants to travel and knows we can't afford to vacation the way she would like. She typically pays for plane tickets and a place for us to stay but she expects a lot for it. She ends up acting as if we owe her before, during, and after the trip. It essentially becomes a wonderful vacation for her where she makes no compromises on plans or activities, sets the schedule, decides when/where we eat/drink. We spend our ""vacation"" trying to anticipate her needs and keep her happy. There is almost always a few meltdowns on her part where we upset her over something small and it makes the experience very stressful. 

I don't mean to sound ungrateful. We have seen some neat things that I wouldn't be able to visit on my own. However, it is not relaxing and I would rather not go. This would be the first time I've declined to go on a trip. She doesn't want to travel on her own but doesn't have anyone else to share it with. I wish I were in a place financially to afford to vacation together, apart so we could meet to do things but not be stuck with her.

I feel very sorry for her as I know she struggles with the sense of abandonment. I already live a few hours away and don't see her nearly as often as she would like. She would prefer that my sibling and I live at home so we could be both her best friends and personal assistants. It's tough to establish healthy boundaries and I feel a bit stuck.

**More context:** I talk with her on the phone 1-3 times a week. I try to balance between keeping the conversation superficial and not being too withholding of any information about my life. It seems that this is the balance for me.

I found these two places which seem okay. Tully Lake seems like a classic camping situation, on top of a lake, somewhat private sites, parking is only at the entry. Dunes Edge is nice because it is near a few beaches and Provincetown but the sites are small and not private.

I want to get the bare bones so I can add as I figure out what I would use and need. I think I need sleeping bags, pads, an LED lamp, and a 4 person tent to start.

BUY? BUY USED? RENT?

I'm not sure how much I will end up camping so I'm debating how to approach getting basic camping gear. I don't want to spend a ton and I'm a grad student so my budget is small. Effective and cheap are the key because I won't be toting it around. Should I rent gear, buy used, or buy new? Do you think I should rent to see how I like it or jump in with buying the basics so I have them for a while?

Any recommendations on where to rent? 
Any recommendations about buying used? Things to look out for? 
Any recommendations on brands/products to buy new? I would want something solid rather than cheap junk. 

Thank you so much!!!

Here I am. The day of the meeting, just sending it out, unable to really proofread because I'm so overly tired. I feel terrible about it. It was due 7 days ago (after I asked for more time once previously). I let myself down again. I am not on meds yet but I hope to be soon. I have CBT but it seems like a recurring issue that I can't break. It seems like intense pressure is the only thing that gets me to finally do it.

I've been seeing a clinical psychologist but she doesn't prescribe medication so I've been referred to an APRN for medication management. I'm feeling a bit nervous because I don't know what to expect and I don't have any questions ready. I think they will try to confirm my dx of ADHD during the first appointment. I hope I can also leave with a prescription. It will be my first time trying meds.

Used to cycle a lot but I haven't in years. Price range is limited/second hand is fine but updating my bike and saving would be better. Fitness and pleasure will be my main uses. Pavement and trails will be the primary conditions. 

If you recommend switching tires, do you have a recommendation on types/sizes? How much will it cost?

If you recommend buying a hybrid, any specific bikes come to mind as being inexpensive but solid? I don't need anything top of the line but I don't want a Huffy.

He liked the Cannondale Quick 6 (a bit sportier) (~$480) over the Specialized (Sirius?) hybrid (~$520). I'm hesitant to spend the money on a new bike when he hasn't ridden in over 10 years. I would like to know that he would use it. I see the Trek 7.0 FX  is cheaper at $380. 

Do you have any recommendations for him? 

I have been looking on Craigslist but it seems like a lot of junk bikes that would need work, bikes that are nearly the same price as new, and expensive (2k+) bikes. I guess buying a bike as an adult is a fairly good investment because it will last for life if you take care of it. I'm just frugal and don't want to spend a lot for something if it will just sit and rust. 

Also, a healthy weight for him will likely be around 240lb (based on body fat) according to the doctor so he will still need a supportive bike even after losing some weight. He has an old knee injury so biking may be a good way for him to stay active without putting the extra stress on his knee.


EDIT: I guess he is looking at flat barred road bikes based on this description:

Flat bared road bike

1) Rigid fork, sometimes carbon

2) direct pull brakes but sometimes disc brakes

3) threadless stem

4) no suspension seat post

5) Narrower saddle

6) 700c hybrid wheel, 25 - 28mm tires, slick or slick/inverted tread.",whichbike,Heavy rider looking for a hybrid for fitness,http://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/3fwssv/heavy_rider_looking_for_a_hybrid_for_fitness/
