I don't think I get along well with the people but, the tuition is cheap and its the only school I can go too.  

The thing is that everyone here is in cliques and I just don't fit in.  I need help fitting in with people because everyone seems to know everyone.  There are really no extra curricular activities/clubs around.  I have been here for 6 months now and I still feel completely alone.  Any advice on what I should do?
