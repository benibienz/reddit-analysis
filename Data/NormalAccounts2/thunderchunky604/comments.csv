8,"I've had this guy about 6 months and worn it pretty much everyday. It fit perfectly on my Seiko skx007 but I decided to switch bracelets. It has some scratches from desk diving but nothing that a little love and patience can't correct. 

It looks like a new one from Amazon would cost $55.99 plus shipping so I'll let this one go for $40. Shipping is from 11238 and I'm happy to arrange for local pickup in NYC.",2016-06-11 18:37:37+00:00,d454s00,1,t3_4nmlgq,278,Watchexchange

10,I know exactly how you feel. I was a bicycle mechanic while I was in school and grad school. Now I work in advertising which offers new challenges pretty frequently but the corporate bureaucracy makes me sick to my stomach.,2016-02-25 22:20:43+00:00,d0dtxke,1,t3_47l4r2,7433,intj
11,"I had this same problem for a long time. It really weighed on me through grad school. It wasn't until I graduated and realized that taking care of myself through relaxation, exercise and socializing were in fact a productive use of my time. In my opinion, living a balanced life is more perfect than living a strictly efficient one.",2016-01-18 16:16:11+00:00,cz2stk6,1,t3_41hwh9,31954,intj
