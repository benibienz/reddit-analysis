16,"But which one rather? Already got Tadic, but Soton might go full blast and ManU usually has goal ceiling. Althougj I'd expect Martial to be inolved if there are any goals. Also if I get Martial I play Townsend and if I get Long I play Carroll.",2016-05-14 22:01:45+00:00,d35oakm,3,t1_d35lusy,4372,FantasyPL
17,"Are any of Vardy, Martial or Long worth the -4? My front 8 is Tadic, Sanchez, Ozil, Townsend, Hazard, Aguero, Carroll, Defoe. Benching Defoe. Could get Vardy or Long in for Defoe and play Carroll instead of Townsend. Or get Martial for Carroll and play Townsend. I guess here the question also is whether Carroll or Townsend is a better bet. 1p behing the leader in my ML, so rather hesitant to take a hit and instead play Carroll and Townsend. Thoughts?",2016-05-14 20:43:12+00:00,d35lns9,1,t3_4j7gmt,97460,FantasyPL

20,Townsend vs Defoe? Reid vs PvA? Leaning towards Townsend and Reid myself due to Sunderland's rotation risk.,2016-05-14 11:41:26+00:00,d355jb5,1,t3_4j7gmt,64954,FantasyPL
21,"My front 8 is Payet, Hazard, Ozil, Sanchez, Townsend, Carroll, Aguero and Defoe. Thinking of Defoe to Long and then either to play Carroll or Townsend. Rather Townsend? Or are there any other options? 0.3 ITB. 1p behind the leader. Was also considering Townsend and Defoe to Tadic and Long, but not sure if it's worth the -4.",2016-05-13 22:19:57+00:00,d34m70e,1,t3_4j7gmt,16865,FantasyPL

23,"He has actually played a lot recently, so wouldn't be super surprised if he was brought in on HT or subbed off after 60 mins if he starts. But probably I'm wrong and you're right.",2016-05-05 21:16:21+00:00,d2ubxyp,2,t1_d2ubsq5,200,FantasyPL

30,"Well I'll only need 1 transfer before GW30 to field 11 players (and if Arsenal plays then none). But there is CL, FA cup, and League Cup in the meanwhile, so there's possibility for injuries, etc, so probably might keep that 1 extra FT.",2016-02-22 19:58:26+00:00,d09nee2,2,t1_d09iub9,6239,FantasyPL

32,"Play one: Ozil vs Ighalo? It's easy just between them (Ozil), but I also have Sanchez, so I would still have Arsenal coverage if I benched Ozil and Arsenal did well.

34,"Hmm. Maybe instead get in Daniels for next 2 GWs? He has Sunderland and palace away + is cheaper. I need a temporary good defender, who I can later switch to Targett or some other low value. Getting in Daniels today (before the price rise) would allow me to get Sanchez in later if a need shall occur.",2016-01-18 18:16:35+00:00,cz2xmnn,4,t1_cz2xc1r,434,FantasyPL

36,"Thought so as well, but noticed that Jagielka reclaimed his starting spot at the same time Coleman got injured. Perhaps it just happened to be at the same time Jagielka also go fit then... In this case he is probably a great long-term shout for an Everton defender as well (in terms of price). Will get him in for 2 next GWs and if Everton do well defensively might even keep him for longer.",2016-01-18 18:02:09+00:00,cz2x1l0,2,t1_cz2wuee,289,FantasyPL
