I will only choose 3 defenders.
Definitely going with Moreno and Alderweireld because of great form and fixtures. Not that sure about Kolarov vs Bellerin. Man city facing Stoke while missing Hart and Kompany, so reduced chances of clean sheet, but Kolarov has big attacking potential. Arsenal facing Sunderland and are missing Coquelin, Cazorla, and quite possibly Koscielny. Although Bellerin also has attacking potential, Kolarov has proved it more on paper.
What do you think? Bellerin vs Kolarov?",FantasyPL,This week's defensive puzzle,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/3vbjem/this_weeks_defensive_puzzle/
