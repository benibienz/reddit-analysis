He doesn't, as you suggest, conflate a decrease in insulin in the T1 body with insulin resistance, he merely points out that insulin resistance is a factor in the long term for T1 patients - something that isn't well understood among T1 patients and is missed by doctors with disturbing frequency. 

Alzheimer's as T3 diabetes may not be mainstream thinking amongst frontline doctors but it is very much mainstream thinking among diabetes researchers - the body of published and cited research is so wide that it will in all likelihood be accepted science once larger studies complete. The idea that Type 4 exists in mice *is* accepted science and mice are the best model we have for this disease in humans, if proven in humans this might explain the large number of older lean T2 patients.

Finally gestational diabetes isn't pre-diabetes but it does highlight an increased risk of T2 for the patient. I disagree with your assessment that it is 'often' a precursor - the best research on the topic suggests only a 5th of gestational diabetes patients develop T2.",2016-06-07 12:19:34+00:00,d3zcexg,2.0,t1_d3yy54p,35297.0,bestof

Although it's true that people made the same argument you do now about Apple's Joint Venture with VSLI and Acorn to develop the ARM processor for the Newton - now the great-grandchild of that processor is in every mobile phone. 

The real case in point is Xerox. They developed the basic ideas - laser printers, inkjet printers, graphical interfaces, mice, networking - that once commercialised would form the modern computing environment that we know today. Xerox's business guys lacked the vision to turn those ideas into products and the sales people could only measure the future in copier consumables.

Its computing lore that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs turned Xerox's reasearch ideas into reality; although the Macintosh's UI was in development months before Job's [PARC visit in 1979](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/parc.html).

The arguments I've seen put forward about passenger capacity fundamentally misunderstand the issue; capacity is mostly about the *number and frequency of trains you can run on a piece of track*, as well as the number of passengers you can fit on a train. The more overcrowded in terms of trains a stretch of track becomes, the more frequently slow multistop local services obstruct fast long distance trains and vice versa.

The now upgraded West Coast Mainline, which is used both by local franchises and long distance operators, will near its total possible capacity for trains (not passengers) within 10 years, the only way to relieve that is to build another major trunk route to serve the Northern cities leaving the East and West Coast Lines to deal with the remainder of the traffic going to Scotland and the coasts. This will also enable the short distance operators that rely on the WCML to run faster more frequent commuter services in the already at passenger capacity evening rush hour, and create new commuter trains that service the growing belt an hour outside Marylebone.

In short it's the reason we built the M40 despite the fact that much of the M40 route is also served by the M1 and M6 - the arguments presented against the phases of the M40 are much the same as those being flung at HS2.

HS2 will achieve a number of other things as well as a new trunk route, major projects are always about about more than one thing - but the biggest single factor is the capacity of the long distance Network to carry trains.

The argument put forward in this article is at best confused mumbo jumbo, some of the facts are right but the conclusion is nonsense, it's just a lot of post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after this therefore because of this) bullshit.  

A further chunk of the HS2 scheme is about enabling businesses to move between the Northern cities and London more quickly, potentially allowing more London headquartered businesses to move their back office functions North rather than move them into Eastern Europe (which is the current trend). We also need to deal with the fact that the Northern cities are growing and the faster link to London will greatly improve that situation even if the journey time is not significantly shorter than it is now.",2016-01-11 16:34:11+00:00,cyu5o6q,4.0,t1_cyu1070,8268.0,technology

This is the failure of understanding that pervades the national press and uninformed commentary - we have forgotten the era when the state built the national infrastructure that we rely on today because that infrastructure was uneconomic to any other entity. 

Equally we have forgotten that we gave away the railway, water and energy infrastructure to private enterprise in order to allow them to turn a profit on it and on the very thin hypothesis that they run it more efficiently. If the railway operators actually had to pay the full costs of the trains, stations, track and signalling, maintenance and upgrades they would go bankrupt in days.

Likewise with this technology, the long term benifits of its use are huge for the environment, industry, councils and the general public. The fact that it brings dead land back into economic use alone makes the investment worthwhile but the initial investment is so massive that its unprofitable in the short and medium term and the real benifits are reaped by the economy and planet as a whole not the single operator of a facility.

This was late in the war, but the debate about whether or not to attempt to kill Hitler runs through many of the allied war plans from the earliest stages of the conflict. 

Germany relied on Blitzkrieg, literally 'lighting war' understood as fast moving overwhelming force, [Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war), and new [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_technology_during_World_War_II#Armoured_vehicles) as a path to military success. As the war drew on and became increasingly tactical so Hitler's [drug addictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Morell#Substances_given_to_Hitler) and paranoia (he was literally on Meth) also increased, he failed to listen to good advice from his commanders and that exposed his own key weakness as a commander - he surrounded himself with 'yes men' no one was really able to tell him the truth. The allies were consistently able to take advantage of this by feeding [mis-information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Chapman#Return_to_London) on bombing successes, and [disinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat) that flattered the German war effort. Essentially taking advantage of both Hitler and the German war machine's collective hubris. There is obviously much more to it than that but Hitler's own weaknesses were an essential part of the allied victory.

&gt;The plan [Operation Foxley] was submitted in November 1944, but was never carried out because controversy remained over whether it was actually a good idea to kill Hitler: he was by then considered to be such a poor strategist that it was believed whoever replaced him would probably do a better job of fighting the allies. Thornley also argued that Germany was almost defeated and, if Hitler were assassinated, he would become a martyr to some Germans, and possibly give rise to a myth that Germany might have won if Hitler had survived. Since the idea was not only to defeat Germany but to destroy Nazism in general, that would have been a highly undesirable development. However, there were strong advocates on both sides, and the plan never became operational simply because no actual decision was reached. In any case, Hitler left the Berghof for the last time on 14 July 1944, never to return, and committed suicide in Berlin on 30 April 1945, a few days before the war in Europe ended.

Basically you'd need to get someone to name a planet, mineral, substance or a geographical region after Lemmy and then persuade the scientist to name the element after that. Alternatively you could just get the discoverer to change his own name...

- After IUPAC decides who deserves the credit for the discovery, the discoverers receive the right to suggest a name.

- It is desirable that the names of elements in different languages differ as little as possible.

- In keeping with tradition, elements are named after a mythological concept or character (including an astronomical object); a mineral, or similar substance; a place or geographical region; a property of the element; or a scientist.

- The names of new element should end in “-ium.” (A 2015 proposal wants names of elements 117 and 118 to have different endings, “-ine” and “-on” respectively.)

- Once the discovery of the element is confirmed and before its name is approved, the element will be referred to by its number or a provisional name (ununoctium).

- The final name is dependent on the IUPAC’s approval, and IUPAC has the right to disregard the discoverer.

- When a name has been in unofficial use for a particular element, but a different name is ultimately chosen for that element, then the first name cannot be transferred for use for another element.

101,"There is an asinine belief that Type 2 is only caused by overeating and obesity and that its intrinsically linked to sugar consumption - neither of these things is true. Weight increases your risk factors for Type 2 but this is correlation rather than causation, and it may very well be the case that weight is a symptom of the disease. Kylie Minogue is Hyperglycaemic and will likely develop Type 2 as she becomes older, Sir Steve Redgrave is a Type 2 diabetic, neither is overweight or unfit.

As many as 20% of Type 2 diabetics inherited the condition (MODY diabetics), and as research into the disease continues there is substantial evidence that as much as 50% of Type 2's have an auto-immune disease just the same as Type 1 and 1.5 diabetics. There is also a growing body of evidence that Alzheimer's disease is caused by insulin resistance in the brain and is being termed Type 3 diabetes in over 2000 cited research papers.

Morbidly obese people are no more likely to be diabetic than people who put on an extra stone around the middle in early middle age in fact the group most at risk is the latter one - people don't go around shaming them. 

TL;DR where obesity and Type 2 diabetes is concerned the link is correlation rather than causation, and the actual link is with *where* the weight is. The most at risk group are apparently heathy people who put on less than 1 stone around their waist in early middle age.

&gt;Placing a rumen fistula — the medical term for a permanent hole between an internal organ and the outside world — into a healthy cow for collection purposes is a relatively straightforward procedure and performed frequently at veterinary schools, according to Dr. Brian Aldridge, clinical professor and specialist in large animal internal medicine at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Illinois. “To put one in would take about an hour and a half,” he says.

&gt;Rumen flora from a fistulated cow helps not only sick cows, but also sheep and goats because they share similar digestive systems. “Our vet school always has a fistulated cow,” Aldridge says. “The bovine GI surgery patients routinely get a transfaunation because it’s been shown that the recovery rate and return to appetite and milk production is much greater if you reestablish the gut flora.”

- The only election where the membership has disagreed with the PLP is the most recent. 

- Both the membership and the PLP would have elected David Miliband over Ed.

- The only leader elected exclusively on the affiliate vote was Ed Miliband, Kinnock won all three electoral college groups, eliminating the affiliate vote from both of his elections would still have resulted in a Kinnock leadership.

- The Conservative Party leadership contests were Parliamentary Party only until 2001, their membership disagreed with the PCP right out of the gate electing IDS over the MP's choice of Portillo, Howard ran unopposed in 2003, and Cameron was the choice of both the membership and MPs. So the Conservative membership have also only chosen one election winning leader in the entire history of their party.

Looking at the margin of victory for each of the elections you could make the argument that the PLP nomination process results in poor candidate choices - only one election was close run.

From the [published paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/22/1518445113) (I reccomend reading the abstract):
&gt;Modern Europe has been shaped by two episodes in prehistory, the advent of agriculture and later metallurgy. These innovations brought not only massive cultural change but also, in certain parts of the continent, a change in genetic structure. The manner in which these transitions affected the islands of Ireland and Britain on the northwestern edge of the continent remains the subject of debate. The first ancient whole genomes from Ireland, including two at high coverage, demonstrate that large-scale genetic shifts accompanied both transitions. We also observe a strong signal of continuity between modern day Irish populations and the Bronze Age individuals, one of whom is a carrier for the C282Y hemochromatosis mutation, which has its highest frequencies in Ireland today.

Whale meat is to Japan what canned SPAM was to the British during the second world war; protien.

Socio-economic; there are generations of people who have grown into the whaling industry and would have no other means of earning a living without it. There are also dealers, specialist restaurants and other businesses that exist only to supply the whaling fleets, and a section of government bureaucracy dedicated to its existence.

Think of it like a large town with a single employer - the employer goes bust, so do the businesses that supply that employer, then the employees and the town go bust as well. The government then has to step in and fund welfare for those affected and regeneration projects for the towns.

IMO it's not so simple to just stop whaling because you'll take a decent chunk of your economy and render many towns and townspeople bankrupt along with it.

Our problems are indeed their problems, and all of the points raised in these debates cut both ways.

This policy avoids a lot of petty and unnecessary bureaucracy - countries paying out money and then having to claim it back from the parent country of the citizen, or having to have a system where your own citizens can claim benefits while living abroad. It also avoids the UK having to answer the question 'if you pay benefits to citizens living in the EU and pensioners living in any country, then why not pay benefits to citizens living elsewhere'.

As usual there are significant downsides to changing the current situation and the UK hasn't thought them through.

The PLP were stunned to find that the party membership had moved on and were not prepared to listen to the same old machine politics any longer.

Ed Miliband turned out to be very competent glue - managing the behind the scenes conflicts successfully but lacking the vision, power or mandate to really change the direction of the parliamentary party and resolve the old internecine conflicts.

Sadly it seems they didn't get the memo and have simply dug their heels into rejectionism - unable to fully comprehend the failure of their preferred candidates. 

The handling of Indyref was an unmitigated disaster - Ed should have resigned over it - it showed that the party was not a credible force in Scotland any longer and that our Scottish old guard were hopelessly out of touch with modern Scotland.

267,"While that's true the 'success' of getting so many votes disguised the fact that Farage's General Election campaign was a complete disaster. 

UKIP were beaten into third by Labour in half their target seats, lost huge vote share based on their previous GE performances, almost half a million voters who were prepared to support UKIP at the euro elections failed to show up, the voters of Thanet elected a UKIP council (whose majority has since dissolved) but spurned Farage in enormous numbers, and their two elected MPs lost massive numbers of supporters after just 6 months in the job. Croydon Central was a devastating blow - a city location where they had huge putative support delivered only 4,800 actual votes.

- UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote, 9% a month ago and just 7% today.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 GE and 2014 by-election performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester &amp; Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

- They lost half of their elected MP's with Reckless's 13 point defeat to an unknown Tory councillor who now holds a majority of 7,000.

- Reckless had a 2920 majority, which he turned into a 7133 deficit, and Carswell's 12,404+ majority was reduced to a mere 3437. This takes Clacton from a safe UKIP seat to the 20th most marginal seat in the country.

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as ""a failure"". This is the reason there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation.

On top of all of that, just as 9 of Farage's 12 MEP's did following the 2009 Euro elections, Thanet's Council has seen multiple defections to the point where its majority is now gone.

275,"&gt;How poor could your record keeping possibly be if you forget where you found the 25 skeletons?

It's possibly unfair of the Guardian to characterise this as poor record keeping as its a problem born of how you orient a map. Here in London most of our major utility pipework and cabling was laid in two phases; the Victorian era and in the 1980s - both pre GPS eras. 

The Victorian maps exist but are oriented by above ground landmarks very few of which remain in place (war and construction). The pipework laid in the 80s has that problem and a new one - the new fangled plastic pipes are undetectable to cheap handheld scanners. You can use ground penetrating radar but that costs £2000 per street.

The upshot is that the water and power companies know roughly where to look for the pipes and trunks but not exactly, and this is why they end up digging a lot of holes that seem meaningless to the casual onlooker. 

Somewhere under South London there is a trillion litre underground reservoir that we've lost! A similar one in North London was found but as the engineering is pressure based they broke it in the act of locating it. So the big water companies employ teams of historians, landscape archaeologists and engineering experts whose job it is to figure out how the Victorians made this all work without pumps, where it all is, and to recover lost engineering knowledge.

TL;DR the landscape changed so the maps no longer make sense and we've forgotten how a lot of the Victorian engineering actually worked.

Riots usually, especially in this country, inspire changes in policing and public policy towards the communities involved.

We got the late 90s threat assessment so wrong that we ordered almost 400 tanks which we've used once in 2003, and failed to replace the Snatch Land Rover. This forced us to rush the Ocelot into service following dozens of deaths.

We supported the Libyan invasion by flying air launched Cruise missiles all the way from England because we took our last carrier out of service to save money.

Lower peaks mean less unit shipments and that is all - Apple is simply more successful during peak seasons.

Trying to turn that into some kind of [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) conspiracy theory suggesting that Apple is deliberately outmoding hardware is, as I said, silly - that same accusation has been levelled at whomever is the market leader since consumer PCs became popular. Hell they used to make the same dumb accusation about Ford and GM.

If you don't want the update, don't install it (Apple consumers have a choice, Android consumers don't), but don't expect an operating system designed for a device with orders of magnitude more processing and graphics power to work as well with the new OS as the old.

Yes, it's almost as if manufacturers release new handsets seasonally based on contract expiry information provided by the networks. 

I really don't understand what you see a unit shipment graph as evidence of? The peaks and troughs match for each company because they all operate in virtually the same way, releasing flagship phones within a few months of each other. Samsung is slightly different because it sells so many bottom end phone models and therefore has more consistent unit shipments.

&gt;I'd rather take a delayed patch than a whole new OS version that cripples my hardware and forces me to buy a new one prematurely.

For one thing it's actually possible to put a current iOS on old Apple hardware - you can't do that with Android at all. For another iOS 9 runs beautifully on my 4s, 5, and 6, at the worst you have disable some animation effects so it 'feels' faster. Performance wise iOS 8 and 9 were pretty good on a 4 year old phone, same goes for the iPad, where support extends back to 2011 models contrary to your Guardian article. That is a level of support which is certainly more than Microsoft ever achieved for 4 or 5 year old PC hardware.

Are people shocked that an old piece of hardware that is a couple of orders of magnitude less powerful than new hardware doesn't run a modern OS version as well as the hardware it was designed for? I hope not because they'll be consistently disappointed by every piece of computer hardware ever made especially now everything is encrypted by default.

So even Cameron's own estimate of £23 billion is £68.2 Billion to £74.2 Billion or £2.5 Billion a year - and that doesn't account for inflation or changing project costs.

317,"So we should spend £167 Billion over 30 years, or £5.56 Billion a year, on this weapon in order to ensure we have a moderate stance? I don't buy into that argument at all.

 - In the 80s Trident was geopolitically vital to secure our positions on the UN security council and in NATO, that isn't the case in 2015.


 - From a military standpoint it's an ineffective system that offers nothing to the national defense when you examine the strategic threats we face.

 - A system with only 8 missiles, 30 warheads, and a single submarine on active patrol - which is the spec of the new system according to the SDSR - is virtually useless in a nuclear attack compared to any other nuclear power's systems. 

 - If you buy into Cameron's allegedly moderate 'we must live within our means' argument how do you justify the cost?

 - As a significant NATO member we remain covered by other country's nuclear weapons so Trident has nothing to do with unilateral disarmament or MAD.

 - We can't assemble the warheads, update the submarine weapons pod and firing system design or use the normal guidance system without American parts or data. Targeting, outside of a doomsday scenario, sits with the Supreme Commander NATO Allied Forces Europe. That being the case, from a political standpoint, we can't fire the missiles without the permission of both the USA and NATO. So we don't have an independent nuclear defense.

When you look at all of that then this has nothing whatsoever to do with unilateral disarmament and everything to do with the strategic threat assessment and the national financial position.

For the same kind of money we could build a fleet of nuclear aircraft carriers and conventionally armed guided missile destroyers, cruisers and submarines - in short replicate the USA's carrier strike groups - far more useful in challenging today's threats than any nuclear weapon.

Wind and wave power are technically complex, difficult to apply to physically small technologies, relatively expensive, somewhat unpredictable and require serious maintenance because moving parts are involved. For all these reasons, outside of major generation infrastructure, there are few opportunities in these technologies beyond their existing uses. As technologies they are evolutionary rather than revolutionary.

Solar is quite different. Investing in the technology and bringing it down to a price people can afford generates investment in improving the efficiency of solar cells - once we do have *very* efficient solar cells and a battery technology that is cheap and capable of storing the electrical output of those cells the world simply changes in an *extraordinary* way. 

Every inch of rooftop in the country can be turned into a generator feeding into the grid cheaply - the surface of every car could contribute to powering the car, windows and mirrors too! All of this reduces the demand on our existing generation and grid infrastructure, thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption.

So we need to invest in future technology and build an industry aligned with directed scientific research in order to contribute to this goal.

443,"The average private pension pot in this country is £24,000 which is augmented by the state pension.

Residential care costs average £28,500 per year rising to £37,500 if nursing is required, non-residential care averages £17,000 per year. When you add council and NHS services for pensioners to the equation councils are paying between £80 - £100,000 per year per pensioner in care costs.

The point being that no matter if you've spent a lifetime paying into the system or 5 minutes you always take out more than you put in - there is never and will never be a point in your life where you are personally funding anyone else.

In this woman's case she is working full time, paying tax, and receiving Working Tax Credits and still falls below the poverty line. Yet you feel able to claim that your needs as a taxpayer outweigh hers? An utterly facile argument.

According the ONS your household must have a gross income of £38,000 to cross the threshold from a 'taker' to a 'giver' on an annual basis, and you'll have to sustain that level of income for 20 years to simply repay the cost of your education.

We pay an average of £734,000 in tax in our lifetimes and have an average life expectancy is 81 years, so a little over £9000 in tax per year on average.

&gt;An analysis published by the charity Shelter found that homes built under the scheme in London would only be available to the richest four per cent – those on salaries of over £76,957.

Whereas Cameron claims that:

&gt;Homes would actually be cheaper than what he called the “upper limit” of house prices in the policy. 

and

&gt;“We want to see starter homes in London built for £150,000, at £200,000 so people … can stop renting and start buying.”

Yet he has set the upper limit of the price in London at £450,000 and average homes in London cost £522,000. Both prices are utterly unaffordable to average workers anywhere.

Even if what he said is true and some of the homes (there will obviously be very few) cost £150 - £200,000 you will still need a 10% deposit of £15 - £20,000 and you'll need to save for this whilst paying rent of £1000 - £1800 a month. 

Prices in my area are rising at around £75k per year, and rent is rising at £1200 per year. Pretty much everyone I know that doesn't have family money or a ludicrous salary is being chased out of the capital.

Two years ago in my area we began construction of 50 new housing association flats destined for the shared ownership market. In the two years it took to finish construction the cost of a one bed flat went from £200,000 to £350,000, those who had been promised units didn't get them because by the time they were livable they could no longer afford them.

What the Tories have done is cut local authority budgets by 50% over the last 6 years leaving many local councils floundering for funds to maintain basic services - especially in areas where there are sharp disparities in the wealth of the local population.

One area in which the current government are struggling is planning policy. Their so called 'fracking revolution' is a good example, it's stalled because local authorities retain the power to refuse planning permission for the equipment required. Similarly the Tories would like greenbelt land to be bought into use for their developer mates, but again local authorities stand in their way. 

So. What's to be done?

I agree that it is corporate welfare, but that's also a one dimensional view of what tax credits were designed to do, and one that follows the current Tory line of attack on them i.e. to justify ending credits on the grounds that they're a drain on middle class wealth, imprudent, and only good for corporates.

Tax credits were meant to tackle low wages, 'make work pay', and keep people out of unemployment, but also as a means of relieving child poverty and ensuring that children of chronically low wage parents don't end up that way themselves.

He's accused of withholding from the commission the existence of CIA plots to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Oswald's involvement in them as a sanctioned agent. Without this knowledge the commission did not know enough to ask if Oswald had accomplices in Cuba or elsewhere who wanted President Kennedy dead in retaliation for the Castro plots.

&gt; Under McCone's and Helms's direction, CIA supported the Warren Commission in a way that may best be described as passive, reactive, and selective. 

&gt;McCone judged that he should defer to the DDP's assessment that the plots to kill Castro had no bearing on the Kennedy assassination. 

The report says that information was withheld in order to keep the commission focussed on what the agency considered to be the 'best truth'; that Oswald acted alone.

&gt;The DCI was complicit in keeping incendiary and diversionary issues off the commission's agenda and focusing it on what the Agency believed at the time was the ""best truth"" that Lee Harvey Oswald, for as yet undetermined motives, had acted alone in killing John Kennedy.

This information is new and significant because, according to the report:
&gt;Despite the prominence that many conspiratorialists have given to CIA in their speculations about who killed President Kennedy and who has concealed ""the truth"" they do not accuse McCone of participating in any murder plot or coverup. 

The report makes interesting reading - particularly regarding the CIA's initial response to the attack. 

&gt; The Immediate reaction at Langley, as elsewhere In the US government was to suspect that a foreign, probably communist-directed, effort to destabilize the United States might be underway.

*[""Member States may exclude from the scope of this Directive railway undertakings whose activity is limited to the provision of solely urban, suburban or regional services.""](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31991L0440)*

The directive at issue is the [First Railway Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Railway_Directive) that was issued in the EU as the First Railway Package, and implemented in UK Law as [The Railways Infrastructure (Access and Management) Regulations 2005](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3049/contents/made) (big clue in the title there). The part at issue is [Access and transit rights](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3049/regulation/5/made).

The directive was really about ensuring the national rail freight monopolies were broken up and making certain that transnational freight and passenger services such as eurotunnel could operate without having protectionist fees levied against them. The main criticism of the FRP was that it enables transnational freight monopolies to replace national ones - which abrogates the intent of the directive. 

If nationalised services were actually forbidden SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, both state owned Train Operating Companies, could not exist in their present form.

Its also worth considering that we already have a nationalised railway. Each franchise area is effectively a state owned entity and we simply allow certain functions to be devolved to a private operator through a bidding process which runs every ten years. At the end of a franchise period the franchise reverts to the state and all its staff and assets are then given over to whomever wins the bid.

Firstly I haven't argued anywhere in this thread or elsewhere for unilateral disarmament for the sake of peace - that is simply your assumption and that assumption says a great deal about your mindset. 

&gt;North Korea is estimated to have a maximum of around 50, thats enough to devastate the south

This isn't the case. North Korea is [estimated](http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/dprk_fissile_material_production_16Aug2012.pdf) to have *enough enriched uranium* for somewhere between 14 and 48 weapons. More importantly they don't have reliable missile technology.

&gt; it survives solely on this basis.

See the Korean war. North Korea survives for much the same reason that Iran is tremendously difficult to attack: terrain, closely followed by support from China and Russia. No one wants another proxy war because no one believes that they can win it.

It's painfully obvious that territories like Ukraine (fought over since the 13th century), Libya (fought over since the Bronze Age), and Syria (fought over since the 23rd century BC) continue to be the front lines for modern strategic aggression.

In any case you fail in your dull headed MAD bluster to reveal who you think these weapons, command of which is in the hands of NATO unless the UK is wiped out, are a threat to? 

The key questions are:-

- Can we fire the weapons independently?

- Are they effective as a means of attack or defense?

Even if we dump Trident, as NATO members, we still have nuclear cover via the USA. So your idiot MAD philosophy survives. This discussion is about throwing £100 billion in cash down the toilet on a weapons system that threatens no one and that we can't actually fire.",2015-10-05 09:28:15+00:00,cvor8rf,6.0,t1_cvnq1m9,72775.0,LabourUK

Ordinarily I'd accept this as an explanation, most people would, since it's a perfectly reasonable explanation, but it isn't true.

Since I became sick nine years ago not one, but five, chronic or acute conditions have failed to be diagnosed or even recognised as possible in a GP surgery, despite my seeking help repeatedly. Most recently I was left to go blind over a two week period because my GP diagnosed an eye infection and two registrars at Moorfields concurred on two separate occasions in week - in fact I had a vastly more serious condition which a simple visual field test would have shown. Neither the GP or the Registrars had read the leading paper on the condition it transpired and because of this all three were unaware that the symptom I had was very serious indeed, despite this being an illness experienced by 1 in 10 people.

The problem, it appears to me, is that GPs and NHS staff in general use diagnostic parsimony to 'street' patients rather than order tests to check their hypothesis. The assumption is that patients with more serious conditions will return and that other NHS staff will acknowledge that, taking the later visit more seriously.

In the UK we bundled unprofitable routes along with profitable routes into the franchises, something that hasn't worked at all. Now we're having to merge franchise areas e.g. South Central and Thameslink in order to adjust for the fact that the cash cow in the SC franchise can't support the branch routes any longer - leading to poor performance and a lack of commercial interest.

But in principle, as you say, any group can bid for any franchise, and that's been the case since the 90s - it's up to DfT to consider the bid.

Corbyn is suggesting that we take the franchises into public ownership where they'll be run similarly to a not-for-profit. Part of the reason the European directive won't apply is that the entire Network is open to freight operators on an equal basis, and it will take 20 years for all the franchises to come home so competition will remain.

They were beaten into third by Labour in half their target seats, lost huge vote share based on their previous GE performances, almost half a million voters who were prepared to support UKIP at the euro elections failed to show up, the voters of Thanet elected a UKIP council but spurned Farage in enormous numbers, and their two elected MPs lost massive numbers of supporters after just 6 months in the job. Croydon Central was a devastating blow - a city location where they had huge putative support delivered only 4,800 actual votes.

- UKIP received 4,376,635 votes at the Euro Elections in 2014, a national scale election, but received 3,881,099 at the general election - a *loss* of 495,536 voters.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote, 9% a month ago and just 7% today.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 General Election performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester &amp; Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as ""a failure"".

- Corbyn is unelectable.

- Corbyn cannot be trusted.

- He worked hard to establish the policy that delivered a new nuclear plant to his constituency along with schools and hospitals, Corbyn threatens this somehow.

It's his last point I have real trouble with:- 

- He does not mention jobs in the letter at all.
- The Schools and Hospitals were built under national programmes during the Blair administration both of which were already in place when he was elected in 2005 even if the actual building work took place later on.
- Blair and Brown (the centrists parents) disagreed on nuclear policy and therefore uniformly failed to do anything to protect those jobs you're so worried about, opting for a new generation of gas power plants instead.
- The coalition and current government advanced plans to build new reactors at Moorside not Labour.
- The variety of required decommissioning work going on at Sellafield won't finish until 2098 - those jobs are safe.
- Most of Sellafield's reactors are end-of-life.
- Work on the Moorside plant won't start until 2018 and won't commence in earnest until 2020, planning and licences are still in progress, and once contracts are issued they will be very hard to break.

Apple need the government and financial system to work with them, for example, the federal government's speedy adoption of Apple pay was highly significant for Apple.

The BBC does have very high standards - I've lived in 8 countries and you really should see the alternatives! It's been a massive benefit to the economy in that we've used it to establish and support a multi-million pound TV and film industry (most significantly the training of technical staff), and it has served, or at least it used to, as a network to support and generate locally focussed programming and news when no one else could. 

Literally the only reason commercial radio and television exists in this country at all is that the BBC built and maintains the infrastructure, and the only reason you can hear Churchill's wartime speeches is that the BBC built and maintained its own archive.

But no matter what the BBC does it faces continual criticism for no other reason than the TV licence makes a few members of the awkward squad act like paying the licence fee means they have ownership of the whole thing - frankly a ridiculous and far too common notion when it comes to public services. 

Its a populist set of channels with niche parts to speak to niche audiences that no one else will. Just because you personally don't find it useful doesn't mean it isn't useful.

They're also responsible for the dreadful DESMOND courses and the utterly useless Quality of Outcomes framework - their dietary advice is 20 years out of date and many in the diabetic community find that following their advice leads to higher HbA1c, making the condition worse.

If you go an look at the actual data you'll find their figures are based on projections and not actual diagnoses. You'll also find that the majority of those projected diagnoses are in elderly patients with multiple existing conditions - there are not waves of overweight 20 - 40 year olds being diagnosed, which isn't to say that there isn't a problem in that age group that needs tackling.

There is a strong correlation in the projections between diabetes and a wide variety of mental illness and there is a provable argument that the rise is the result of poor mental health care, poor eldercare, and large numbers of people living longer.

The actual population of diabetics is 2 million, thats up by 1 million people in 10 years and that isn't a big rise compared to the USA where as much as 10% of the country have some form of the disease, it's also no surprise that the increase in lifespans directly correlates to the increase in the illness.",2015-09-01 19:17:36+00:00,cunbn67,7.0,t1_cunalrj,1581.0,unitedkingdom

Fact is the vote share GE/EE and GE/GE for UKIP show the same trends and those trends are backed up by these council results and the now precipitous decline in the polls. Its equally true that you need voters who have voted for you in the past to do so again - they are the easiest group to convince - such a large gap shows UKIP failed in its voter ID efforts.

UKIP supporters are not hearing the message they should from the general election - the campaign failed - in the four seats that the party had a chance in it lost more than 10% vote share compared to previous GE performances. The result showed that Thanet voters liked UKIP, but didn't trust Farage, and Carswell and Reckless lost huge numbers of voters in only a few months - that should be very concerning.

The hardest thing for a challenger party to do is get people to change their vote, once changed people tend to vote that way again, so it is significant that almost half a million people who had voted UKIP didn't turn out at the general. The other reason the comparison is valid is that UKIP's general election results mirror the EE/GE loss of vote share.

Anyway, feel free to ramble on, but the truth is UKIP could and should have done better than they did.

FYI Labour increased its overall vote share 1.5%, the Tories lost a similar amount, and the bottom 7 seats went blue by 900 votes. The election came down to 10,000 people in the 20 most marginal seats. 

Labour strongholds became more Red and Tory strongholds became more Blue because of the Lib Dems collapse. Labour won all of the Lab/Lib marginals, Tory's won most of the Lib/Con marginals. 

Beyond that the Tory problem for the last 20 years - two strong center left parties holding them back - reversed itself there are now two strong right wing parties holding Labour back. A Lib Dem recovery, Green surge, SNP or UKIP collapse might make for an interesting few years.

- In Thanet Farage received 16,026 votes, Thanet North and Thanet South together cast 28,123 votes for UKIP, but virtually the same area elected a UKIP council with 54,230 votes.

- UKIP was polling at 17% in January but only received 12.6% of the vote, its now hitting 9%.

- UKIP didn't get a poll bounce from the leaders debate, and actually dropped in the polls immediately after the challengers debate.

- UKIP performed poorly in all 12 of its top target seats and was beaten into *third* by Labour in half of them.

- ""We need an Australian style points based immigration system"". We've had a points based immigration system based on the Aussie system since 2008, we just added tiered visas to handle grades of temporary workers.

- He postulates its all about skills and skill shortages, but immigration is much more complex than that. In a large number of cases its about families, students, partners, entertainers, temporary workers, foreign born citizens with birthright passports and so on. He has no idea or policy to deal with these situations - all of which are beneficial to the UK economy.

- He claims that the numbers coming from inside the EU are larger than those coming from outside the EU - this isn't true either by number or trend 269,000 (EU) vs 284,000 (Non-EU), although its close.

- He says Romanian and Bulgarian migration would lead to a large number of people arriving - its only lead to 81,000 people 61% of whom come with existing job offers - far different than the millions he was claiming would arrive when talking about the issue in 2013.

The rest of the interview is just bloviating.

840,"In essence you're peddling an argument as older than slavery - black people a savages and therefore more violet than white people. The modern versions of this talking point basically say black people are more violent and the statistics show that to be the case, or that black communities have allowed a violent subculture to develop and that explains the statistics.

Lets see if it stacks up. You say 53% of homicides are committed by black people, but the actual number according to the [Department of Justice](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) is 52.5%, White people committed 45%, and 2% other races - so Black people are only 7% more likely to commit homicide than White people.

This data is weighted because only 91% or 508,568 of the estimated
565,636 murders committed between 1980 and 2008 were included in the FBI reports the data is based on and the race of the offender has been inferred - in short with a standard +/- 5% margin of error the data could show that white people committed 50% of the homicides. Also look at the trends by race on page - you'll see that during the mid-1980s to the early 1990s there is a massive peak in both black people as offenders and black people as victims. If you bought this date up to date that 7% difference would virtually disappear.

It is possible that black people are very slightly more likely to commit homicide, but bearing in mind the margin of error and the trend data which is effectively skewed by gang wars in mid-80s, it is an extremely weak connection and one disappearing year by year. 

Black people are three times more likely to be killed during an arrest than white people but responsible for only 7% more homicides than white people - that is a yawing chasm and it shows there really is a real problem in the way law enforcement is behaving towards offenders.",2015-08-16 18:35:57+00:00,cu52ce3,12.0,t1_cu4fugs,61038.0,news

Since the bedroom tax happened she is now expected to pay another £60 per month because she has a specially adapted house and there are no one bedroom properties available so she's now mounting up arrears at the rate of £42 per month on rent alone.

This is the nonsense of the current government's system.

None of these define what is a safe country or make any mention of 'first' country. Doing so would be impractical from a number of perspectives.

Within the EU the Schengen Agreement ensures there is no right to keep applying in different EU countries if an application is rejected (which is one of the many reasons we shouldn't have opted out), and the main rules on who handles applications are laid down in [Dublin Convention](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:41997A0819(01)) which, again, doesn't specify anything regarding first countries or safe countries - so I suspect the Beeb are wide of the mark on this one.

The Ferguson rioting was not just about Michael Brown, but about the treatment of the whole community for a sustained period of time.

As someone who runs a community organisation I was lucky enough to attend an extensive Q&amp;A on the topic so we would be able to assess the impact of cuts on our activities. 

What *you've* clearly misunderstood is what I've initially said and the proportion of money returned to councils from central government.

Your hypothesis is that the money returned to councils from central government is equivalent to 25% of local council tax revenue multiplied by three - therefore council spending is equivalent to 100% of local CT revenue. It isn't. In 2013 the total returned to councils from government was almost £10 billion lower than the total CT revenue.

In any case the issue I was highlighting is that you don't, in the main, fund local services directly whereas most people think they do. Even taking into account the Policing precept, which, in the few places it applies, is an insignificant proportion of funding.

The current narrative around public services is the idea that some people haven't paid into the system, or haven't paid enough into the system to 'deserve' what they get back. The reality is that no one pays into the system - it is basically bankrupt - Osborne's problem during the last Parliament was that tax receipts are not growing because the new jobs in the economy are all at the bottom end. At the middle/top end we lost 50,000 jobs during July alone.

The average pension pot is £22,000 the average cost of elder care in my part of the country is £106,000 a year. So even if you fall into the 'worked all their lives' category you're still drawing far more from the system than you could have put in.

You're actually referring to 'Automatic train operation' and 'Automatic Train Protection' which is *semi-automatic control* which can work well when the physical line (platforms/path of track) and signalling are designed around the system. The London Underground of course isn't designed around such a system. ATO systems exist on the Victoria, Northern, Jubilee, and it's planned for the new Thameslink sections and Crossrail. Once the Subsurface upgrade I referred to earlier is completed, if it's completed, it'll be available on those lines too.

On the Central line implementation began in 1988 and took until 2001 to complete - 13 years. It required the replacement of all of the rolling stock and the entire signalling system. Tube stocks generally stay in operation for 30 or so years.

What ATO and ATP can't do is work out if the platform is clear or realise that a person has fallen under a train - only humans can do that. It also can't perform more complex operations like bringing the trains in and out of sidings and depots or deal with emergency situations. Large chunks of the lines require manual operation.

It missed mobile by a country mile - not just once but four times (Blackberry, then iOS, then Android, then tablet) - and refused to put its core software on the other platforms or integrate well with them which allowed a whole generation of users to realise that they didn't really need Office. More importantly startups embraced BYOD, didn't have a problem with mixed OS environments, and were turning to the LAMP stack or NoSQL and other GPL software on the back end - it was losing the future enterprise on both the desktop and the server.

Aussies have been arguing for 20 years that asylum seekers should be forced to go to the nearest UN High Commission for Refugees and apply there (because there is one in Jakarta and most of their boat people come through Indonesia), but that's not the convention in international law.

It is also arguably the case that abandoning any policy making role within the world's largest trade blocs and shoving all serious influence out of the door is the same thing as leaving the trade bloc. The belief is that these trade blocs need us more than we need them and that simply isn't true - both Norway and Switzerland know this to be true.

You also fail to mention the third popular option (and the one Farage is advocating) is extremist free trade - which does involve abandoning all trading blocs.

None of the [major economies we trade with](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/) sit outside of a trade bloc or free trade zone. None. Most of our exports and imports are inside the EU. Our largest single trade partner is the USA and our interface with it NAFTA is through the EU. 

Norway, often cited by Farage as an example of a successful free trading nation and a model he would like to pursue, [has said](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32957134) that we would be better off in the EU:

&gt;Norway was ""among the fastest in Europe"" in implementing EU directives, ""because the single market is so important"", with almost 80% of Norwegian exports going to the EU.

In short Norway does what the EU tells it to - exactly what the Eurosceptics say they don't want.

So, to describe what the Euro Sceptics are offering as a practical alternative or any kind of 'plan' or an increase in power or control is sheer lunacy. Farage and his cohorts would like to live in a different world economy than the one we have but have no real idea of how to get there other than running away from the partnerships we currently hold.

Worse, they basically want free trade for countries and businesses, but don't want a free labour market to match it.

- China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth.

- India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth.

- Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war.

- The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth. 

- Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale. 

- US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past.

1058,"I doubt it. 

Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous. 

Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.

The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.

This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.

Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.

So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.

They were forced to engage in the hard labour of constructing railways, roads, airfields, etc. to be used by the Japanese Armed Forces in the occupied areas.

Your new claim *'My original point, that wind companies, which generate electricity, are not competing with the part of the oil industry which generates gas is accurate.'* is **obviously bollocks** - of course they are fucking competing you moron, they both sell their product to the god damned generation industry - it's the gas producer's main business for the love of god, thats why the production/consumption trends reflect each other. Jesus!

The first paragraph of the report I linked to says this:-

&gt;UK Government has implemented massive subsidies to promote exploration and development of risky and unconventional oil and gas
in recent years, including deep-water offshore resources and
shale gas. 

Who the fuck does oil exploration - fucking Santa? - Oil companies.

Frankly what you've written is so ridiculous I couldn't be bothered to go point by point. However, since you invite it.

You've claimed.

&gt;Wind turbines are not competing with massive gas extraction.

Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.

&gt;The British Geological Survey reports that we've got shale gas reserves in the UK which would put us somewhere between number 3 and number 1 in the world for gas reserves.

Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.

&gt;That would give us a roughly equal amount of recoverable gas to Iraq's proven reserves

Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th. 

&gt;You're conflating electricity generation and primary energy production

No I'm not.

&gt;firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country

Yes. [We do](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74519000/jpg/_74519696_74519695.jpg). Around [£1.2 billion a year in fact](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9245.pdf) and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.

&gt;Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production.

Funny that it shows the same trends then.

I don't know why you think primary energy production backs up your case at all, what it actually [shows](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437455/Energy_Trends_June_2015.pdf) is a continuing downward trend in the production of gas since 2000 and a continuing increase in renewables as I suggested.

As for these *potential* sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting. The extraction costs are barely supported now let alone in the future given the unstable global market prices.

The BGS survey said:

&gt;""Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor.""

Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy. The paragraph above also suggests they don't have high confidence in their estimate of total reserve which was 822 TCF.

The overall funding gap (planned spending vs funding) is £30 billion (£6 billion per year) between now and 2020 and the NHS is expected to find £22 billion in 'savings' (i.e. cuts) to close that gap over the same period whilst moving to a 7 day a week staffing model and executing the Stevens Report modernisation programme.

Only way to do this is cut wages at all levels while increasing hours.

What Osborne announced was actually less than a third of the money the NHS needs to operate at current service levels whilst Hunt announced a massive increase in mandated staffing hours. Basically it will translate into a real terms cut because even the chancellor admits finding £22 billion in savings is 'challenging' at best.

1119,"'Apex Fallacy' is basically an example of trying to shift the argument and sow doubt, following in the well trodden footsteps of creationism, and as an argument is just about as ignorant as the idea that the Earth is 6000 years old.

MRASJWs would like to *assume* that the feminist concept of patriarchy relies on the idea that all men have the same power as those at the top of a given power structure. It doesn't. In feminist thinking a definition of patriarchy is this:-

&gt;Patriarchy is an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. 

Feminism isn't claiming that the men at the top of any given power structure have the same power as all men in that power structure - hence the fundamental idea behind the Apex Fallacy is complete bollocks.

Essentially what you're trying to claim by the use of the term is that feminism's concept of male privilege doesn't acknowledge the suffering of the poor downtrodden men at the bottom of a pyramid of power - who, as they see it, have no power or privilege, therefore there can be no such thing as male privilege or the patriarchy.

The fundamental argument as expressed by Dr. Helen Smith herself in an interview on the topic is this:-

&gt;The error in their thinking arises from a collective refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of male workers toil in the nether regions of our economy. These hordes of men-who make possible feminist lives of leisure-are totally invisible to the harridans who compare women, on aggregate, to the rich and famous alone. Indeed, when judging female progress, juxtaposition is only made with those males at the apex of our status hierarchy. It seems that feminists can discern none but the elite.

Her error in thinking is as obvious as her bias - she is arguing against what *she* sees as the feminist core argument, and her problem is that she doesn't understand that core argument in the slightest. She believes that feminists are elitists and consider only socially powerful men in their thinking and has constructed a nonsense argument against a concept of feminism that she has herself created.

Many diabetics of all types will tell you that their Diabetes was preceded by a serious viral infection - and there is a weight of scientific research that supports that view.

I wonder if your wholly ignorant attitude will change when Altzheimers Disease turns out to be [Type 3 Diabetes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/)?

The overwhelming majority of Diabetics are not, and never have been, overweight. Many Diabetics struggle with their weight after diagnosis because the two main drugs that treat T2, and insulin for T1/1.5's cause weight gain as a side effect.. 

While there is a correlation between [abdominal central obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity) and Diabetes, it isn't a causative link, and no other types of obesity are linked to the illness. We still don't fully understand the nature of the link just as we don't fully understand Diabetes or [Metabolic Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome). 

There are plenty of fat people who are not diabetic, even in old age, and plenty of thin people who become Diabetic so your hypothesis that Diabetes is the fault of the person, inferring that it is a disease of overeating, is simply false.

They would also be pressured by free market competition into providing stable and competitive pricing rather than price gouging - but of course the economies of scale to allow this to happen didn't exist in the market as it was privitised.

In fact what happened is that the privatised companies were conglomerated by large european utility companies into near monopolies and, as there was virtually no real money in the consumer energy market, all became vertically integrated (owning generation as well as supply). They were successful in their efforts to craft legislation that benefited them because as both the supplier and generator the government was utterly beholden to them for a functioning energy market, so there is essentially no competition.

Ultimately privatisation made the government accounts look good for a brief period and the public was instead bilked for more money from its own pocket book rather than the government's.

- UKIP say they want to *increase* defense spending to 2% of GDP, but our existing spending is 2.1% of GDP down from 2.4% in 2010. They also want to go back to 2010 troop levels and capability whilst replacing trident and spending around £400 million on a dedicated military hospital. Usual inconsistency from UKIP but this all adds up to a *huge* increase in defense oriented spending.

- Yes they do favor harsh restrictions on immigrants and their policy actually is a disincentive to the free-trade policy they advocate elsewhere. Read the manifesto and think through the effect of their policy. If, for example, a senior member of a US company wanted to move here they would be dragged through a points based system (this takes 12 - 18 months right now and costs £3 - £5k) and so would their family members wishing to join them - each family member would have to pass the same system as the policy is presently written.

- They want to leave the the world's largest free trade bloc (the EU) in order to make free-trade agreements with every other country independently. However there are only 25 countries globally not in trading blocs and our interfaces with those trading blocs are all through the EU. They advocate no other forms of international cooperation other than trade and specifically wish to favor the 'Anglosphere' when trading.

In short Kiptard's specialise in ignorant one dimensional thinking and wish you guys would read the big book political theories before vomiting your crap online.",2015-07-05 12:36:06+00:00,cssrv2y,8.0,t1_cssrg3s,1670.0,ukpolitics

They want huge increase in defence spending, their base favors harsh policing and criminal justice policies, harsh restrictions on immigrants and they anti-international co-operation on anything but trade and even then they'd like it all their own way - all authoritarian values.

1258,"I laughed out loud reading this, rarely has a Kipper managed to spout so much nonsense in one comment.

- Manufacturers want to sell one product to one set of regulations in as many places as possible, so much so that they often design around the cross regulation issues. You'll notice that many new cars have daytime running lights which allow them to be sold in scandinavian markets, and left/right headlight switches so the same vehicle can be sold in the UK and France with only software changes. Regulation codes are the single biggest problem businesses have and business spends tens of millions each year lobbying for changes.

- ONR is an operational safety body, it does not design or spec nuclear reactors and you, sir, are obviously an idiot to claim what you have here. Hinkley Point C, the first of eight UK sites, is presently being constructed. It's two *European* Pressurised Reactors are being built to a French Design which has become an EU standard by two French companies. EDF, one of those companies, will own the land and the plant along with the output (we are of course subsiding the build). This makes sense since they bought British Energy lock stock and barrel in 2009 and basically now own our entire nuclear industry. If we leave the EU this will prove highly problematic because their business runs to EU standards and is regulated by the EU, not us. Same situation in rail, water, fossil energy, parts of the oil industry, and Alliance Boots (our largest Pharmacy network) is also wholly European owned.

- I've worked for SWIFT, you simply don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about there. I assumes from the crap you've vomited that you simply read wiki. Iran isn't even the only country barred from the network.

- ISO manage the standards that US and now UK plugs are built to, because NEMA and BS have harmonised their standards through ISO. The UK is a voting member of ISO so we do actually have a role in the electrical and manufacturing standards US plugs are built to.

I see that you have become confused after claiming:

&gt;The current situation with the EU is the exception, leaving the EU would just put us in the same position we are with every other country.


And could not understand it when you were so obviously wrong. 

In fact almost all countries in the world are involved in some kind of economic integration or free trade area - there is even a handy  [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#Operating_agreements) showing how wrong you are. The list next to it shows many free trade areas, and our ability to trade in those areas is conducted through the EU. So leaving the EU wouldn't put the UK in the 'same position as every other country' as you claim, it would actually set us at odds with the overwhelming majority of other countries.

Many Tories and Kippers claimed during Indyref that Scotland couldn't possibly renegotiate all these agreements and would therefore be unable to trade across large parts of the world. The same applies to England.

Your UKIPCrapFu is obviously strong, having made personal attacks claim the other person started it and you show classic KipTard misdirection when wrong - shout louder, claim the opposition is stupid and hope nobody notices how wrong you are.

Seriously, there is a whole world out there if you would just educate yourself about how it operates.

Few if any would make it through the system he is proposing and each family member that wanted to join them would have to go through the same points based process. Its profoundly ludicrous and a profound disincentive to business.

The answer to your second question is 'How can you have free trade for businesses without a free labour market for people?' You can't. If a business is free to trade with another in the UK how can it do so when every member of its staff has to be dragged through the same months long process in order to complete a simple deal. They'll just go find a partner in a country with less restrictive policies - there are many to choose from. How could a manufactuer set up a UK base and bring over experienced staff to train new staff under those circumstances!

UKIP *is* proposing that the UK should stand alone. Farage's fantasy is that outside the EU the size of the UK economy will be attractive enough that we will be able to make trade deals with everyone. He stated exactly this in a recent EU speech on the African migrant crisis - he wants an end to all free trade blocs in order to allow everyone to trade together. He doesn't seem to understand that this didn't work the first time around.

So why would America waste their time on a trade deal with one country when you could access the EU with only one deal, and use that as leverage to access NAFTA?

The right wing justices voted with the Obama administration more this term than the left wing judges did, meaning the Obama administration won just 38% of its cases compared to an average between 60 - 70% per term for governments of all stripes. 

Scalia was in the majority in only 48 percent of this terms cases and Thomas in only 33 percent, which is historically low and very telling of the position of the court overall.

Also it wasn't just two issues on which the court leaned left - of course there was marriage equality, housing discrimination, Obamacare, and legislative districting but also a whole host of criminal justice issues that received much less attention (see link below).

It appears two forces are at work, the court has indeed leaned left this term, and the Obama administration has taken a much more authoritarian tack on criminal justice cases (but realistically everyone has a distorted view of the centre because both Republicans and Democrats are, by enacted policy, centre right parties).

What Farage, and apparently you, are seeking is deregulated trade markets with heavy personal border restrictions - two policies completely at odds with each other. Even Australia doesn't do this.

So you're happy to have your products regulated by the EU, and have companies regulated by the EU (which includes our entire nuclear industry, water industry, rail, energy, our largest pharmacy networks - all of which would be regulated by the EU because they're all owned by European companies), but have no control over that regulation? Really? I suppose that kind of illogic is what I should expect from Kippers.

We do have a means of regulating how banks in China and banks worldwide operate, its called SWIFT, it's based in Brussels and it controls and operates the network which connects all banks globally. Banks have to meet and observe certain standards to use it, and the EU regulates the trade of foreign owned banks operating within the EU.

We also have a voting role in regulating standards for American plugs through the International Standards Organisation incidentally.

The current situation is far from the exception. We are members of the World Trade Organisation via the EU, our interface with NAFTA is through the EU, as is our interface with the Asian Free Trade Area, Indian Free Trade Area, The Common Market For East and Southern Africa and dozens of others - EVERYONE is in a free trade area of some kind, as this handy [map shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free_trade_agreements#/media/File:Economic_integration_stages_(World).png)

A minute ago you were advocating free trade (Farage's vision is no restrictions on trade at all), but now 'every market must be regulated' - how inconsistent. Its not a false premise because one market feeds the other.

Incase you hadn't noticed the vehicle standards you refer to are the EuroEncap Standards - based on DfT research in the 80s - and its the EU that does the regulating. We would simply stick to those standards because we don't have a standards body (it wouldn't matter if we did), but we wouldn't have any say in what they were. Just as British vehicles sold overseas already obey those countries standards without involvement in the regulation.

Its the same with trade - we would be free to trade with whomever we wanted, so long as we obeyed their standards, but we would have no role at all in determining those standards. Norway, oft cited by Farage, says that it simply does what the EU asks (their trade minister laughed at Farage's comments and that's why our Nige stopped talking about them).

Getting over the idea that national economies work like household accounts would really help and might actually allow people to see the real problems.

Immigration and the increasing birth rate suggest that the scale of the problem has slowed dramatically since 2000 when we were on the edge of not replacing our existing population, but we need:-

- Better education and skills training of all kinds - this lifts incomes, it really is that simple.
- Free education - burdening kids helps no one.
- Ending child poverty - your childhood economic status determines your lifetime earnings. 
- Rethink pensions and the retirement age - the current rate of growth is simply not sustainable. 
- Employers *have* to pay a living wage - we can't continue to subsidise low paid workers in the way we have.
- Reduce housing costs - they have to come down drastically everywhere at every level.
- Immigration - we need as many working age adults as we can get.
- Employment inequalities exist - they must end for everyone, we need to increase the workforce.
- Incentivise having more children - we really do need more people.

There are groups that want to view marriage as a purely religious construct and therefore their rejection of LGBQT marriage or anything associated with it is a matter of personal freedom of choice and therefore protected - but that simply isn't the case and it hasn't been for a very long time because of the depth of legal status of marriage in national and international law. 

Attempting to limit access to marriage denies fundamental freedoms to LGBQT people - freedoms so fundamental that most people barely think of them or realise that they're even there until they don't have them.

Ultimately everyone is free to accept or reject LGBQT marriage in their personal lives, but they don't' have the right to impose their beliefs on other people in society and thereby limit other's freedoms for no good reason. 

Why wouldn't a baker, for example, that doesn't wish to service LGBQT couples simply put a sign in their shop window to that effect? This would save everyone embarrassment! The reason is that they know that such a sign would hurt their business even among the straight community - in other words they *know* that there is a difference between their personal beliefs and the functionality of their work.

On the company issue, I don't have a problem with your position and I don't think it's bigoted, but I do think it's unrealistic. Can we really live in a society where the personal religious views of a company's CEO affect *your* partner's ability to receive part of *your* pension should you die?

Survivor benefits could indeed be conveyed by contracts but there are a couple of big problems with that. Firstly it's within the discretion of the company - Apple will pay out, Hobby Lobby won't. Secondly when it comes to insurance its a matter of the legal term - legally they're only required to recognise the status of certain relationships and without a change in the law that doesn't happen because it would increase costs - this leads to LGBQT people paying more for certain kinds of insurance and having to have specially drawn up wills etcetera.

Care workers, oil rig workers, IT workers and the like are all part of the modern working class can, and have, realised benefits by moving overseas where they are better paid or gain better quality of life - but the reality is that if you're on an hourly waged shift work job in a factory in Northampton freedom of movement is only going to put your wages under pressure.

- It actually *lost* vote share in four target seats based on its 2010 and 2014 performances: South Basildon and East Thurrock -4.43%, Croydon Central -24.45%, Rochester &amp; Strood -11.6%, Clacton -15.3%

In other words Farage isn't nearly as good of a campaigner as people think, and the major UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler (who paid for the campaign) was correct when he described the election as ""a failure"". This is the reason why there was a leadership coup following Farage's un-resignation.",2015-06-17 20:37:32+00:00,cs9ynep,2.0,t1_cs9wcmg,3539.0,ukpolitics
1406,"It doesn't need Farage to polarize it and looking at a list of UKIP donors the party is basically paid for by *The Establishment**. 

Just look at yesterday's shenanigans in the House of Commons. Basically the Eurosceptics can't even agree on the rules amongst themselves let alone with anyone else. We have two years of this nonsense to look forward to and the public are already exhausted by the clap trap spewing forth over the issue.

* UKIPs main donors 2001 - 2013 (total, of which less than two million came from other sources, £9,554,314): Paul Sykes, Stuart Wheeler, Julian Blackwell, Sir John Craven, Lord Neidpath, Viscount Michael Cowdray, Lady Yvonne Vinson, Lady Yvonne Collin, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Clare Barbour, John Malcolm Richards, Christopher Mills, Robin Birley, Crispin Odey, and Andy Brough.

The man is a former Express journalist and the party's communications director - he knew *exactly* what he was doing. The quotes were given in a deliberate interview which included similar attacks from a number of senior UKIP members.

Attempting to suggest that UKIP's GE Campaign Director, MEP, and Director of Communications, a former journalist has no relationship, or hasn't previously been supportive of the party leader is simply ludicrous. ",2015-06-16 08:21:08+00:00,cs867bo,23.0,t1_cs7p9wp,35482.0,ukpolitics
