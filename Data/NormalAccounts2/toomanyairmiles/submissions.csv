Some of the bounces are generated by emails to other users inside the business, others are from messages sent to external addresses. Some emails go through one minute and not the next. All the email addresses concerned are valid and other users within the company have no problem sending to these addresses.

Each bounce message displays the email address of the recipient as a html link - the text part of the link displays correctly user@domain.com but the mailto address underlying the link is MJCEAEX-R@EX22062.lan or some variation.

The diagnostic information returned includes the following:-
Generating server: S22062.EX11062.lan
MJCEAEX-R@EX22062.lan
Remote Server returned '550 5.1.1 RESOLVER.ADR.ExRecipNotFound; not found'

The number of bounces has slowed somewhat over time, but we're now three months from the migration and bounces continue at three to four per day.

We've done the following:-

 - Added an autodiscover record to the domain
 - Deleted the user's local machine profile and recreated it from scratch (more than once).
 - Rebuilt the user's machine from scratch
 - Tried a wide variety of local machine settings changes recommended by MS
 - Prevented Outlook from caching any email locally
 - Updated every email address in the user's address book to ensure they were in the correct format.
 - Repeatedly deleted the local machine autocomplete cache.

At this point we, the ISP and Microsoft Support are completely mystified but the problem is causing significant issues for the user. 

Any help or ideas appreciated.

The Government is committed to delivering seven day services to make sure that patients get the same high quality, safe care on a Saturday and Sunday as they do on a week day.

Many people do not realise that if you are admitted to hospital on a weekend, you have a 16% greater chance of dying. The Government wants to change this so that everyone can be confident that they will receive the same level of care whatever day of the week they are admitted to an NHS hospital. 

NHS consultants already provide an outstanding service and show great dedication to ensuring patients get the best outcomes. But the Government has a duty to make sure the system is set up in a way which makes it as easy as possible for hospitals to organise their resources to maximise patient safety across every day of the week.

To understand more about the possible issues for staff contracts, last year the government asked the independent pay review bodies for NHS staff - The Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration (DDRB) and the NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) for their observations and recommendations about how the reform of employment contracts could help support the delivery of seven day services in England.

The reports were published this month. They identified that a major barrier to seven day services is a decade old contractual right in the consultants’ contract negotiated by their union representatives in 2003 that allows senior doctors to refuse to work non-emergency work in the evenings, at nights and at weekends. No junior doctor, nurse or other clinical group has any such right. Other senior public sector professionals who work in services required to keep the public safe, such as police officers, firemen and prison governors, do not have this opt out either.

Whilst the vast majority of consultants work tirelessly for their patients, the opt out allows individuals to charge employers hugely expensive payments which are much higher than national contract rates (up to £200 an hour). The average earnings for a hospital consultant are already in the top 2% in the country at £118,000, and these inflated payments can make it difficult for hospitals to provide the weekend cover they know patients need. 

The report endorsed the removal of the opt out, as well as broadly supporting other changes to the consultant contract that would ensure the right level of cover is available every day of the week; not just Monday to Friday.

Under the new plans, doctors will still continue to receive a significantly higher rate for working unsocial hours and there will be a contractual limit (not an expectation) of working a maximum of 13 weekends a year.

By the end of the Parliament, the Government hopes that the majority of consultants, in line with existing practice for nurses, midwives and junior doctors, will be on reformed contracts, working across seven days, to deliver a better service to patients. Hospitals like Salford Royal and Northumbria that have instituted seven day services have already seen improvements in patient care and staff morale.

These new plans will mean that doctors working in some of the toughest areas in the NHS, such as A&amp;E and obstetrics, will at last be properly rewarded and there will be faster pay progression for all consultants early on in their career. Under the new proposals, the highest performing consultants could be able to receive up to £30,000 a year in bonus payments, on top of their base salary.

Of course, improving weekend care requires more than just ensuring greater consultant presence. That's why the government is also addressing issues such as access to weekend diagnostic services, provision of out of hospital care to facilitate weekend discharges, and adequate staffing cover amongst other clinical groups,. But NHS leaders and the independent pay review bodies are clear that increasing the presence of senior clinical decision makers at weekends is vital, and that the consultant opt out remains a barrier to organising broader support services and staff rotas.

The Government feels it is under an obligation to the public to do all it can to make NHS care at the weekend as safe as during the week through the delivery of seven day services this Parliament and that is what it will continue to do.

Because this is how I feel about our policy positions and thus far I'm unconvinced by any of the leadership candidates. Their campaign's seem to be more focussed on party factionalism than any uniting vision for the party much less the country.

Thursday 9 July
There will be no Tube service all day. Extra bus and river services will run. Other public transport and roads will be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours. Please travel outside the peak times if you can. 

Friday 10 July
There may be some disruption during the morning as services resume. 

Staff on the bus network, the DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles are not on strike. There is separate strike action by the RMT on First Great Western services from Thursday 9 July for 48-hours. As always, we advise you to check with your train operator or national rail enquiries.
