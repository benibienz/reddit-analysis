1,"One thing is clear: there are some old photos of Cagots online, and one can see that the inbreeding was definitely taking its toll. Yowza.

Here's something: the wiki article says that some people described them as blonde, whereas others described them as dark. All the photos of Cagot that I can find are of short, dark people. There is one woman in France who admits that she is a Cagot; she is short and dark-haired and says her whole family is. She believes that the Cagot are descendants of Moorish invaders, possibly interbred with Basques (and they do resemble Basques somewhat, imo.) 

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html

ETA: ok, I'm down the rabbit hole on this one. Some people theorize that the Cagot were descendants of the Bagaudae, a group of peasants who revolted against the Roman Empire, in areas today part of Spain and France. This would actually make sense in terms of restricted professions, and the etymology makes sense too.

While it seems that Casey was the more aggressive abuser, Sandy was not an innocent bystander. He's just as guilty. He abused her physically, he covered for Casey, he stood by while this kid was murdered, he profited from her death. 

Even if Casey was the one who struck the final blow (and we don't know if she was,) the years of abuse contributed to her death. Sandy is just as culpable in her murder. He abused her and he supported Casey's abuse of Erica. Sandy was supposed to be Erica's *father*.

15 weeks is not a long time to build tolerance with tret. For comparison, I started using .025% once a week, buffered by using a light moisturizer beforehand. (I also used moisturizer afterward.) I did that for about 3 months. Then I moved up to using it twice a week. I was not able to ever use the .025% more than twice a week, it was too irritating every time I tried.

I switched to a Curology formula that was .017% tret and continued using that twice a week, altogether I was at twice/week for about 8-9 months. I only recently began using my tret 3x/week, and I'm coming up on a year of tret.

54,"A few things:

How old are you? I don't think people without severe acne should start tret until they want to use it for anti-aging- and you can use other actives to help prevent aging for a long time. Unless you really *need* tret (severe acne, other actives have not worked, etc) you are right to think that you didn't need it. 

.05% is a pretty high dose to start with. It's generally recommended that you start with the lowest dose possible, which is usually .025%, and use that only once a week. Then slowly work your way up to using it more often, before you even think about raising the dose.

The problem with your ""explanation"" is that this is not what happened. Not even remotely.

Here is what did happen: 

Dan called Rachel from the jail.  Rachel told him that his brother, Tim, had mentioned to her that he had some evidence pertaining to the murder. 

Dan begs her not to tell police about the evidence. She tells him she is absolutely going to tell the police. He tells her ""If you do that, I'm doomed."" 

At this point, Dan had still been denying that he killed Juri and Sam. When he learned that Rachel was *not* going to cover for him, he confessed to police that he did it because he was ""crazy"" and said his reasons were ""money and insanity,"" but mainly money. 

Dan also told Rachel that he had ""done a terrible thing"" and was going to confess and that she would ""never see him again.""

Ok, comments like this show that you really don't understand how trials work. Your complaints about the trial and the lawyer seem based not on facts but about your mistaken ideas about how things should work (like your belief that using jailhouse informants is illegal, and your belief that lawsuits make it illegal.) Your opinions about the case are based not on facts but on your misunderstandings, and that's why they are not valid. 

That is the kind of testimony that happens during sentencing, not during the guilt phase of the trial. This kind of testimony is not a defense for murder, and would not be used in Dan's defense. 

Your complaint upthread was that the lawyer didn't ""defend"" Dan until the sentencing phase; the kind of testimony you suggest should have happened is inappropriate for any area other than the sentencing phase.

You're also assuming that there were witnesses to attest to this. If there *had* been people to testify that Dan was a good guy, they would have been on the stand.

64,"&gt;revealing that could provide some credibility to the theory that he was initially helping Daniel with bank fraud . . . .I'm not sure I believe that theory myself, but I wanted to present the evidence for it anyway.

What evidence for it? You didn't actually present any, probably because there is none. The fact that Sam Herr was *charged* with murder once (and was acquitted, so technically he was innocent under the law) is not ""evidence"" that he was involved in bank fraud. It isn't evidence of anything, and that's why it wasn't a part of his trial. 

&gt; He wasn't behind financially by very much

THIS is actually a misconception, which appears to have originated in the blog by Dan's ""friend"". Dan was overdrawn on all his bank accounts and just a few weeks before the murders, he was more than one month behind on rent. The landlord had started eviction proceedings, but had stopped them when Dan agreed to come up with the money. The problem was that he *didn't have it*. Dan's friend the blogger admits all this but then says Dan wasn't ""very much"" behind.

Maybe to you and to Dan's friend this is not ""very much"". To adults who don't have money falling out of their butts, being several thousand dollars in the hole is *a lot*. (Average rent in Costa Mesa is more than $2k, so even being only one month behind is a LOT of money.)  And when you are overdrawn at most banks, fees accrue daily, so every day you owe more and more. This is also the case with many apartment leases- every day the rent is late, you owe more and more. 

&gt;his lawyer didnt say much either

Lawyers do not testify. They give an opening statement, they give a closing statement, they question witnesses. 

&gt;His defense was nearly nonexistet.

That's because *what he did was not defensible*. I don't know why that's so hard for you to understand, tbh. Dan initially tried to claim that he was insane and committed the murders due to mental illness. He actually said to police ""I'm crazy and I did it.""

When his stupid attempt at an insanity defense didn't work, he was out of options. He had admitted the crimes, there was a LOT of direct evidence against him. I really don't understand why he didn't try to plea bargain, but that was probably because of his persistent ego. ",2016-10-25 20:04:28+00:00,d97hsko,3.0,t1_d97epb6,3829.0,UnresolvedMysteries

75,"&gt;I meant no physical evidence (such as DNA or fingerprints). Everything used to convict Daniel was circumstancial, and same witj Rachel going to trial.

This is just not true. Most of the evidence used to convict Daniel was *direct evidence*, not circumstantial evidence. 

Daniel confessed to the murders. He knew the methods of both murders before police did, and he told police where to find Sam's body parts. Direct evidence, not circumstantial.

He had Sam's debit card and gave it to a teenager, asking that kid to make withdrawals. Direct evidence, not circumstantial.

He had the murder weapon and a backpack with Sam's bloody clothes, which he gave to his brother. Direct evidence, not circumstantial.

Now, in Rachel's case, there is ONLY circumstantial evidence against her and imo it's very very thin. 

&gt;WHY would he be advised against it?

Why would Dan be advised against testifying? A couple of reasons: one, because his own testimony makes him look bad. He already confessed. He has never recanted his confession. He is guilty. He says now that he was under great mental strain and on drugs, and that this makes him not guilty, but come on. No jury is going to like that. 

Two, because if he got on the stand to testify, the prosecution would have cross-examined him and dragged out every ugly aspect of his personality and the murders, in front of the jury. This would not have looked good for Wozniak. 

Wozniak's lawyer had a bad situation: he had a guilty client who committed a brutal murder, who was egotistical and self-centered, and who claimed he wasn't responsible because he was on drugs and stressed out. He was not a sympathetic perpetrator. The best Wozniak's lawyer could hope for was to avoid the death penalty; there was no advantage, in terms of avoiding the death penalty, in putting Wozniak on the stand.",2016-10-25 19:06:34+00:00,d97ezyi,3.0,t1_d97ccz8,3172.0,UnresolvedMysteries

Your understanding of that case is flawed. It is not illegal to use jailhouse informants or to offer them reduced sentences. There was a problem, in this same jurisdiction, with the way information from jailhouse informants was used (such as the DA not disclosing evidence that would indicate innocence.) Some previous cases were retried based on this problem. 

Wozniak's case was investigated to this end and no misconduct was found. This is actually why his trial was delayed for so long, because his attorney tried to tie it to the other informant cases, so a very thorough investigation was done. 

It's very normal for defendants to not testify, a defense attorney typically chooses this when the defendant's testimony will only implicate them and not help them. ",2016-10-25 18:38:55+00:00,d97dm5p,3.0,t1_d96slly,36069.0,UnresolvedMysteries

85,"First of all: Dan Wozniak was not a ""theatre kid"". He was a grown-ass man. There was ample evidence against him: he knew details of the crime before police even knew them (knew Juli had been shot in the head twice, before the ME's report gave police this information); he dismembered Sam Herr and scattered his body parts, he had Sam's debit card, and he had a backpack with Sam's bloody clothes in it (which he gave to his brother, along with the murder weapon.)

Second of all: Sam Herr's past is totally irrelevant to his murder. That's why none of it was presented at trial, because it had no bearing on the crime committed by Dan Wozniak. Most people are not perfect innocents, so most murder victims are therefore not perfect innocents. Sam Herr had a violent past, that does not in any way excuse Dan Wozniak's murder of Sam and Juli.

I don't see any evidence that Rachel was involved at all. The police/prosecution are so, so reaching on this by charging her. I feel really sorry for her, in fact. 

Their only ""evidence"" against her: she repeated something Daniel told her when the police asked them questions; she told a theatre colleague that her friend (Julie) was missing and that her neighbor was a suspect, and she cried on stage. None of these are indicators of guilt! There is literally ZERO actual evidence against Rachel. 

The state also fed the media claims that Rachel was in on it because she supposedly wanted the money for a big wedding. Rachel's parents, though, say they were already footing the bill for the wedding. 

Daniel, on a recorded jailhouse phone call, *confessed to Rachel* that he was involved in Julie's death. Rachel immediately said ""I'm telling the police."" She cooperated completely with police, she did not cover for him AT ALL, but she's being treated like a criminal. It seems to me that Rachel trusted Daniel and he used that trust to manipulate her. 

Daniel is obviously very narcissistic and entitled. He thought he was too smart to get caught. He sent text messages to Juli from Sam's phone, he gave Sam's debit card to a teenager using some BS story to manipulate that kid. He even *called an old high school friend and asked him to lie to police to alibi him for the murders*. He gave his brother the murder weapon and clothes with Sam's blood on them. Like a lot of criminals, he was convinced that he was a total mastermind, while he made stupid choices that would lead right back to him. 

He was behind on everything financially and hiding that fact from everyone, including Rachel. 

Your post is the first time I've read or heard that Wozniak's brother helped him dismember Sam and scatter his body parts. What's your source for that? AFAIK Tim was not involved in the dismemberment, but did help Daniel hide evidence.

86,"&gt; the face shapes in the examples I posted before are really accurate

Because these are examples being shown to the public. Where are the examples that didn't look like the subject, at all? WHy doesn't this occur to you? 

This method cannot take into account epigenetic/environmental factors. Face shape, for example, is largely mediated by diet during developmental years. Children who grow up eating fibrous whole foods tend to have wider jaws and wider dental arches than children who grow up eating softer, more processed foods. This affects the shape of the lower face, the shape of the cheekbones, and the shape of the nose.

Hair color is also epigenetic, sometimes in ways we don't understand. For example children who start out with one hair color, and change to another one as they get older. Redheads can turn blonde or brunette, blondes can turn brunette, etc. Then of course there is hair dye. 

Eye color and skin shade can change from childhood to adulthood as well, and be altered cosmetically.

106,"I don't actually see any evidence to suggest that BDSM was involved in this death. So it's kind of funny to me that there are so many comments suggesting a BDSM scene gone wrong.

I also don't think that the way that the three witnesses behaved was really that unusual or suspicious- people do tend to shower in the evening, not everyone reacts the same way to traumatic events, and if he was clearly already dead, applying pressure to the wound would not be helpful.

WRT the ""cleanup""of the scene, that is suspicious. It's entirely possible that one of these three murdered Wone. But it's also possible that something they or Wone would find *embarrassing* happened and the cleanup was an attempt to cover it up. Wouldn't it be nuts if Wone died accidentally or unexpectedly during consensual adventures, and these three cleaned the scene to try to spare him embarrassment?

So the possibilities I see are:

- Wone was engaged in consensual sex with one of the three residents, and another one killed him out of jealousy. The others covered for him out of fear or loyalty.
- Wone was killed by one of the residents for another reason and the others covered for him out of fear or loyalty.
- Wone consensually did drugs or got high with one or more of the residents, and there was an accident. The three residents panicked and staged a murder to hide the gay sex or drug use element. 


You would be surprised how many ""straight"" men have sex with other men, but still identify as straight. In fact in medicine we call them ""men who have sex with men"" aka ""MSMs"" because they get offended if we call them ""gay"". 

I think that the fact that three gay men were living together in a relationship caused the police and prosecution to do a LOT of sensationalizing in this case- their imaginations ran away with them. I don't see any proof that BDSM was involved, for example, and the police just *decided* that Wone had been drugged, although they found no drugs on his tox screen. 

It's not remotely unusual for gay men to have sex toys or porn in the house, so even bringing that up in court is really sensationalizing.

There's really no need to raise the concentration if you are doing well and getting good results from .025. Raising the concentration usually just results in more irritation, for not much more effect. You're already having bad irritation, why would you want more?

But none of that is the case with the Ruffs. They were very open about *why* they went through her things.

331,"No, it doesn't.

First: depression is a mood disorder (not a mental illness), and it is very very common. About 7% of adults in the US have been diagnosed with depression, and those numbers are climbing. Most people with depression are functional and have normal lives.

Suicidal ideation is also very very common. Yet most people who think of suicide, or who even plan it, don't go through with it. The main thing that stops them is that they think that it would hurt the people who care about them. Lori became convinced that no one remained who cared about her: she had made her marriage and child the center of her world, and her husband had left her, her in-laws were trying to take her child away, and I am sure she knew that in her state of depression, she wasn't taking the best care of her daughter. 

Suicide most often happens when life stresses *exceed the coping abilities* of people with mental health problems (and no, before you say it: ""mental health problem"" does not equal ""mental illness"": mental health problems include mood disorders, learning disabilities, behavioral disorders, personality disorders, developmental disorders, substance abuse, and mental illnesses.) 

According to the experts who study suicide (and I'm not one of them) suicide is *not* evidence of ""serious mental illness"". But claims, like yours, that it is contribute to the stigma attached to suicidal impulses, and that stigma prevents people from getting help to prevent suicide. So when you say that suicide is evidence of serious mental illness, you are actually *hurting people who need help* and increasing suicide numbers.

&gt;If a loved one commits suicide, your first question is, ""why?"" 

Lori was not her in-laws' loved one. They did not like her, they interfered in her marriage, they slagged on her at every opportunity.

&gt;she left some letters to the family when she died, but, again according to wikipedia, those consisted mostly of ""incoherent ramblings"".

That's actually according to her in-laws, who didn't like her because she didn't want to talk about her childhood and she didn't *stay in the kitchen with the other women.*

At the time Lori died, they had no idea she was using an assumed identity. All they knew is that she didn't want to talk about her past, and that she said she had had an unhappy childhood. 

But her BIL said:

&gt;he was sent to “scrub that house down to see if we can find out who in the heck she was.”

They were not being considerate, they were not going through her belongings for her daughter's sake, they were not just cleaning up, they were not doing anything at all because she was a ""loved one"". They wanted, very specifically, to invade her privacy because she was a private person and they didn't like that. They were very clear about their intentions, and they were not about ""thing to remember her by"".

Not really. At the time Lori would have been stripping (in Texas at least, I can't attest to the laws in other states), strippers worked entirely on contract, and there was basically no paperwork on anyone. You had to show an ID showing you were 18 to start working, but after that, no paper on anything, you were paid only in cash tips from customers. 

It was a very portable job, and often your coworkers didn't even know your real name. (Strippers used fake names for work, and everyone at work called you by your work name.)

Her marriage and child were everything she had worked for, and with her marriage gone, she felt like she had nothing to live for anymore, and that's terribly sad.

Her cousin says the problems started when her mom remarried, but blames it on Lori and her supposed failure to adjust to the divorce. If the divorce was the problem, the problems would have started *before* her mom remarried. This is classic victim-blaming and it happens a LOT in families of abusers. Lori told her mom she was cutting contact, so I am sure she also told her mom *why*. This is very common among abusive parents- they will say they have *no idea* why their children hate them or want no contact. 

Just reading between the lines, I suspect that her stepdad was abusive, her mom was an enabler who blamed Lori, and Lori decided she wanted nothing more to do with these people. It's possible that what the stepdad did was so terrible that Lori felt she had to change her name to protect herself.

Ok, I see you aren't really very familiar with thylacines or their history. At least 4 thylacines were filmed in captivity. 

This film shows an adult and two juvenile thylacines. I think you will see that a lot of the beliefs expressed on this thread are incorrect, such as the idea that thylacines hold their tails only straight and don't move them. I also think that the ""hop"" you think indicates that the mystery animal is a thylacine is just what happens when an animal is lame in one foot and weak in another leg. I see no hopping from the actual thylacines. 

ETA in this film you can see the single male thylacine's body shape very well, it makes obvious the differences between him and the mangy fox filmed in 2008: http://www.naturalworlds.org/thylacine/captivity/films/flv/film_5.htm

Tret will not make your face thinner, or make it look thinner. It has no bearing on the fat beneath your skin, or the muscle structure of your face.

If you feel like your skin is becoming dry and lined, the question for me is: how much are you moisturizing? Tret is very drying and imo it requires deep hydration and moisture. If you are not using a moisturizer with ceramides, I suggest adding one. Your skin can be oily but still dehydrated. 

Are you using any other actives besides tret? I find that without a chemical exfoliant, my skin does get dull, adding a mild BHA or AHA might be helpful. 

And on top of that, aging happens. Even to people on tret. The lines you see emerging may just be normal aging for you.

Pedophiles are people who are exclusively sexually attracted to prepubescent children. 

Child molesters are people who sexually abuse children. This is a violent crime. 

Most child molesters are men who identify as heterosexual, and who have satisfying sexual relationships with women. (In fact Ken Parnell, who kidnapped and raped Steven Stayner, had satisfying sexual relationships with women both before and during Steven's captivity; he even had children with them.) 

We really don't know a lot about how many pedophiles exist, because the stigma against pedophilia keeps them from coming forward. But we do know that there are many pedophiles who feel terrible about their attraction, who believe that acting on that attraction would be heinous, and who spend their lives resisting their urges. They should be commended but unfortunately they have little to no support. ",2016-09-04 17:50:19+00:00,d79b9ba,12.0,t1_d791ywm,17479.0,UnresolvedMysteries

586,"It does not sound to me like you are being used. It sounds to me like you have kid of snobby, unrealistic expectations for your wife, and that you are looking for excuses to end your marriage, but you want to blame your wife instead of taking responsibility.

Soapbox moment: in the USA, we are taught that everyone is supposed to find something they find fulfilling and make that their *career*. This is mostly bullshit. A career is a luxury, something only available to the middle class and above. Poor people, working class people, usually don't have careers, they have *jobs*. 

Your wife's mom had a job. Your wife has had jobs. There is not a single damn thing wrong with having a job, even a low-paying one. It is totally normal for people who work retail to change jobs often- that is the nature of retail. 

You knew going into this marriage that your wife was limited in education. You knew that she had poor reading and math skills. Yet you fault her for those things, as though they are her fault or something she has done wrong.

I went to community college, a decade after high school. When I started, they tested me to see my math level and said I qualified for college algebra. So I registered for that class and on day 1 I knew I was way over my head. I immediately dropped the class and moved into whatever the preparatory class was. If I had done what the college recommended, I would have failed that class and possibly believed I was unable to succeed in college. That's probably what happened to your wife.

The way you describe your wife, it sounds as though she has a learning disability. What she needed to succeed in college was remedial classes and extra support. 

You say you have been working full-time ever since you finished grad school, and that while you were in grad school, your wife worked full-time. So what I am getting is that she largely supported you through grad school, and now you're ready to dump her because she doesn't have the same earning power that you have. That's terrible, and honestly, it seems like *you* are the user, not your wife.

It's very troubling that you refer to your wife's health insurance, personal items, cell phone, etc, as ""her expenses"". You two are married. Those are mutual expenses. Those are the expenses of your household. Your way of thinking frames these expenses as hers alone, so you can say she's not contributing to the household. But when she pays those expenses, she *is* contributing.

Your claim that it's hard to buy a home when your wife is working minimum wage is also just a smokescreen. It's completely untrue. Since you two are a married couple, any mortgage application would be based on your combined income. So, it would actually be easier for you to get a mortgage with your wife than without her. (Most of my family works in real estate, so I know of what I speak here.)

So far, you haven't actually shown that your wife has done anything wrong. You are just complaining that she has a lower earning capacity than you do. Welcome to reality, this is a thing that happens. If you want to end your marriage, take some responsibility for your 7-year-itch instead of blaming your wife for things outside her control.

That isn't how evolution works. 

As you said, in terms of evolution, the years after reproduction ends are less crucial to genetic investment. So, what happens *after* fertility ends does not affect which genes are passed on to offspring. 

What that means is that although over-exposure is harmful, the harm does not prevent reproduction. So, it doesn't matter, in terms of reproductive success. It does not mean that the sun is overall beneficial, it just means that the harm does not prevent successful reproduction. If there is a genetic vulnerability, it cannot be selected against, because the problem doesn't kill people before they reproduce.",2016-09-01 08:12:18+00:00,d755fi1,4.0,t1_d754xj3,1750.0,SkincareAddiction

I've seen nothing to indicate that the island *actually* floats. The satellite imagery looks to me like rising and falling water levels, and vegetation changes over time.

Yeah! And as a parent, you don't have to *give him a chance* to ""do something"" before you get to say ""I am protecting my kids from this man."" Your instinct as a parent is to look out for *possible* dangers- you don't let your kids run in the street until they get hit by a car, you keep them *out* of the street so that they won't get hit at all. Same with your stepdad: you keep your kids away so nothing *can* happen, instead of waiting until something *does* happen. You don't owe any of these people overnight visits just because they want them.

One of the most chilling things I've ever seen was when a coworker's husband was acting really handsy with her teen daughters. A friend urged her to leave him and she snapped ""He hasn't done anything to her yet!""

Like she had to wait until he actually raped her daughter, before she could stop him. Like that was a rule! It was just the most bizarre non-logic ever.

If, at some point in the future, she actually asks you why you don't send the kids to visit for weeks at a time, you can calmly say ""Mom, because of Harold's behavior toward me when I was a teenager, I am not comfortable letting the children be with him unsupervised.""

618,"&gt; Do you believe being predetermined genetically to have any sexual preferences is impossible

Ok before I answer I should define some terms. 

Sexual orientation= your attraction or lack thereof

sexual preferences = the activities you like to do during sex.

The very idea of a sexual orientation is a new one. It didn't exist until the 20th century. Before that, there were only sexual *behaviors*. In fact sexual orientation is largely a western idea that has been spreading. 200 years ago, there were no ""gay"" people, there were instead people who engaged in homosexual behavior. In most of the world, still, people are just people and sometimes they have sex with other people of the same sex, sometimes they have sex with other people of the opposite sex.

There is lots of evidence that genetics are involved in homosexuality among men. The best clue we have is a study that showed that the sisters of gay men have higher fertility (more children) than do women who do not have a gay brother. This suggests that there is a gene or combination of genes which predisposes a person to *have more sex with men*, and in women this gene is an evolutionary advantage because she has more kids. In this model, homosexual behavior in her brother is a neutral ""side effect"". 

We also have identical twin studies, which show us that homosexuality is *not* ""predetermined genetically"". Identical twins are genetically identical, they are born with all the same DNA. Yet identical twins do not always share the same sexual orientation. This indicates that there is an environmental factor. 

Although it's politically favorable these days for gay people to say that they were born queer, that has not always been the case. I'm a queer person in my 40s and in the 80s and 90s when queer studies were very new, a lot of queer people identified as queer by choice. IIRC, a study in the late 90s found that about 80% of lesbians (surveyed) identified lesbianism as a choice that they made, whereas only about 10% of gay men identified gayness as a choice. 

There was also a really interesting phenomenon in the 90s, some small studies found that some trans men, who had identified as lesbians before transition, came to identify as *gay men* after transition. This indicates that their orientation was wired toward *attraction to the same gender*, not attraction to a particular gender. 

So I think that our genes absolutely have an impact on our sexual orientation (who we find attractive) but that this attraction is *not* predetermined, only influenced by our genes. 

&gt;I ask of course because i would call that 'genetic sexual attraction'

Ok, that would be grammatically incorrect, but also not relevant to the current use of ""genetic sexual attraction."" ""Genetic sexual attraction"" is a term invented by a woman who was attracted to her son. She claimed (and she calls it a ""theory"", but in scientific terms it is *not* a theory) that people who are separated from close biological relatives during childhood are predisposed to find those relatives irresistibly sexually attractive if they encounter those relatives in adulthood. There is zero evidence that this predisposition exists, but many incest proponents have seized the term to try to justify their incest (because close incest is not socially acceptable in the west.)",2016-08-31 19:46:14+00:00,d74fidc,5.0,t1_d73dqw2,68300.0,relationships

644,"Because I am not an idiot, I think it really depends on the medication and how it was tested. Typically, when a medication is tested on animals, it is because the disease in question has a similar course or mechanism in that animal, as it does to humans. Even so, about 40% of all drugs which pass animal trials are withdrawn from clinical trials because of adverse effects that didn't show up in the animal trials. In those cases, the animal trials *were* meaningless. (If you're actually interested in this subject, here's a kind of synopsis of info: http://www.livescience.com/46147-animal-data-unreliable-for-humans.html)

""Comedogenic"" has a specific meaning, which is that a product will clog pores *by causing follicular hyperkeratosis.* Shaving a rabbit's skin irritates the skin, and we know that irritation causes hyperkeratosis as well. Rabbits are much more prone to hyperkeratosis than humans, and they also develop it *faster*. That's why, in my opinion and many others, saying that an ingredient is ""comedogenic"" is meaningless. 

In the case of humans, whether or not an ingredient will clog your pores has a lot to do with your skin chemistry, and can be affected by what other ingredients you are using on your skin. So just declaring that an ingredient is comedogenic is really meaningless. 

http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/myths/_/five-bogus-cosmetic-claims

It's also meaningless because different sources will give you a different claim about whether or not an ingredient is comedogenic.

Just FWIW, I have never been a victim of incest. My view on incest and sex in general is that anything consenting adults do of their own free will, which does not harm anyone, is their business and should be permitted. However, I do not believe that parent/child incest can ever be truly consensual, because of the inherent power imbalance that exists in the parent/child relationship.

Why not? I was very clear what I have against the term. It is pseudo-scientific claptrap invented by a woman who was trying to legitimize her attraction to her son. She is not a scientist or a doctor, she literally just *made this up* so she could try to convince people that her desires were healthy and normal. 

&gt;Your insistence that this is not real, or completely abnormal, is not

Please point out where I said that your attraction to your siblings is ""not real"". The fact is that I never said that. What I said is that ""GSA"" is not a real thing (it's not) and that looking up resources on GSA will not be helpful to the OP, especially since his sister is *not ""genetically"" related to him*.

I don't understand why it should be hurtful to *you* that I call out the people who want to make incest between parents and kids socially acceptable. Why does that bother you? If you aren't one of those people, what's the problem?",2016-08-30 21:14:48+00:00,d734xuf,7.0,t1_d734rfb,237.0,relationships
664,"If you really want to help her, the thing to do is this: tell her that you hate to see her in pain, and ask what you can do to help her. Ask if there is something you can do to help her to have a better life, or to help her to manage her own treatment better. And then *listen* to what she tells you, and really do it. Don't say she is wrong, don't say you know better. She knows best what she's going through right now.

Let me tell you, most people with a 15 month old daughter are exhausted, ok? Toddlers are exhausting. On top of that your GF is dealing with a debilitating illness, she is in pain all the time, and pain is exhausting. 

She takes a lot of smoke breaks because nicotine is a stimulant and it makes her feel less tired. It gives her a little more energy to go on with her day. She drinks sometimes because when you are in pain all damn day, when you're exhausted and worn down, this little scrap of pleasure that you get from having a drink is enormously valuable. 

The same with food: food is not just fuel, it's a social thing and it's a pleasure thing. When you are in pain and tired, the pleasure you get from eating something you enjoy is important, because it's *all you've got*. Also, as a chronically ill person, I can say that having a healthy diet is a lot of work, and when you're having a bad exacerbation, it falls off the radar because it becomes too hard. Dealing with a toddler on top of that, I can't imagine how she does anything at all. And on top of that she has someone blaming her for her illness and pushing her to do more than she can do, pushing her to do things that hurt her, etc, and this guy is the parent of her child and she really, really needs him to be supportive, but instead he's killing her motivation with his constant pushing.

You might think that you are subtle, that you have hidden the contempt for her that leaks through your every post, but I am sure she can see and feel it. 

Since you say you like doing the cooking, how about working to make a wider variety of delicious foods that fit within her guidelines? That would be genuinely helpful. You say she gets tired of the things you cook and eats what you consider ""junk food"". If she's getting tired of the things you cook, that indicates that you cook the same things over and over, or that the food is bland. Change that up. 

The number one thing you can do is *stop blaming her for her illness*. She is not to blame. She did not make it happen. It is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases are *worsened* by stress, so what you are doing is actually *making her sicker*. You need to sit down and realize that you are *not an expert* on what she is experiencing. You are convinced of your expertise and have decided that if she did what *you* want, she would be better. But your conviction is misplaced.

If you want your GF to exercise more, you should make room in her life for exercise. If she's too exhausted from her day to take a mild walk, then she's not going to do that and haranguing her won't help. Instead, how about investing in some childcare or a maid so that she can gain some energy, and then go for a walk as a family?  

I think that a more supportive environment will help your wife to deal with her illness in a more positive way. Right now you're all-negative, all the time. 

I do think it's reasonable for you to want her to quit smoking. Smoking is bad for her, for your daughter, and it makes RA worse. So talking to her seriously about the smoking is something direct that you can do. But you need to frame it in terms of ""This is a thing that is bad for your health and for our daughter, I would like you to stop."" Keep in mind that nicotine is highly addictive and quitting is HARD. ",2016-08-30 21:10:55+00:00,d734rj9,3.0,t1_d730wgm,4979.0,relationships

She claims that people who are related to each other are likely to be attracted to each other ""because genetics."" She is not a scientist, a psychologist, or a doctor. She just *made this up* to try to defend her desire to have sex with her son.

2- there is absolutely no proof that siblings who do not grow up together have an ""increased chance"" of incestuous attraction as an adult, compared to the general population. None. This is something that incest apologist say to defend their actions. 

What you are thinking of is the Westermarck Effect. It is ""a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction.""

Your mom is likely to escalate, so it's important that you talk to her school and any other caregivers, to make clear that she is not allowed to have contact with your daughter.

Your daughter, at 5, is old enough to understand the concept of a time out. So you might tell her that grandma behaved badly and is in time out right now. You could also tell her that grandma is sick, the kind of sick that changes how people act, and so she cannot be around Leah until she gets well and acts nice again. But it might be a long time before Leah asks about your mom again; kids can be very ""out of sight, out of mind"" and they also pick up on tension and being picked on.

When I was a kid, my mom constantly harassed me about my weight, much like your mom did. My mom didn't teach me healthy eating habits (she mostly fed me junk, and rewarded good behavior with sweets) but she constantly harassed me about being ""fat"" and ""out of shape"". As a result I spent my childhood and young adulthood convinced that I was fat, when I really wasn't fat at all. As a young woman I had a 24"" waist, weighed 115 pounds, but I thought I was fat and gross! My mom really warped my sense of what a normal body should look like, and of what *I* looked like, because of her constant harassment and weight-related abuse. 

Like your mom, my mom even lied to try to lend authority to her abuse. She told me that my dance teacher had taken her aside and said that I was getting ""too heavy"" and needed to lose some weight. I felt so, so awful about that, and it turned out that my dance teacher had said no such thing.

My mother kept harping on my weight and size until I was in my early 20s, at which point I told her ""I am not interested in your opinion on my weight or any aspect of my appearance. I did not ask for your input, so shut the fuck up."" That felt really good :) 

My endocrinologist told me that young people, especially women, who are abused this way are actually *more* likely to become obese as adults than are women who are allowed to just grow and be kids. He said that this kind of abuse makes women unable to make good food choices (because every choice involves anxiety) and it also makes them likely to eat too little, and then binge when their blood sugar gets low. This see-saw of blood sugar eventually causes insulin resistance, and *that* leads to obesity. Then obesity makes people *more* insulin-resistant- at that point it's a self-perpetuating cycle that becomes hard to break out of. So, your mom's abuse may have had long-term consequences for you, and you saved your daughter from that same fate.

&gt;If this is in fact BG, and the isotope analysis is correct, this would make sense, as she had been spending the last years of her life in the Texas area and probably was living a harder lifestyle that brought out her freckles and a ruddier complexion. 

What is the basis for this belief? The comment says that Patricia went missing 9 years before Buckskin Girl was found, so how would anyone know that BG or Patricia had ""been spending the last years of her life in the Texas area"" or ""living a harder lifestyle""? Salamandyk grew up on a dairy farm, which was very hard work.

BG was very clean and well-groomed. She displayed no evidence of ""living a hard lifestyle"". Her clothing, including her underwear, had a lot of soot on them, indicating that she had spent a lot of time in a NE industrial area (those places used to be covered in soot and smog.)

His entire intention in this relationship was to convince you that he was one way (rich, generous, loving) so that he could get you to marry him. Now he has shown you that he is not rich, generous, or loving; he is parsimonious, abusive, and dishonest.

Before you were married, your husband paid for dates. Now that you are married, he expects you to not only pay half of dates, but also pay half of all expenses, even though you are pregnant, unemployed, and working for his family's business. He is literally letting you and your unborn child go hungry. 

Please think about this rationally, for one second: if your husband were actually wealthy, he would not be getting groceries and money from his parents. If he were actually supporting his family, he would be giving groceries and money to *them*. **Your husband is lying to you and he has always lied to you**. He is not a millionaire. He is not even self-supporting. That business that you think he owns, probably belongs to his parents, and the work you are doing for that business is almost certainly the job *he* is supposed to be doing. They probably think he *is* the one doing it.

I suspect not, since you keep emphasizing that these friends are women. If it's ok to do with a male friend, it's ok to do with a female friend. 

Where I think your BF erred was that he had a date with you, and he invited a friend over and basically ignored you all evening. That is not ok. But it's fairly typical- I see it as thoughtless, but low on the scale of problems. My BF is a really great guy, but there have been a few occasions when he has invited a friend over to ""hang out with us"" and they end up geeking out on whatever they are jointly into but I'm not, and I get ignored. Typically I speak up and say ""It's rude to have a conversation I can't participate in,"" and then the next time that person is coming over I will just excuse myself and do something else.

I also think he erred in ""refusing to talk to you"" but I have to wonder *why* he was doing it. Was he giving you a silent treatment to punish you, or did he need time to himself because he was hurt and upset, or did he just withdraw because he was feeling really sad and confused?

If Marble is alive, he is now a legal adult and there would be no legal repercussions if he were to ""reappear"". 

The Charley Project says he had been in care since 9th grade. So at the time of his disappearance, he had been in foster care for 3-4 years. It also says he was still close to his first foster mom, so his move from one placement to the other was probably not a matter of bad behavior on his part.

It's unlikely that he ""vanished to start a new life"" because he was a senior in high school and was looking forward to his *actual* new life, aka going to college. Foster wards in the US are guaranteed a college education paid for by the state, he knew this and was looking forward to it.

750,"I think the evidence suggests that Ross killed the child, the aunt may or may not be involved. Especially when you consider the text message about leaving the kid somewhere. 

I think Ross didn't want the kid around, he took matters into his own hands and killed him, and Jennifer is either too stupid or too scared to roll on him. Women do really dumb shit, WRT men, when they are pregnant. 

I do think it's sketchy for the media to compare their reactions to those of actual parents and say things like ""They aren't looking for their son,"" etc. Hassani was not their son. He was Jennifer's nephew, and while I know that if my nephew was missing I would move heaven and earth, not everyone feels that way I guess. 

But my point is that foster parent is not the same thing as parent and expecting them to act like parents or feel like parents is just wrong. 

Before anyone jumps in with a rude comment: I am an adult who grew up in foster care and I am also an advocate for kids in foster care. So I am familiar with the system. Yes, some foster parents are good people, but the idea that foster parents are all wonderful people who love children is a myth.

&gt; She also emphatically denied to the psychiatrists who evaluated her that she had been abused, either sexually, physically, emotionally at home. 

Just as a note: this is not at all unusual for abuse victims. When I was a kid, I bragged to other children that ""my mom NEVER spanks me!"" when in fact my mother was *beating* me really severely. 

When the principal at my school asked me if my mom was hurting me, I clammed right up and insisted that no one was hurting me at home. 

When my sister's school counselor asked her if our mom was hurting her, she also clammed up and insisted that nothing was happening. 

Because abuse victims are trained to think that the abuse happens because something is wrong with *them*, and to protect the family/abuser at all costs, they will frequently deny that they have been abused. Abusers convince victims that they, the abuser, are all that the victim has, and if they are arrested or embarrassed or etc, the victim will have nothing.

761,"You say that you regret pressuring your parents, but have you ever told them that? Have you ever apologized to them?

I think the solution is twofold: one, you need to sit down with your parents and tell them how deeply you regret pressuring them to be BFFs with your in-laws. Tell them you know it was wrong and you are very sorry. And tell them that it means a lot for them to be at your daughter's first birthday party.

The second thing is this: your husband needs to handle his parents. It sounds like your ILs were very pushy and rude to your parents, and you just kind of blow that off and think it's ok. It's not ok. I suspect that for every incident you know about, there is at least one other incident you don't know about because your parents didn't tell you. Your husband needs to keep his parents in check and set some boundaries. His mother insulted your mother, made your mother cry, and you two apparently did nothing about that? You didn't apologize to your mom or say anything to your MIL or to your husband about his mom? You showed your mom that you don't care if your MIL is mean to her. 

Your wedding should have been YOUR wedding, about YOU. The fact that your ILs made it about THEM and tried to force your parents to participate in that is a giant red flag. These people have poor boundaries, and your mom doesn't feel like being pushed around, insulted, walked on, etc. That's perfectly reasonable.

762,"Dick is not a nice person, and I have a real problem with how your friends, including your boyfriend, are enabling him. 

I've heard misogynist guys trot out that old ""men don't like short hair"" thing before. What is happening is that these men are self-centered, so they think that their preferences are universal. They don't like short hair, ergo, they believe NO men like short hair on women. 

I have had really long hair and I've had really short hair. I've had a mohawk and a buzz cut and a shaved head and let me tell you, people (men and women) went NUTS over the mohawk and the buzz cut. My BF in particular LOVED the mohawk and thought it was super-sexy. 

Ok but all that is really beside the point; it does not matter what ""men like"" or ""people like"". What matters is that this is YOUR body and YOU like your hair. What matters is that Dick is being rude and your BF is both backing him up and missing the point. The point is not whether or not Dick might be ""right"" about what men like. The point is that your body, your hair, your appearance, etc, are **none of Dick's business** and **his behavior is rude**.

I suspect that Dick has the hots for you- that's why he keeps telling you his opinion about your hair. He wants you to care about his opinion. He wants you to feel insecure and worried and do what will make Dick like you. Don't do it. 

You have options, the next time Dick starts in:

Dick says ""Men like women with long hair,"" you can say ""Women like men with manners."" 

You can say ""You're assuming that your opinions are universal, they aren't. Ever since I cut my hair, I get hit on all the time!""

You can look puzzled and say ""Why are you telling me this, Dick? What do your preferences in a girlfriend have to do with me?"" and let him sputter. 

You can say ""I didn't ask for your opinion, Dick. Let me make this clear: I do not care what you, or your imaginary friends, think of me, my hair, or any aspect of my appearance. Your constant comments and insults are rude and bullying. Shut the fuck up.""

An important thing is that you don't have to tolerate this. YOU are not the one making things weird or awkward- Dick is doing that. So if you want, talk back, and let it be weird. 

It's possible that everyone else in the friend group is feeling uncomfortable, and if you start talking back hard, they will join in. It might help to talk privately with some other people in your social group. I think you should also talk to your friend, Dick's GF, and tell her ""Dick has been making unwelcome comments about my appearance. He is bullying me and escalating, so he is not welcome at my house or at events that I plan. You're still my friend and you are invited, just don't bring Dick."" 

Your BF needs to be your ally here- he is just standing by while someone bullies you, and he's trying to undermine you in private. You need to talk to him first and make it clear that *what men like* is not the issue and does not matter: the issue is that Dick is bullying you and issuing unwelcome opinions on your appearance.

Your wife did not marry you looking for a Drill Sergeant. She did not sign up for that treatment.

Stop being such a jerk to her. Why is that not obvious?

Nowhere in your post do you say that you love your wife or talk about any of her positive qualities. It's just describing how she used to look vs how she looks now. No gratitude for what she went through to give you a child, no thoought to how SHE feels about her looks or her health. Indeed, you don't even seem very concerned about her health, your main focus is how she looks. 

News flash: your wife knows how she looks. She knows what you think. She knows what impact it may have on her health. **She does not need you to tell her** and your continued harping on it is bullying. You are only making her feel worse about herself, which makes her much less likely to work out or eat well or take care of herself in any way.

The precolombian people of Peru were extremely sophisticated people. They had very large trade networks and travel was not at all uncommon. 

They also had extremely hierarchical systems of government. I'm oversimplifying here, but essentially the king was responsible for the well-being of the people, so he had to be a diplomat, smart ruler, scientist, and religious leader. If the king said ""Draw this image in the desert,"" they did it. 

Orcas were considered avatars of a god. The image of the orca is all over the art of ancient and precolombian Peru (pottery, textiles, sculpture). So even someone who had not been to the ocean and seen an orca would know what an orca was and be familiar with the image.

There were actually a lot of secret Jews in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. (They are called crypto-Jews.) After the Inquisition, Jewish people in Spain and Portugal were forced to convert to Christianity, or be killed. So many of them converted but continued to secretly practice Judaism. 

Over time some families lost knowledge of their Judaism. So you have many Catholic families in, for example, Mexico, where women light candles on a Friday night but they don't know why- it's just because ""my abuelita did it this way.""

It doesn't matter if you think it's harmless when *you* do the hitting. What matters is that your boyfriend told you not to do it. HE wants you to stop hitting him. Why don't you?

I think that's totally reasonable, as well. (But OP is a man.) 

&gt;maybe bro is a deadbeat who's housing situation hasn't changed since he moved into his sister's flat

Did you actually read the post? I mean, the post is clear about OP's gender, and it also says that the brother was in the process of building his own home, and that OP kicked him out. So, clearly not a deadbeat, nor is he still living in the flat.

This situation is, imo, weird. OP called it ""his"" apartment, but legally it belonged to his mom, and that was HIS choice. He was perfectly happy to let his mom shoulder the tax burden and responsibility for the apartment, but not to let her have any control over the apartment. He didn't want to take that responsibility himself, but he wanted control over the apartment. That right there is messed up.

I think that if it were really OP's apartment, OP's parents and brother did wrong. But it was OP's mom's apartment too, and in that case she also had the right to make decisions about it. 

OP wanted and expected help from his parents in terms of securing this flat, working on it, and caring for it. But he resents his parents for helping brother to procure a home for brother and his family, and he clearly feels very judgey about the brother's spending. 

And on top of that, OP escalated the situation and keeps exaggerating. He says over and over that his brother and parents ""stole"" from him. They stole nothing. OP's posts demonstrate some highly narcissistic traits, and that's one reason I am suspicious here. OP thinks his parent and brother are all bad and all wrong, and that he is all good and all right.

She got breast implants when she was working as a stripper, AFTER she took on the LEK identity. Not only would she have easily been able to afford them with only a few weeks worth of work, but they would have qualified as a tax write-off because they are a business expense. 

Working as a stripper would also have given her the opportunity to save money to pay for a new ID, so I am guessing she did stripping before she became LER as well. 

&gt; I assume pre-1988 transition to her new identity as Lori

For example, my vet has been my vet for a really long time and I have followed him from practice to practice. So he (of his own volition, I never asked for this) gives me a 10% discount on services. Not on products, though, because he would lose money doing that. I'm grateful as hell for the discount he has given me.

I suffered a lot of abuse because I maintained that relationship in order to keep in contact with the kids. 

You know what? We are all adults now and those kids don't give a shit. My parent still managed to poison them against me. As they got older, they distanced themselves from me, because the parent told them I wasn't really family. 

One of them is a meth addict who only calls me when she wants something. Another one is a stereotypical bro who thinks our parent can do no wrong (even though he was abused too.) And another one is just identical to the parent- mean, abusive, shitty, narcissistic. 

I wish I had known now that it wouldn't even matter to them. I stayed in contact because I wanted to do whatever I could to protect them- the meth head is still angry that I didn't protect them *enough* (even though I tried really hard, but meth head lied to counselors.) They use me, steal from me, and abuse me emotionally. It feels like all those years of trying were wasted.

Katie can only save herself. She can try to be in contact with the kids as they get older, like through social media or relatives. And in the UK, the courts do sometimes grant visitation to extended family. But Katie should not make herself sick by being in contact with her parents. There are no guarantees.

You've only been together 6 months. That time frame makes it totally reasonable for her to keep her actual, specific income to herself. It also makes it reasonable for her to split dates with you 50/50. She's looking for a partner, not a sugar baby or a leech. 

Your GF sounds like a kind and generous person who cares about her friends. Her BFF helped her avoid homelessness when she had no one else. Your GF is now in a position to help her friend and she has chosen to do to. 

Your GF sounds like a thoughtful, caring person and it's probably shocking to her as to why you are acting so bizarre about something that affects you not at all. If I were her, I would see this as a red flag and keep an eye out for more.

1154,"I find this mystery in particular fascinating. I really wish that we knew more about the man who had the murder weapon- he is almost certainly the murderer, and maybe he or someone around him would know their identity. Websleuths quotes a newspaper as saying his name was ""Lonnie George Henry"". He lied about where he got the gun, saying he bought it from a truck driver, but it turned out that it was a gift from his brother and he, Henry, had filed off the serial numbers. 

Supposedly Henry had an alibi for the time of the murder, but its sketchy imo. He owned the murder weapon for 4-5 years before the Does were killed. It seems certain that he killed them, but we won't know why or who they were because he's dead. 

I think we should put aside the claim that Jock's father was a well-known, wealthy doctor. I think it's probable that if this were true, he would have been identified already. So either he made that up while shooting pool, or the witness misremembered or made it up himself. Also, the witness claimed that Jock said his family ""practically disowned"" him for not becoming a doctor, which many on the internet have expanded to ""his family disowned him for giving up his medical career.""

The Does apparently had similar skin color and before DNA testing ruled it out, police theorized that they were siblings. Since they aren't siblings, we don't even need to assume that they both came from the same place originally. In the 70s, travel was much cheaper than it is today, and young people pretty routinely traveled all around.

So while the Does were found together, they aren't necessarily from the same place. They could have met while traveling and decided to stay together. Has anyone checked them against missing people from different areas/countries?

Jock Doe bears a very strong resemblance to a missing Metis man from Canada, Edward Joseph Arcand. I don't think Jock Doe is Arcand, but it got me to thinking that Jock Doe might have been a member of a First Nation. Unfortunately, LE in Canada has a very very bad record in terms of handling missing or murdered indigenous people. 

It seems to me that once again, LE bungled this case very badly. They never followed up on the KOA witness, so they lost the opportunity to look at the campsite logs, for example. ",2016-08-07 21:51:34+00:00,d689gnb,1.0,t3_4wmhc7,6013.0,UnresolvedMysteries

You're right, I misunderstood that part of your post.

&gt;You think they're going to chase after her and tackle her in the street? 

No, of course not. In fact in most foster charters, they are not allowed to stop a teen ward from leaving in any way. They are supposed to immediately call the police. In one placement I was in, the police were called if a ward even stepped outside the fence without permission. 

Your last paragraph makes zero sense. You said in your other post that if they had hurt Lindsey, the RCMP would know about it. My response was highlighting the absurdity of that assumption. ""If a crime could have been committed, the RCMP would know!"" is a stupid thing to say/believe.

I don't have a bias against foster parents, what I have is a realistic view of them, which contradicts the mainstream view of foster parents as saintlike people who devote their lives to helping children. *You* are the one bringing your biases into this conversation, and prioritizing them over facts and relevant experiences.

Kids don't get put into foster care because someone is ""struggling for money"". Removing a child from their home is an extreme step, especially if the kid is white.

Yes, there is. The fact that they ""let"" her hitchhike to another town, did not report her missing right away, etc. These are all very suspicious.

I mean, there are so many holes in the official story: the break-in was supposedly based on a rumor that the Goldman's had saved up $10k in cash, to smuggle Danny to Canada. But this was the day before his 18th birthday. Surely, if they were actually going to smuggle him to Canada, they would do it *before* his 18th, and anyone seeking that money would know that, and would have broken in weeks beforehand. 

It's also hard for me to believe that in 1966 it cost $10k to get from Florida to Canada. 

The Charley Project says that Cacciatore's photo was in the newspaper several times after the kidnapping, and the Goldmans never recognized him as the man who kidnapped Danny.

A fragment of a rubber glove, made and distributed only in Canada, was supposedly left behind by the kidnapper. Also, Aaron Goldman said that the kidnapper had a ""midwestern"" accent- was Cacciatore from the midwest?

1250,"&gt;them saying ""you're just embarrassed by your parents! you don't like us! etc, etc""

This is a pretty classic manipulation tactic; it's supposed to simultaneously derail the conversation (while you defend yourself and say it's not true) AND make you feel guilty. 

So here's an idea: you say to your parents ""I'm not comfortable with you posting about me so much on social media. I've asked you several times to stop posting about my personal life. If you can't stop posting, I am going to have to stop telling you what's going on in my life.""

""But you don't love us!""

""I'm sorry you feel that way. But, I need you to stop posting about my private life on social media.""

""You're just embarrassed by us!""

""I'm embarrassed by your frequent posts sharing my private information, so I am asking you to stop.""

You know, and *they* know, that whatever things they say to guilt you are unreasonable and untrue. So you don't need to argue with them. Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain.) Just set your boundary and keep it.

If they keep posting about you on social media, then it's time for an information diet. They can't post what they don't know. So, stop telling them about your daily activities, pending decisions, etc. If they ask for this information, you can act like they didn't ask, you can change the subject, you can even say ""I'm not giving you personal information anymore, remember?"" 

Remember: you aren't really hurting their feelings, even if they say you are. You are setting a boundary about *your life*, and if they are upset, it is because they aren't getting what they want, not because they are hurt. Also remember that they have no hesitation about hurting *your* feelings in this matter.

I disagree. Her story doesn't hold up under scrutiny, and her posts are entirely about her feelings, needs, desires, and disappointments. She describes her daughter's significant speech delay as ""stubbornness."" That is not reasonable or thoughtful, it's actually incredibly ignorant and hateful. 

She says that the police just automatically believe teens over adults, which is not true. 
She says that the police believe she assaulted her daughter, but they did not arrest her. 
She says that she has no resources, yet admits that CPS has offered her resources for counseling. 
If she can afford to pay for this camp, she can afford to pay for actual therapy for her daughter. 
She says that Kim is able to fool every mental health practitioner she has ever visited into thinking she is fine.
She says that Kim gets no benefit from therapy, so she won't get therapy for Kim , but says she's sending her to this camp because they have therapy.",2016-08-03 17:06:43+00:00,d62p2ot,7.0,t1_d625s4s,39132.0,relationships

I don't think that a highly manipulative teen could fool a mental health professional the way you think they could. At a single-session ""screening"", a professional may not be able to come to a diagnosis, but they can tell that something is wrong. 

WRT a long-term therapeutic relationship, you are correct that this is the ideal. OP, on the other hand, has been giving her daughter single-session ""screenings"", then saying that her daughter has ""fooled"" the professionals.

In general, this is not true. If police believed that you were assaulting your daughter, they would arrest you. The fact that instead CPS has offered you resources means that they do not think you are assaulting her. 

&gt;therapy with her is like talking to a wall.

Then why do you think it will be any different at this camp, where, you say, there are lots of therapy sessions? If you really think therapy will help her, you wouldn't need to send her to camp.

I understand that you need a break. But sending her to this ""camp"" is almost certainly a bad idea. For example, they talk about restraining her; this is actually very very dangerous.

You are not responsible for your mom's troubled marriage. You are certainly not responsible for their marital problems (which obviously started before you were even born) nor are you the one who has to or even CAN save their marriage.

The fact that your mom's husband even said this to you, that he told you that YOU are the one who should fix their marriage, just proves that he is a total piece of shit. Because that is such a manipulative, hurtful lie.

These people had 5 years to be parents to you, and they weren't. They are treating you like an object- they don't want you, but they don't want anyone else to have you either, and they don't want you to be happy without them. 

Your grandmother betrayed your trust and she owes you a big apology. You probably won't ever get one, and you get to decide if you are ok with that. You care for her and up until now she's been good-ish to you. But your former mom and her husband- you owe those people NOTHING and you are not responsible for their problems.

I suspect that this is NOT out of nowhere. OP's spouse has been telling him calmly and nicely for months that she needed him to step up, and instead he's doing even less and making things even harder for her. So now she's angry, and with good reason. 

The post reminds me a lot of how people with PDs think. GF says ""OP, I need you to do more around the house because things are hard right now."" OP says ""What do YOU do around the house?"" and when GF says ""Here is a list of the things I do,"" OP interprets that as ""GF goes on and on about how AMAZING she is because she does things.""

OP also imagines that when his GF asks him where an item that he put away is located, she's doing it to mess with him. This is a paranoid fantasy. When she asks him questions she knows the answer to, she is doing it to try to get HIM to understand the answer, not because there is some sinister plot involved.

&gt;She says “she’s disappointed” since I don’t care about her and our son and I tell her I do but that doesn’t matter since I didn’t call or stay in touch

She's right, OP, it doesn't matter. What you say means nothing at all without action. Your actions tell your GF over and over that you don't care. You abandoned your kid for days at a time and you think your GF is wrong to think that you don't care?

OP, you still seem to think that you shouldn't have to do any work in the care of your son or your home. This is nuts. You aren't working outside the home, your GF IS working outside the home, therefore it makes sense that you should take on the majority of childcare and housework while you look for a job. The idea that because you are going to move out eventually, you shouldn't have to do anything around the house, is insane. It really is. You live there now. Your son lives there now. 

OP's GF is NOT handling this well. Name-calling, telling him he is worthless (if she really is doing that) etc- none of these are ok. But she's clearly extremely stressed. She has a baby and a coparent who won't coparent, who just makes more work for her and is full of excuses. I think it would be better for both of them to split up, because OP's GF wouldn't have to deal with him anymore and he wouldn't have to hear her insults anymore. 

I don't think the name-calling is right, but I understand how the GF got to this point. She's been asking OP to get it together for years now and he won't. His whole post is one excuse after another. ",2016-07-31 19:44:35+00:00,d5ynyxn,2.0,t1_d5xn8n1,77076.0,relationships

I am in agreement with you and to be honest, it is very troubling that your wife is not. Your wife is 30 and a parent, yet she is acting like a child here. If she encourages your son to call her ""mommy"", then she should act like she's his mom, and that includes treating the children fairly. 

What she is proposing indicates that she doesn't really love your son. She's been pretending to do so in order to get what she wanted from you, presumably marriage and a child. She's willing to hurt your son over, and over, and over, to what, prove some kind of point? That is not loving. 

I hope you two will get some marriage counseling, and can get on the same page. If she continues on this path, things are going to be terrible for your children. Yes, both of them.

&gt;It's hard to imagine how a six year old's severed head would end up dumped in a canal if he hadn't been murdered 

This is true! But it's never logical to assume that dead body or even severed head = murder. People do weird shit to cover up accidental deaths or death by neglect. The head that was identified as Adam's was, according to the ME, dead before the head was severed. The head had also been gnawed by animals. 

There is absolutely a possibility that the child was murdered but was not Adam Walsh. /u/sophies_wish is, fallaciously, assuming that there are not many children murdered in Florida.  Florida, in particular, is TERRIBLE in terms of caring for or overseeing care of children who become wards of the state. Kids just disappear there and no one knows what happens to their bodies. Florida has a history of telling families that children ran away when in fact they were murdered by the people who are supposed to be caring for them. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_School_for_Boys (Before some uninformed argument-addict jumps in and points out that this school is afar from there the head was found, I am offering this merely as an example of the state's known activities, not to suggest that the head came from this school.) 

I am not saying that this child was not Adam Walsh. I'm saying I am not convinced that he was, and that an argument based on a belief that there are not going to be many dead, unidentified, unreported children out there is not a rational argument, especially since we're talking about 1981.",2016-07-29 18:53:33+00:00,d5w8x3u,8.0,t1_d5u70ns,124263.0,UnresolvedMysteries

It is absolutely the norm. Women talk about this  all the time- about how men start out with verbal harassment and then escalate to further violence or threats of violence. There are many many discussions about this online.

""Catcallers"" *are already violent* because verbal harassment is violence. It is designed to scare women. That's the point of it. The men who verbally harass women are doing it in order to make themselves feel powerful and make their victims feel helpless. Calling it ""catcalling"" is a way of minimizing this behavior and its impact. 

Male cats ""call"" for female cats. They are looking for mates. Men who verbally harass women are not looking for mates, they are engaging in violence against women.

How has your BF neglected the dog?

- leaving her home without him all day
- not training her. Seriously, this is part of being a dog owner.
- not bathing her often enough (this is why she smells. It is her skin condition. She needs more baths, probably medicated ones.)
- not giving her enough attention.

The dogs behavior is typical of an intelligent dog who is bored and neglected. Setters are very intelligent, high-energy dogs. They are not dogs for people who are gone long hours. 

Your BF is being passive-aggressive. He just dumps the responsibility for the dog onto you and when you point out that the dog has problems, he makes the comments about a nanny. I notice that he also expects that YOU will help pay for the cost of a dogsitter.

If you marry this man, this is what your future looks like. He will ignore and neglect any children you have.

Here is the first red flag: your mom wasn't texting your wife, daily, to ask how she was doing *before* the pregnancy. The implication is that now your wife is pregnant and your mom suddenly cares how your wife is doing every day. But, she didn't care before. How do you think that makes your wife feel? It makes her feel as though she is not valued for herself, but for her pregnancy. 

Second red flag: you told your mom to back off. She backed off temporarily and went right back to the bad behavior. Instead of acknowledging that your mom was deliberately crossing the boundary you and your wife had set with her, *you blamed your wife* and threw her under the bus in the worst way.

&gt;I talked to my mom again and told her that my wife was having mood swings.

Seriously. You did this. You undermined your wife, you implied that her desire for boundaries is emotionally unstable. When it was *your mom* who did wrong here. This is terrible husbanding. 

So, your mom goes on to violate the boundaries your wife has asked for, *yet again*. Your wife is frustrated. Your mom is walking all over her and YOU refuse to enforce boundaries with YOUR mother. 

&gt;I tried explaining it by saying that my mom means no harm and is just trying to be caring.

So, your wife told you that this situation, your mother's ongoing objectification, lack of respect, and boundary violation, was unbearable for her. You responded by making excuses for your mom.

- It *does not matter* if your mom ""means no harm"". She is still *harming your wife* emotionally. Plus, she is showing complete disregard for your wife's wishes and consent. 
- If your mom was really ""trying to be caring"" she would do as your wife has asked. Your wife wants NO MORE daily texts. Your mom is still sending daily texts. 
- your mom is telling both of you that she doesn't care what you or your wife want, she only cares about what she, your mom, wants. 

&gt;Is this behavior due to being pregnancy

No, this behavior is due to *your mother being disrespectful and childish*, and due to *you being disrespectful and undermining toward your wife*. As well as too cowardly to set a firm boundary with your mom.

It is really disturbing to me that you are constantly making excuses for your mom and trying to blame your wife for this situation, when it's your mom who is out of line here. I bet it's upsetting to your wife, too, and that is why she is thinking about divorce. She is imagining the next 20 years of her life with your mom ignoring her boundaries and violating her consent and privacy, and she doesn't want to live that way. 

You need to apologize profusely to your wife, tell your mom firmly to *stop the daily texting* and respect your boundaries, and get on your wife's side here, right away. ",2016-07-26 20:52:35+00:00,d5s0ixh,1.0,t3_4uqt9c,922.0,relationships

I think that before the wedding, you and Michael need to see a marital counselor to talk about this. You two need to be on the same page WRT giving money to his siblings and tolerating their abuse. 

Michael himself needs to lay down a hard line: insults and abuse will no longer be tolerated. It's amazing to me that these people think he should give money to people who insult him and his wife!

And next time they come demanding money (which they will surely do) he should say ""I don't give money to people who insult me and my wife.""

If they don't come to your wedding, yay! Why spend even a cent to feed and entertain these two. Their comments about you are just projection- they are the ones who are gold diggers here. Ignore them on social media, vent to your friends about what is going on and enjoy support from them.

There's no reason to think that she hoarded copies of the book and gave them out to people (and in any case, the book had been out of print for some time. It would have been very very very difficult for her to even *have* more than one copy of the book.) When Jessica was initially interviewed by police, she was asked if she had ever given anyone a copy of the book. She said yes, she had given a copy to one person, Alf Boxall. 

So, at first the police assumed that SM must be Alf Boxall. BUt when she saw the bust, she said that wasn't Boxall (and it wasn't.) 

For some reason people have become fixated on the book and assume that Jessica gave it to SM, because she gave a copy to Boxall. In reality, her giving a copy to Boxall isn't any reason to think that she gave one to SM. The book might be irrelevant to finding out his identity.",2016-07-24 03:49:52+00:00,d5oduab,,t1_d5odkbt,563.0,UnresolvedMysteries

That, to me, says that something happened that made him want the afternoon off. He called in to establish a reason to not be working for the rest of the afternoon. This also means that he expected to come back and be fine- he wanted his job to be waiting for him the next day.

So, something sudden comes up, he wants the afternoon off. No sight of him leaving. He doesn't come home until midnight. The next morning he goes to work, taking a different bag than usual. Never seen again. Cell phone pings elsewhere the day after *that*.

I'm not leaning toward voluntary disappearance, because he called in to work. Otherwise I would suspect that. 

If I were police I would be looking at any cell phone calls, instant messages, texts, etc, that came in shortly before he called in to work. 

ETA: I learned more about this case after making this post. Foco was seen at a bank around 8pm Tuesday. He was seen on the ATM camera, and then entering the bank a few minutes later. SO he used the ATM and then went into the bank. Did he need more cash than the ATM's daily limit?

He was home at 10pm, when he went from his apt to his car to get something, and back to the apt. He was next seen entering the garage at 12:07am. Not seen leaving.

""I'm making this post to clear up some misunderstandings that have been brought to my attention. My condo in Malibu costs very little to maintain when it is empty. But when someone is in the condo, the costs go up. That means that when someone not myself is staying in the condo, IT COSTS ME MONEY. In those cases I am paying extra for something I am not using. 

I've tried letting people stay in the condo, and just paying the extra cost as a gift, but some of those people made a very big mess, which cost me extra to have cleaned. 

Some people said that if I let them use the condo, they would pay for the increased costs. Unfortunately, these people did not keep their word and I ended up paying again. 

I'm very hurt that people would be so disrespectful of my property and my feelings. I loved being able to share my good fortune with loved ones, but very stressed and hurt that people would have so little respect for my home. These irresponsible groups of people have spoiled the situation for the rest of you. It's just too much stress and trouble to let people use my condo. ""

It doesn't really matter *how* the bed gets made, what matters is that it *does* get made. I think you can point out to her that no one sees the way the sheet is tucked once the bed is made, so it's not that important. I suspect that the real deal with the sheets is that they have become symbolic of the whole situation.

I do not think she has OCD. I do think that she has some *anxiety*, and a cluttered or messy house aggravates the anxiety. I'm not even super-clean, and I hate cleaning, but I have found that a clean, uncluttered house is much more relaxing than one that is unclean or cluttered. For her, the anxiety makes the hospital corners a much bigger deal than they really are. 

I believe you when you say you do care about her feelings! What I'm saying is that your actions aren't communicating that to her. When she has to remind you to pick up or put your dishes away, *that is mental labor*. For her, if you were to put your dishes and clothes away without prompting, that's a message to her that you care about her feelings and her need for a clean environment.

&gt;I thought what I was doing was fine.

The problem with this is that you say she *told* you, over and over, that it was not fine. You say she made nice, non-confrontational comments and requests asking you to be more tidy. She asked you not to leave your toothbrush on the counter; you put it away for a few days and then went back to leaving it out. She asked you to not throw your clothes on the floor; you throw them on the floor anyway and pick them up at bedtime. What you communicate, with those actions, is that you know what she wants and you're going to do the opposite anyway. 

So, how could you think what you were doing was fine? 

I remember when my ex and I went to couples therapy, specifically about his refusal to clean up after himself. The therapist asked him ""How did things get to this point, where you're about to break up?"" and my ex said ""I don't know,"" and then he added, ""But that doesn't make sense, because she told me over and over.""",2016-07-23 20:05:44+00:00,d5nybdg,5.0,t1_d5nbe52,55207.0,relationships

Why would you? He didn't lie on his back. He sat down, leaning up against a rock. There was sand in his cuffs, indicating that he had walked on the beach. It appears that he sat down, lit a cig, and then fell asleep while smoking it.

If he had served in the military, as pretty much every man of his generation in the western world *did*, he wouldn't be averse to settling down on the beach for a nap. It was quite late at night and in his poor health, he would have tired easily.

I agree that poison is unlikely, since there was no vomiting. I'm leaning toward positional asphyxia as cause of death; SM was clearly not a well man (from the state of his organs) and it's possible that his already-weakened body was not able to rouse him when he began to smother in his sleep.

1754,"When I read your first post, I was of the opinion that yes, you should let him stay. It sounded in your first post as though he's struggling to get out of poverty and I know from experience that this is hard. I definitely don't think he should be homeless on the street to ""learn a lesson"", because that's not how it works. I do think that you and your other friends are being too hard on him- I went through a similar period when I was in my early 20s, always homeless or on the verge of it, too broke to save up a deposit for the next place, etc, and it wasn't because of my bad decisions, but because of my bad situation (poverty.) 

I'm not sure how you decided that if you let him stay with you there would be ""no move out date"", when you say you were going to have him sign a contract saying it was for 4 months max. But in any case, it is your house and you don't have to let him stay.

I don't like how he pushed your boundaries in this post. He asked for a favor, you said no, he asked for more and more. The idea that you should take 12 hours to drive him to his mom's house is just nuts. The fact that he kept pushing to stay at your house would annoy the shit out of me. It sounds like you made the right choice.

Sometimes desperation makes us behave in ways that are lesser than our best selves.

""No, but it's nice to see you out here on the sidewalk!""

It's really that simple. Use a nice voice, smile when you say it, and then go about your day. They are not ""bombarding"" you and there is no reason for their parents to intervene.

1789,"You probably feel right now that people are being very hard on you, or even hostile, what with all the ""doormat"" comments.

I understand that you got with your husband when you were very young. You were 19 and not very experienced in relationships. Over the years, maybe from the beginning of the relationship, he set certain rules and behaviors as ""how things are"" and normalized those. And because you weren't as experienced as he was, you took his word for what was ""normal"".

Things like:

- You do all the childcare and housework.
- You find alternatives when you can't be at home.
- You don't ask him questions about his whereabouts and he's not accountable to you.

What everyone in this sub is trying to tell you (and some are doing a poor job of it) is that those things *are not normal*.

There is a reason that a 29 year old man seeks out a 19 year old woman for relationships, and none of them are good. He does it because he is looking for someone who will accept his bad behavior and not call him out on it because she doesn't have enough experience to know it's bad behavior, or to know what is a red flag. He's looking for someone who will accept the bare minimum from him as a partner, because it seems like way more than a teenage boy has offered before. He's looking for someone who won't have a lot of other resources.

I'm really sorry. But your husband is not a good husband to you. Your husband lied to you for a month and he's still doing it. When you say you don't know anymore what is a lie and what is the truth- that's a terrible situation to be in. Is it how you want to live the rest of your life? Not being able to trust this man who is supposed to be your closest support?

Unlike a lot of women who find themselves in this situation, you have a good job with a regular income. I suggest that you use it. Get some individual counseling, just you and a therapist, to get more insight on yourself and your relationship. I also think you should go through your husband's phone and call everyone in his contacts to ask them if he's been with them on weekdays and what kind of relationship they have (I would not recommend this in any other situation except one in which a spouse was clearly being dishonest, but your husband IS.) 

I think you are very scared to know that your husband is having an affair and probably has been for a long time. You're scared to know that your husband holds you in contempt, that he does not truly care for you as you want to believe. You are scared to know these things because the logical procession from them is the end of your marriage, and you don't want that! It's normal for you to feel this way.

It would be very childish to not invite your parents.   Even asking them for money for a house seems very entitled and rude, to me.

Basically, any liquid that you coat your skin with makes a barrier between you and pollutants. Sunscreen is great for this because so many of them coat the skin, but liquid makeup also helps to make a barrier.

1880,"It might be that these people have lost all perspective and don't understand what a healthy portion is. It might also be that they feel insecure when you eat small amounts, etc. It could just be that there is an office culture of dining out and they want to preserve that. It doesn't really matter *why* they are doing this, though. 

I understand how important it is to tread lightly and not alienate coworkers, even if the coworkers are the ones with the problem. Even something so small as gently pointing out a coworker's rudeness can cause big workplace problems. 

Since you've tried the normal, polite evasive maneuvers, I think it's time to resort to the white lie.

examples:

""I have to eat lightly at lunch, otherwise I get sleepy and can't concentrate in the afternoon."" (This one is a classic, and for many people it is true.)

""My doctor wants me to eat smaller portions throughout the day, instead of bigger portions at one meal.""

""I have some food allergies so I have to be cautious. It's just easier for me to bring my lunch."" Bonus: if they ask what your food allergies are, say ""We're still trying to pin that down, my doctor thinks maybe food colorings or additives? But he said it's just better for me to avoid dining out for awhile.""

""I have to eat these leftovers before they go bad. I just hate to waste food when I've spent time and money on it already.""

If they are bringing takeout into the office to eat, then bring your lunch to the break room and eat with them. That way you're still participating in the lunchtime social.

You can still maintain your healthy eating if you dine out or get takeout once in awhile. In fact giving yourself an occasional ""cheat day"" helps people to stay on a diet longterm. So every once in awhile, get food with them, eat half of your portion, and say ""I'm saving the rest for dinner, I can't eat another bite right now.""

It's only been 2 weeks, right now you are a new distraction. Eventually they will get used to you, get over it, and move on to something else.",2016-07-17 21:38:28+00:00,d5g2ee3,1.0,t3_4t987k,37686.0,relationships

I do not think you should go spend the night at her house. She is going to do whatever she can to sabotage your independent life. She might sabotage your schooling, or your money, or really anything. 

What your mom is doing is called an extinction burst. You are about to get out from under her control, so she is escalating the controlling and attacking behavior. It is a last-ditch effort to get you back under her control. During this time she is dangerous and unpredictable. 

You DO need to concentrate on school. In fact that's a great thing to say to her: ""Mom, I've realized that you are right, I can't live in two places and concentrate on my schoolwork. My studies are of course important, and you know Dad wants me to put those first. So I won't be coming to stay with you.""

Your mom is an adult and she will be FINE on her own. However, I think you should expect that her harassment of you will escalate.

1933,"&gt;we just really have no idea about the book?

Yep. No idea where SM got the book at all. 

The only thing that links the book to Jessica was that hers was one of a few phone numbers written down in the back of the book. Another phone number was to a bank. 

We also don't have any info indicating that SM was Jessica's boyfriend. For that matter, Alf Boxall was not her boyfriend, either. He was a guy she met a few times. 

It's not really that strange for multiple people to have the same book. Think about how many girls you knew in junior high who had books from the Babysitter's Club series, or the Sweet Valley High series. 

At this point I am figuring that it's just coincidence. 

The only reason, AFAIK, that the police ever even heard about Alf Boxall is that they asked Jessica if she had ever given anyone a copy of the book, and she said ""Yes, I gave a copy to a man I met at a pub 3 years ago, his name was Alf Boxall."" So the police at first assumed that the SM was Alf Boxall, based ONLY on that. 

For some reason, people reading about the case today have assumed that because Jessica gave a copy to Alf Boxall, she gave one to the SM too. 

Something occurred to me today: wouldn't it be a kick if SM didn't know Jessica at all and had written down the wrong number? What if this was all just a string of coincidences?

You tried to make getting furniture a joint project, when it typically isn't.

1966,"This seems like a problem of immaturity and poor communication from *both of you*. 

I think part of the problem is that you established this roommate relationship by letting Cassie *not* contribute financially. From the very beginning the two of you should have worked out who is responsible for what expenses, and put it in writing. It sounds like because she did not contribute to setting up the apartment, and does not buy household goods like TP, *you* decided not to pay the utilities. The two of you should have talked about that and agreed to it. Instead, you think she's freeloading and you feel put-upon. How does she feel?

I don't understand, tbh, why you bought her a desk, ever, in the first place. It is typical for roommates to bring in their own personal furniture for their own rooms. Why would you buy one for her? What kind of agreement did you have about the desk? Who gets it when she leaves?

Your attitude about the sofas is also strange: if you bought them, and she didn't, they are yours. There should not be an expectation that she should pay for them (although it would be reasonable to charge her a little more rent because of wear and tear on these items, and if she damages them she should pay for repairs.) 

I agree that Tom should not pay rent. It's not his apartment. But I also think that you should respect that Cassie wants him there less. It doesn't matter what her reason is: it's her apartment too, she lives there, and if she says she wants him there less often, you should respect that, whether you agree with her reason or not. Even if her reason is just that she doesn't like him, she has the right to feel safe and comfortable in her home. I personally would not want someone I disliked so intensely in my house, especially when I was not home. Continuing to have him over so often is very disrespectful and immature on *your* part. 

I also wouldn't want to come home to a roommate's guest every night or even every week. It's too much. And if you are having guests so frequently, then you *should* be paying for more of the TP, dish soap, etc, because your guests are using them up. 

You need to sit down with Cassie and talk about the financials. Communicate to her how much you have spent on things for the house and for her (the sofas don't count) and see how much she has spent on utilities. Work out the difference so you can come to a fair arrangement. I absolutely think that she has been very immature and freeloading in some ways (she definitely should have been contributing to household goods like TP, paper towels, dish soap) but you have been immature and passive-aggressive also.

1969,"Two problems: 

1- you are very controlling, OP. No matter what happens in this relationship, I think you should get some counseling. Because you want to control your BF's life. 

""I don't like using MJ,"" is not a good reason to ""forbid"" your BF from using it or doing dabs. Same with anything else. Your BF gets to enjoy things that you don't enjoy. While you are welcome to have dealbreakers and your own boundaries, you've chosen instead to try to control his life by making rules for him.

2- Your BF, as you relate the tale, did not tell you that he would never use Xanax. He said he didn't want to use it. Later on, he changed his mind. He has the right to do that. He didn't tell you because your controlling behavior led him (correctly) to believe that you would freak out and accuse him of something. 

I don't consider this a lie or a betrayal. He didn't tell you he was never going to use Xanax. And you don't say that you two have any kind of agreement to tell each other every single thing you do every minute of the day (which would be obsessive). 

Your BF owns his body. He (should) have the right to do what he wants with it. 

You and he have been together for more than 2 years, and you admit that his recreational drug use has not negatively affected your relationship. Yet you still ""worry"" about it. This is a strong sign of an anxiety problem, YOURS. Not his. Yours. 

If you do want to stay with this guy, you need to grow up a little and stop trying to control him. Imagine a world where you can do what you want, and he can do what he wants. Treat your BF like a free person. ",2016-07-15 18:16:27+00:00,d5dlw8p,1.0,t3_4t08tu,3024.0,relationships

1987,"&gt;Maybe the sex was consensual between Jessica and she claimed she was raped to her family so they wouldn't think less of her. 

The reason I suspect rape was Jessica's extremely upset reaction when she saw the bust of SM. I don't think most people would come near to fainting if they just saw a bust of an ex-boyfriend. 

&gt;I feel like a child that was a product of rape would be accepted more than a child conceived during a one night fling.

No, not at all, especially not in the 1940s. Rape victims were despised and a child conceived of rape was considered a monstrous abomination. This is actually why, in the days that abortion was illegal, most doctors would make an exception in the case of rape. It was because people believed that stereotypical rapists were of depraved mind, and that their offspring would also be depraved. 

If my theory is correct, I believe he came back because he heard that she had a son. Men can be very weird about sons, and the early 20th century was not incredibly enlightened. Even today rapists will sometimes sue for custody when a child is the result of their crime.

She is known to have given a copy of the book to another man (someone she met only a few times) several years before, and I think some people assume that therefore she also gave a copy to the SM. 

&gt;he tore out the last section of that copy to keep on him as he died.

This is not accurate. We know that a *piece* of the last page was torn from the book, and it was deep inside the SM's pocket. The piece contained only two words, ""Tamam Shub"". I don't know how much experience you have had with very old books, but it was basically the equivalent of the ""finis"" or ""The End"" that one used to see in a book. We don't know who tore it out, or why. The depth to which it was found in the pocket suggests that something else was put in afterward, shoving it down deep in the bottom. It was so deep down that they used tweezers to remove it.

Something interesting about that: the photo of the book shows that a much larger piece was removed from the book itself. From this larger piece, a small piece was torn, found in the SM's pocket. Where is the rest of what was torn out? The part that was torn from the book was *mostly blank space*, with the words ""Tamam Shub"" at the bottom. Presumably, SM tore it out and then tore it again, removing the words from the larger piece, and shoving the scrap with words on it into his pocket. Maybe he wanted to leave someone a note? 

&gt; It's more like they were lovers, or maybe just close friends or professional colleagues. 

The Rubaiyat is not a book of love poems. And Alf Boxall, the only person to whom Jessica is known to have given a copy of that book, was a near-stranger to her.

2037,"Today, many transsexuals transition, using hormones, as teens or young adults. This was unheard-of in 1991. It is very expensive to transition, and was even more so back then. While some trans women did transition *socially* at a young age, they lacked the funds to go on hormone replacement therapy. So, they continued to develop physically as men. 

(An exception: some poor young trans women would use illegally-sourced birth control pills in an attempt to feminize themselves. This is not as effective as HRT; the hormones are different. Some young trans women had more naturally ""feminine"" features, just as some men do today, but lacked breasts, still had facial hair, etc.)

So, if the person at the party was a MTF transsexual, it is highly unlikely that she would be mistaken for a non-trans woman. 

If the person at the party was a male transvestite, again, it's unlikely he would be mistaken for a non-trans woman, for the same reasons: he would be a normal man wearing women's clothes. It's possible that such a man could have fooled some young, inexperienced men, but probably not a party full of them. 

I'm not saying it's *impossible*, just that I think it's unlikely. I think it's unlikely that this woman would show up and have sex with a roomful of guys she didn't know and that these guys wouldn't find that at all questionable, or notice that they were having sex with someone they considered a man. 

&gt;this would have been an extraordinarily exotic encounter for the young men at the party. 

Not if they thought she was a non-trans woman. 

What I *have* seen is that some men will engage in sex with a trans woman or male transvestite, knowing that the person in question is not a non-trans woman, but if caught, they will claim that they believed she was a woman. This will sound weird, but sometimes they even lie to themselves about it. I've seen straight men come in from the suburbs to a specifically gay neighborhood, visit a stroll where trans* sex workers are known to pick up clients, pick up one such sex worker, and then when they encounter the worker's penis, flip their shit and become violent. It's a very odd kind of cognitive dissonance and self-hatred.

Here's what's going on: your GF is being completely unreasonable. But I think you should cut her some slack here, because grief and fear of loss make people unreasonable. 

Her dog is elderly and near the end of its life. She is scared of losing him. I think you should sit down with her and tell her, gently, that you understand she loves the dog, and feels desperate to save him. But the dog may not even survive this surgery. If he does, a significant chunk of his remaining life will be spent in pain from the recovery. 

She needs to face that her dog is going to die, soon, whether she does this surgery or not. Instead of putting him through the surgery and draining your savings, she should make him comfortable and make the most of his remaining lifetime, and when it's time for him to go, give him a painless death. 

I hope you can feel compassion for your GF in this time. No, her behavior does not make sense, but if you approach it from a place of understanding, you will see that she is reacting emotionally and this does not represent her best self.

It's mostly mannerisms, which are common to liars. One, he talks very quickly and excitedly. That could totally be up to bervousness, but also, he's super-chipper. 

He includes a LOT of detail and tangential information when it isn't necessary. He goes off on tangents that don't actually answer the question or add more information, and makes them very detailed. This is a very common tactic of liars. 

The polygraph (which is garbage) isnt the only reason the sheriff has to doubt them. The search dogs didn't get any hint of the boy's scent at the campsite. 

Sadly, statistically speaking, it is much more likely that he was killed by a parent than that he was abducted by a wild animal. Coyotes hunt at night, bears try to avoid humans. The parents' attorney thinks that the boy was snatched by a bald eagle; bald eagles mainly eat fish and roadkill, I seriously doubt that one snatched the kid.

The reunion is problem #2. If you want to solve problem #2, you must first deal with problem number one. Your stepkids are so badly-behaved that you are embarrassed to be seen with them, and your husband does not understand that this is a problem. You two should see a marriage therapist together, to work on this. It's a big deal. 

You and your husband need to get on the same page about parenting these kids. 

I think you should stand your ground here and go to the reunion without the stepkids. But another option is this: let them and your husband come. When the kids misbehave, let HIM be embarrassed. if your parents give you horrified looks because the kids talk back or steal, hold up your hands and say ""I have tried to get Husband to discipline the kids, but he wont do it and because they are not mine, he won't let me."" Then watch all eyes turn to *him* in horror. 

Potential problem #3: thee kids are going to steal from your daughter, or hurt her, or else rub off on her. This is another reason that your stepkids' behavior needs to be addressed.

Whether you do selective reduction or not is up to you. Whether you to IVF or not is up to you. But you have to ask yourself if, right now, this man shares your values.

Right now your husband is telling you that he values having a boy over your health. He values having a boy over having a girl. He values a boy over your current pregnancy. He values having a boy over just about everything. 

If you do not share these values, your husband is showing you something very scary, and I bet it's extra-scary since you are currently pregnant with multiples. I do think that you did have some warning about this- he was already emphasizing a son before you got pregnant- but now it's not deniable anymore, it's right in your face and it is scary. 

If you do not want to selectively reduce, if you do not want to do IVF in the future just to have a boy, then you need to tell your husband that now and see a counselor right away. The two of you need marriage counseling. If he will not go, go alone. And if he won't go, then you need to think hard about your future.

People who are actively drowning don't usually have control of their hands, they just grab and flail. 

Lifeguards are trained in approaching drowners in ways that minimize risk, but it's still really risky for them. For someone without the training, it can easily be deadly. 

Your local YMCA will probably offer Red Cross water safety classes, sometimes they are even free. I highly recommend them. You can learn a lot that might save lives!",2016-07-07 15:28:15+00:00,d52wf7k,6.0,t1_d52qhpi,9095.0,UnresolvedMysteries

Here's a tip: no one is obligated to give someone else's POV consideration. See, you get to decide what views you consider and which ones you dismiss.

With time, you may notice that these people (like your BF) don't think that *they* are obligated to give every POV consideration, or be open to changing their mind; they only think that *you* are bound by this standard.

Of course it's ridiculous. You don't have to listen to a Neo-Nazi spout his hateful POV. You don't have to consider his POV, or be open to changing your mind about them. You get to have your own standards.

If you stay with this BF, he will keep grinding at you. The things you consider important, he will belittle. His goal is for you to never have opinions of your own or speak your mind. His entire family prioritizes their immediate comfort over justice or love.

2376,"You are incorrect. The process of making pasta compacts the dough into a hard matrix of protein and starches. This hard matrix slows digestion of the starches. Overcooking pasta does two things: one, it gelatinizes the starches. Gelatinized starches are much more digestible than non-gelatinized starches. Two, it breaks up the matrix of proteins that slow the digestion. 

http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/youre-doing-it-wrong-the-guide-to-making-perfect-pasta-946855/?no-ist

&gt;The way pasta is cooked also affects its healthiness. For the healthiest and tastiest way, you want to cook the pasta al dente, which means “to the tooth” or “to the bite.” If overcooked, the GI index will rise, meaning pasta that is cooked al dente is digested and absorbed slower than overcooked mushy pasta.

More technical explanation, though I don't know anything about this website: http://www.montignac.com/en/the-factors-that-modify-glycemic-indexes/

Do not quit your job. You are in an excellent financial situation, and taking time off will set you WAY back. When women leave the workforce, even for a few years, it affects their pay forever. Women typically never make up for that lost time in terms of pay.

2426,"&gt;he just wanted to know the amount to make sure that I am safe, because I live in another state. 

This is so OBVIOUSLY bullshit. I mean, it doesn't even make any sense. It defies any logic. Your dad must be getting desperate for cash if this is the best lie he could come up with. 

Your father's behavior is beyond manipulative. Threatening suicide to get you to give him money is abusive. It's terrible. 

The boundaries you want are normal and healthy. Your dad is not normal or healthy, so he is attacking and manipulating you instead of respecting those boundaries.

I think you have two options here: 

1- Train your dad. 

The way to do this is: when he calls, have a nice normal conversation. As SOON as he starts to pointedly complain about a bill, end the conversation. Say ""Ok, it's been nice talking with you, bye!"" and hang up. Same if he asks for money: say ""It's been nice talking with you, dad, but it's time for me to go."" 

Remember also that you do not have to answer the phone every time he calls. You get to decide when you want to talk to him. So maybe you only answer on Sundays, or you only answer when you're feeling good, or you don't ever answer, and only talk to him when you call him. 

2- be direct. This is what you do if training does not work. 

Call your dad. Tell him that you do not like it when he asks you for money. Tell hm you have given him far more than the cost of the computer, and that you are not going to talk to him about the computer anymore. Tell him you are an adult and that your finances are between you and your husband, and that your dad is not to ask you questions about finances anymore. Tell him this is important to you and these are firm boundaries. 

Tell him that you love him and don't want him to be in difficulty, and offer to pay for him to speak with an independent financial counselor. (Not one who works for a bank.) If your dad needs some help managing his finances, offer to help him to get that help from a counselor. I suspect your dad will reject this offer, but at least you will have made it.

Also, you need to call your stepmom. Unless you and your stepmom have a terrible relationship, I think you should call her and tell her that your dad keeps asking you for money. It is possible that he is tanking their finances and then running to you for money to stop her from finding out. Whichever option you choose, you should speak with your stepmom and make those boundaries clear to her also. 

If after option 2, your dad does not respect the boundaries, the solution is STRONGER and wider boundaries. He calls and asks you for money? Tell him ""You are breaking the rules of our relationship. As a result we will not be speaking for 6 months."" Then you have to follow through. It's HARD. He will act out. He will test the boundaries. Eventually you might just decide to go NC for good in self-defense. Good luck.

Your dad clearly has some shame and embarrassment related to his poor financial skills. This is normal. But it's not normal for him to be coming to you for money all the time. If you refuse him, you will *not* be ruining his life. As it is, you are basically enabling him in the life-ruining, by rescuing him with money whenever he wants it. 

It's hard for you to set these boundaries with your dad, because he harasses you and makes you feel bad. You have to stop just accepting the harassment. I promise it will get easier over time, to say no to him and set boundaries. The more you set and hold boundaries, the better you will feel.",2016-07-05 01:14:51+00:00,d4zgw3s,1.0,t3_4r7j22,37484.0,relationships

2432,"I'm glad it worked for you. It does not work for everyone. Sometimes it makes them worse. The aspect of AA that says relapses are a result of poor character can ruin an addict's self-esteem and make their problem much worse. 

You are a great example of how the social aspect of the program teaches people to be very defensive of it and avoid looking at it critically.

&gt;You can't get reliable data about AA because it's got a revolving door. 

We expect reliable data and a scientific approach about every other treatment modality. Yet AA gets a pass. 

&gt;My friend who was in med school at the time said their addictions module taught that all the top methods, of which AA is one, have about the same low rate of success, BECAUSE IT'S AN ADDICTION. 

Your friend was mistaken. Addiction treatment programs have a low rate of success because we just don't know much about how to treat addiction. Neuroscientists and neuropsychologists are just starting to tackle this, and getting lots of pushback from the AA-loving crowd. 

&gt;do you know what the difference between AA and other methods is? AA is free, and the others cost money. Lots and lots of money. 

This is also not true. (It is a myth promoted by AA.) SMART Recovery, for example, is a free and rational approach to addiction treatment. Also, lots of expensive for-profit rehab programs use a 12-step approach. 

If you want to share anecdotes: my ex was an alcoholic for many years. He got sober without AA or any treatment program whatsoever. He was completely sober for a year, and after that was able to drink occasionally or socially without any problems. This flies in the face of AA doctrine.

That. Is not how medical bills work. 

If you have homeowner's insurance, it ought to cover the medical bills.

How to train a shitty mom: If she makes a comment about your looks, you say ""Mom, I don't want to discuss this with you. I know your opinion and I have taken it into account. Please do not bring the subject up."" Then change the subject. 

If she won't let it go, then you get to say ""Ok, if you insist on continuing to insult me and make negative comments about my appearance, I'm going to have to leave."" Then you do it. You get up and leave. 

Next time you see her, if she brings it up: you say ""I've told you I don't want to hear about this but since you keep it up, I am leaving."" And then you leave.

She says something on the phone? You say something similar, but instead of leaving, of course, it's hanging up. 

If she's not totally insane she will learn to stop bringing it up. My mother is pretty nuts and very narcissistic and abusive, but this method worked to *improve* her behavior, and it worked for several years. It took me hanging up or leaving several times before it started working, but eventually it did work. 

You have to be patient about it, you have to NOT get drawn into a fight, you have to calmly state your boundary and the consequence of crossing it, and when she crosses it, you have to follow through and leave. 

It will take awhile, but if she really wants a relationship with you, she will stop. I suspect that when you do it, she will also get an earful from your dad after you leave.

First of all, working out does not make you fart. Whatever kind of supplements you are taking, if they make you fart, stop taking them. Take different ones. I take a protein supplement every day and it does not make me fart. 

Second of all, stop blaming your wife for your farting. You are an adult who can make your own food decisions. Tamales and refried beans are not ""junky food"". But also, these foods will not make you fart if your digestive health is good. 

Third of all, Jesus H. Christ, you do not need to ""confront your wife"" and if you think that will make your road trip a happy one, you are dreaming. You need to APOLOGIZE to your wife.

There are people out there who, when they see things about themselves that they do not like, will work on themselves and try to be a better person more in line with their own goals. When they see another person who has what they want from life, they try to learn from that person or emulate them in order to get it. Then there are people like your boyfriend, who instead try to tear the admirable people down. 

I strongly advise against marrying someone whose financial values are so different from your own. Someone who frequently overdrafts his accounts will fucking RUIN you financially, especially if he sees your savings as his. Not to mention that he has a bad attitude and attacked you personally over his own shortcomings.

I was surprised as an adult to learn that debt actually *is* good for your credit, as long as you are paying it off. Mind-blowing.

He raped her repeatedly and threatened to kill her. 

Her father had never touched her before or afterward, though. I know her because we were in foster care together. There was no incest, there was a butt grab when he was possibly too drunk to even know she was his daughter. She was 16.

Parents: you say that in your family, people interact by picking on each other and that no one ""means it."" That is probably true to an extent. But it's not how your GF is, and it is not fair for you to expect her to *not feel picked on* when people are picking on her. Your attitude is that your family's ""just like that"" and that she should just believe you when you say they like her.

But for your GF, this is not a loving way of interacting and it hurts her feelings and makes her anxious. You did the right thing in talking to your parents about it; for their part, they should have stopped picking on her and instead being directly friendly. When someone says to you ""This thing you did hurts my feelings,"" you should stop doing it, not tell them that they shouldn't be hurt. 

Your GF should stop muttering under her breath. It's rude. But I am sure that she feels overwhelmed by your family's rudeness. 

Sister: it sounds to me like your sister is a missing stair in your family. She's shitty and acts out toward people, and your parents just say ""Oh, calm down, she's just like that.""

Your BF's seems very selfish and unreasonable. I am especially concerned that he thinks that taking care of you when you were sick is a ""job"" that he should be ""paid back"" for. This is not how marriage works. In a marriage, you care for each other in the ways that you can.

- an orderly routine
- to feel included and respected
- a good night's sleep in a dry bed

All of these needs are reasonable! There is nothing wrong about them.

It is important to frame them to her as *things that you need* that you are asking her to help you get in your mutual life together, not as *things she does wrong and you want to be done differently.*

I suspect that she's feeling overwhelmed with parenting and that by the end of the day she's feeling tired and it's hard to stay on top of things like picking up. 

Are you willing to take on a parental role with the kids? If so, would you, for example, volunteer to get bedtime started or to get the kids picking up the house after dinner? Kids really do need an adult to do the picking up WITH them at their ages, especially the youngest. You can't just send a 4 year old to pick up and expect them to know what to do and how. At the ages these kids are at, an adult needs to be picking up WITH them and in the process, teaching them how to clean up. If she's busy doing other things at 8:00, can you do this with the kids?

These are just some suggestions, if you really want to stay in this relationship and make it work I think you should work with her, or at least offer to do so.

2603,"Your husband and his family are way out of line here.

Before I go into why, I am going to say: I think the niece is lying about the ring. I do not believe she threw it away. I do think her parents would have noticed her opening the car window and throwing something out. So I think the niece either hid it in your house, or in HER house. She probably still has it. Her parents should be looking around their home or MIL's home to find it. The fact that they refuse to help you find it is really disturbing- it says to me that they know it's there and don't want to find it. 

Ok so onward: your SIL should have been super-apologetic and tried to help find the ring. She should be trying now. She should offer to pay for replacing it. She should be making your niece apologize to you. She's not doing any of those things for the same reason she doesn't discipline her kid: she does not care enough about anyone other than herself to make any effort. 

I think you should NOT invite SIL's family to the house, and YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD tell them why AND HAVE YOUR BACK. (Your husband is making things worse by tyring to lie about this shit.) You are being completely reasonable. I honestly would have forbidden the kid from coming over as soon as she terrorized the cat and SIL did nothing about it.

It is not the child's fault she is a terror, it is her parents' fault. But they refuse to take action, so you have to take action to protect yourself and your home. 

Your MIL says ""the ring can be replaced."" She is wrong, and you and your husband should tell her so. The ring cannot be replaced. The diamond that belonged to your mom is irreplaceable. The months that your husband spent working on the ring are irreplaceable. The years of memories and happiness associated with the ring, also irreplaceable. All those things are part of the ring and they cannot be replaced. 

Your husband is letting you down. You should never be forced to have anyone in your home who you don't want there, especially not people who steal from your or let their kids steal from you! He should support you in this. I think you should have the party but SIL and niece cannot come. 

If your  husband will not back you up on this, you two need to get into counseling ASAP. If you don't get this issue hammered out and fixed early in your marriage, you will end up with years and years of anger and resentment over him disregarding your feelings.

2735,"&gt; I don't know if I can handle the way that a conversation like that would go.

The great thing about being an independent adult is that you don't have to have any conversation with them that you don't want to have.

You don't have to make an announcement that you are limiting contact; you can just do it. You get to limit contact to when and how you want. 

A conversation where you ""sit down and broach the topic"" will just turn into them abusing you, so don't do it. Your life, your terms. 

Your family has an abusive dynamic in which you are the scapegoat. I have a family like this too. In my family, anyone who stands up against abuse is villainized and ""the bad guy"". Your family is harassing you because they get off on making you the scapegoat; when you limit contact, they get angry because you are taking their victim away. There's no winning for you if you play that game, so stop playing it. 

You don't have to accept this role. You can live your life on your own terms. If they try to argue with you, just don't get sucked into it. 

Here's a kind of script: say you are on the phone with your sibling and someone tries to start an argument with you. You can say ""I don't want to argue, let's change the subject."" If they keep at it, you have the freedom to say ""Ok, well it's been nice talking to you until now, so I'm going to hang up. Bye!"" and do that.

You can do the same when you are visiting in person; if someone tries to start an argument, you can try to change the subject, and if that doesn't work, you can LEAVE. This is how I trained my abusive, narcissistic mom to behave a lot better. And even if they don't behave better, the good news for you is that you aren't dealing with their BS and arguments and abuse anymore.

It could take a really long time for the OP's mom to be arrested or face ANY consequences for this. In the meantime the little sister lives with her and making a spurious CPS report will just make things harder for the sister.

This is the ONLY way that your mother is going to get help, so it is the best for everyone. You say that your grandmother committed suicide, this is a way to prevent that from happening to your mom.

It's important that you NOT let her ruin your future. Or your sister's future- your sister needs to check HER credit, because I guarantee you that your mom has taken out cards in her name too.

Trevor is the only dad Kyan knows. For Trevor, Kyan is his son and Trevor is his father. You knew this going into the relationship. And that means that your son IS Kyan's brother. If you have a problem with that, you should not have married Trevor.

2929,"I bet it's something like this: 

&gt;I'm kind of conservative and shy about sex. When I was young I let a few boyfriends pressure me into sex that I didn't enjoy, and afterward, I decided to only have sex that I liked and made me happy. I met a guy, and at first we had a great sex life. I enjoyed the sex we had, it was exciting. I became religious and decided to stop having sex until we got married, and he accepted that. 

&gt;Then we got married, and he started pressuring me for sex all the time. He changed a lot; before we got married he was sweet and attentive and made me feel attractive. Now, he is only nice to me when he wants to have sex, and if we don't have sex every time he wants, he withdraws, ignores me, or gives me long lectures where he tells me over and over what a disappointment I am to him, and how I ought to be having more sex with him because he *does so much*. I have asked him to stop the lectures and put-downs because they feel emotionally abusive, but he will not respect my boundaries. 

&gt;I've tried having sex with him when I wasn't in the mood, just to make him happy. That isn't good enough, he complains that it isn't as much fun for him when I'm not into it. But he still does it, so it can't be that bad, right? I've tried giving him a BJ when I'm not in the mood, but he complains about that too. When I *do* want to have sex, about every 2 weeks, he complains that it isn't a different *kind* of sex or a different position, even though other positions are painful for me because I have a tilted uterus. He says our sex life is ""too vanilla"". Sometimes he doesn't even tell me he wants to have sex, but he still gets angry at me for not having it. I feel like no matter what I do, it doesn't make him happy.

&gt;He has a lot of anger issues, and the way he pesters me for sex and then gets angry at me makes me feel unloved and unattractive and scared. It also makes me NOT want to have sex with him. There is no intimacy in our marriage anymore, because any time he is being nice or attentive, it's because he wants sex. I've tried telling him how his behavior makes me feel, but he doesn't care. I feel like I can't trust him with my feelings anymore. We have two children and he does not seem to understand that caring for them all day long is really tiring and I need sleep. He used to wake me up at night for sex, or pester me when I was trying to fall asleep. So I set a boundary and told him not to do that anymore, and he is angry about that.

2941,"Ok, yes, there is an issue of sexual incompatibility here. But that is not all.

From your wife's POV, you sound really entitled and childish. You say that the two of you have fought for years over your desire to have sex more often than she wants to have sex. What this tells me is that for 10 years you've been pressuring her to have sex when she doesn't want to. I agree that *is* abusive and frankly, it makes you even less attractive to her. 

If you are only respecting her love languages in order to get sex, well, it shows, and it doesn't make her feel loved. You say ""I gave her presents and still didn't get sex"" which makes it sound like you think your sex life should be transactional, or that her feelings don't really matter. You should show her love because you love her, not just so you can get sex. She's not a vending machine, in which you insert gift and receive sex. 

&gt;""I shouldn't have to ask for sex on Father's day,"" 

This indicates that you feel entitled to sex. That you think it's a thing you receive as a gift. It isn't. Sex is a way that two people bond, it is not a present your wife owes you.

&gt; I'm not sure if you've ever had the pleasure of having sex with someone who wants to do anything other than fucking you, but it's awful.

Oh, poor you! It couldn't have been that awful, because you did it anyway, multiple times. I don't have any sympathy for you in this regard. ""Poor me, I had sex with my wife when she didn't want to and it was so hard on me!""

The way I see it, your wife is trying to satisfy you and make you feel loved by having sex with you even when she's not into it, but that's still not good enough for you. You're still complaining. You even complain that she doesn't want to have sex in ways that are painful for her! 

While sexual incompatibility is definitely an issue, I think the real problem here is that you pressure your wife for sex and feel entitled to it. You do nice things for her only because you want sex, not just to be nice. You also don't seem to take into account the fact that she really *is* tired after caring for your kids all day. NONE of your behaviors are attractive. 

You also don't respect the boundaries she has tried to set on arguments and how she will discuss things with you; she says she doesn't want to debate things and go over them, but you do it anyway. You said that your goal is to make her agree with you, when the real goal in a relationship disagreement should be to reach a compromise everyone can be happy with.

2954,"No need to apologize! I use a Phillips epilator, I have had my current one since 2013. Before that I had a different Phillips, I bought this updated one because it had more attachments and a light. 

I definitely recommend getting one that includes a light, it makes a big difference. Before I had to set up a bright lamp every time I epi'd.

Mine is not irritating. It DOES make my skin very dry, though, because the tweezers are rubbing against my skin as it runs. YOu will need to exfoliate your legs regularly, because otherwise you can get ingrown hairs. 

Before you epilate for the first time, shave your legs. That way you will only be pulling out a few hairs at a time, it makes it less painful. Also, take an advil or similar beforehand. I usually have some marijuana before I epi. Over time, as you keep epilating, it will be come almost painless. The hairs become much finer and pull out easily. Also, epilate before bed, because after you do it you will have little red spots all over your legs, every place you've ripped out a hair. Apply your BHA lotion then, and the spots wil be gone by morning.

The benefits, for me are: I hate shaving, really hate it. It's so boring and time-consuming. I have pale skin and dark hair and so even right after shaving, the hairs are always visible. Also my legs were never really smooth after shaving, epilating makes them really smooth. If you epilate regularly, you will be able to go longer and longer between sessions. It takes less time than shaving, and I can do it in front of the TV. Also, it feels kind of cool when the hairs pull out. 

My epilator includes an electric razor head, various guards and heads for the epilator, and a pedi stone, which I use regularly. ",2016-06-21 21:38:43+00:00,d4ik75f,3.0,t1_d4i92yg,13805.0,SkincareAddiction

I totally agree! I just don't think that veto is a solution to that. If your partner doesn't think their meta-relationship has a big problem, and you veto the other relationship, it doesn't make your partner able to see the problem. 

In that position, I would rather have a conversation about the problems I see, hear the SOs opinion on that, give them my POV, and then let them make their own decision like the autonomous adult that they are. Sometimes that might mean trusting *their* judgment, and letting them make mistakes that might mean that they get hurt. Part of being a grown-up is taking responsibility for your bad decisions.

3028,"HI, I'm a long-time poly person here. All my advice below presumes that you and your husband are on the same page here and he does not share her intentions.

Your husband needs to sit down with his GF and have a serious talk with her. He should return her ring and say that wearing it would cross a boundary in his actual marriage (I mean, some poly people would be ok with this, but you are not, so he should not wear it.) 

He should tell her very directly and in no uncertain terms that he will not ever be in a monogamous relationship with her. He should also tell her that her frequent expression of this desire is troubling to him, and that he doesn't want to hear it anymore, and that she needs to respect his marriage.

Then see what is her reaction. Your husband is setting a boundary and if she will not respect it, he needs to break things off, even if that hurts. 

I, personally, try not to date people whose other relationships are troubled, especially when the other relationship is a marriage. I understand that your husband's relationship with GF is long-established, but I still think it would be fair for him to say ""Hey, let's spend less time together so you can concentrate on your marriage.""

Although I am not usually jealous, I AM territorial so I totally understand why this bothers you so much. Her behavior is unacceptable and not respectful of your husband, or you, or your marriage. She's aggressing on your marriage and has stated outright that she wants to end it, and I would not be comfortable having someone like that as my metamour.

I think that all living creatures are composed of energy and matter. When we die, the matter in our body decomposes and eventually becomes part of something else. Every element in your body, or your dog's body, was once part of a star, cosmic dust floating around the universe. When I die, the body that I identify as mine/me will be gone, but the elements of it will still exist in other forms.

It seems logical to me that something similar happens with the energy part of us. So I think that the energy part of your dog will go on to be part of the energy of other living things, or of other nonliving things with energy (think of a thunderstorm or a star.) The energy part of me- whatever it is that makes my personality and memories and life- will be gone, but all of that energy will still exist. 

Sometimes after someone dies, part of that energy can get stuck. I think that's what happens in haunting (but I think that most reported hauntings are imaginary or hoaxes.) But for the most part, I think it lives on and goes elsewhere.

3094,"&gt;A century ago, families were more like cults. Til death did they part. 

Eh, this is really a myth that has been carefully fostered by American media, especially fiction. This myth has persisted for a long time because most records were inaccessible to the average person. Now that they are being digitized, we are seeing a different picture of the American family.

In fact while legal divorce was less common a century ago, it did exist, especially for upper classes who could afford it (including being able to afford traveling to a different jurisdiction if necessary.) Even more common (especially among the poor and rural people) was *informal* divorce, where one party of a marriage just left and sometimes went elsewhere and started a new family. Add in the high rate of death in childbirth for women, and death via war for men, and there was a LOT of family separation and remarriage going on.

It wasn't that uncommon for young people to move away from their parents and extended family. That is actually what most Europeans who came to America did. Also when I made my previous comment, I was specifically thinking of my great-great-grandfather; he and his dad did not get along, so when he was 15 he ran away from home and went to live in a nearby town with some friendly acquaintances! (This was in the mid-late 19th century.) If he had been killed by robbers on the way or something like that, he could have been another disappeared person or unidentified body.

The records show us that ""the American family"" has been broken down ever since colonization, because the European family was already broken down and further broken by colonization, and indigenous families were specifically targeted for destruction by the government.

He's not a medical pro and he doesn't understand your ED. Why shouldn't he be left out of your recovery process? He obviously wasn't helpful when he tried to insert himself. 

I am curious, why did you not see your therapist as soon as you started relapsing? It sounds like you are very very conscious of your relapse, and not in denial, so why are you putting off medical help?

I hope that you get some help and peace soon.",2016-06-16 08:51:45+00:00,d4bcz3s,1.0,t3_4oc6qe,4503.0,relationships

3115,"&gt; From the description of him being a kind young man, I would think that if he wanted to kill himself, he wouldn't lead his parents on with a note saying he's coming back. 

I think he might have thought it was kinder to let them think he was gone on a space journey, than to let them know he had committed suicide. Death aside, suicide in particular carries with it a huge stigma especially for people of some religions. The letter hints in a way at suicide; he's coming back but he won't need his money or belongings when he does? 

The real mystery, if that's the case, is what led Granger Taylor to want to kill himself OR to believe that a UFO was going to pick him up. He was too old to develop schizophrenia.

3117,"There are basically two ways to train cats: conditioning, and also knowing what cats like and manipulating them. Hah. 

Positive reinforcement: do a google search for ""clicker training."" I had one really weird cat who was difficult to transition, and I used clicker training to get her to use the scratching post, and get her to use a litter box consistently. 

Aside from clicker training moments, when the cat does something you want, give the cat some kind of positive reinforcement. When the cat uses the litter box or the scratching post, give it a treat or some positive attention like petting or play. I do not use the clicker on the cats I have now, they respond very well to praise and treats or petting, so I didn't bother. 

The STRONG NO. When you see the cat misbehaving, don't yell, but say NO in a strong voice that is pitched a little deeper than your normal speaking voice. It might not work the first time, but it might, and eventually it will. I've had this work on feral cats even- they hear the strong no and they stop what they are doing and look at me in absolute shock. It's like *they* don't even know why they stopped. 

If the cat stops what they are doing when you give the no, praise the cat. If the strong no is not enough, it's time for the water bottle.

The water bottle: get a good spray water bottle and set it on ""stream"". When the cat does a naughty thing, give the strong no and spray the cat with the bottle. You usually only have to do this a few times. I only have to bust out the water bottle every 3-4 years. 

Manipulation:

the cat that was clicker trained had a bad habit of pooping or peeing in my potted plants. In addition to giving her click reinforcements when she used the litter box, I put all of the potted plants off of the floor to make them less accessible/inviting to her. Basically, you have to make the litter box the most inviting place to pee and poop. It should be in a quiet area where the cat has a way to escape. And you should have at least 1 litter box per cat, plus one. 

If your cat claws the couch, get a scratching post and place it near the couch. Put clear packing tape flat on the area where the cat claws the sofa. The cat will naturally find the post more appealing than the sofa, and eventually you can begin moving the post away from the sofa, only a few feet at a time, maybe once a week or twice, until you get the post where you want it to stay. 

Before you buy a post, watch your cat clawing things and see how they do it the most. One of the cats likes to stand up on her hind legs, hook her front claws into something, and then kind of ""hang"" downward. So we bought her an upright post for scratching. My other cat likes to crouch down and hook her claws into the floor (or couch if she's on that) and stretch and claw that way, so we got her a horizontal scratching post (and she loves it, she destroys each one in about 2 years.) The key is to make sure that whatever post the cat has, matches the way that particular cat prefers to scratch stuff. I have found tht it's good to have more than one post around, each of our cats has her own (and seriously, they do not share).

We also give them cardboard boxes to play with, they will claw those, play in them, chew on them, etc. Crumpled packing paper with catnip inside is a big hit.

Sometimes getting a cat to use the litter box is similar to putting the scratching post near the sofa. One of my cats once started peeing on the floor about 5 feet from the litter box. We move the litter box to the place she was going, and that solved the problem. Over the next few months we were able to gradually move the box back to where we wanted it. 

If you have cats who are really really insistent on clawing a carpet that you don't want them to claw, there are these mats that are usually used in offices, they are put onto carpeted floors to make them more smooth so rolling chairs can roll on them. The mats are smooth on top, but on the bottom they have tiny plastic spikes to anchor them in carpet. You can get one of these and place it on the carpet with the spikey side up. Cats do NOT like to walk on those! 

They also need toys and play time. Sometimes a destructive cat just needs to have more intense playtime, so if you set aside 5-10 minutes in the evening for play, that can tire the cat out and also make it calmer and more happy. 

That's all I can think of off the top of my head right this second, good luck :) ",2016-06-16 04:19:11+00:00,d4b6t7r,6.0,t1_d4aoa5i,28220.0,relationships

3120,"&gt; I mean they are not fully domesticated 

What? Of course cats are fully domesticated. Lots of domesticated animals can survive in a feral state, or crossbreed with wild relatives, but it doesn't make them undomesticated. 

I have two cats and they are basically glued to me every waking second, and some sleeping ones (my siamese sleeps next to me and hugs my leg.) Siamese in particular are a breed known for being very affectionate and needy of human companionship, and people who spend long hours away from home are not advised to adopt them. 

My other cat is a former feral. What I've noticed about ferals is that though feral, the domesticated traits bred into them are still strong. Feral cats don't go far from human settlements, whereas a truly wild cat does. Feral cats simultaneously yearn to humans, and fear us. This cat was initially terrified of humans, but I started sitting out in the yard, where I would quietly speak to her, and she got closer and closer. Now she's a total love bug, when my boyfriend comes home from work she screams at him until he picks her up and hugs her like a little baby. 

I've read quite a lot about cats and cat behaviorism and what I've read says pretty much the opposite of what your research has yielded. ",2016-06-16 02:12:23+00:00,d4b2ddt,7.0,t1_d4awpn0,8948.0,relationships
3121,"Here's how it was possible: 

First of all, this was in the first 6 months we were dating (he had been drinking for years and years at that point, but only the last ~6 months of it overlapped with our relationship.) He says that when he started dating me, he had already realized that he had a problem and was trying to cut back. 

He had his own place and I had mine. (We moved in together a few years later, but this was early on.) Also I worked the night shift at a hospital, from 9 or 10pm until 7 or 9 am. I did this 4-5 nights a week. So basically he was getting drunk when I was at work, or on nights that we had a date he would get drunk after our date was over and we went home to our respective houses. 

The other thing is that I was in my early 20s and I'm just not a very suspicious person. I am (unfortunately) too trusting, and even more so back then. And he was long-practiced at hiding his drinking. He had been doing it since he was 16. 

Right around the 6-month mark, I saw him get way drunk and he behaved really, really badly. The next morning we had a Come To Hogfather talk and he got sober. He was appalled when I told him the things he had done the night before. 

I'd like to think that this kind of thing wouldn't be able to happen if I was living with someone, but tbh I just don't know. I don't think I've ever actually been aware of the smell of liquor on someone, it just occurred to me that maybe it's because I grew up with alcoholics (my dad was a drunk, I was mostly raised by my mom's parents, also drunks, and they enabled the hell out of their son/my uncle, who was also a drunk. Most of my dad's &amp; uncle's friends were drunks and my mom, though not a drunk, worked in a bar and had no friends.) So maybe I had that smell around me all the time when I was a kid and so I've never identified it as a particular smell. 

But it's also possible that it's because as an adult, I have chosen to avoid alcoholics. Sure, I like to party and sometimes I even get drunk, but I avoid spending time with or getting close to people who have substance abuse problems. I had enough of that shit in my childhood.

3124,"Scientists studying schizophrenia have found that there does seem to be a genetic correlation between schizophrenia and creativity; families with a high proportion of creative people also tend to have a higher proportion of schizophrenics. The working theory is that there is some group of genes which in moderation lead to creativity, but in too much abundance lead to schizophrenia. 

The problem with the schizophrenia theory, though, is that men who develop schizophrenia do so in their late teens or early 20s.  It would be rare for him to have schizophrenia and not show signs of it earlier. And believe me, schizophrenia is typically not a minor illness or one easily hidden.

I found a newspaper article which said that parts of Granger's truck, along with fragments of human bone, were found on Mount Provost in 1986. The truck appears to have been exploded with dynamite. The RCMP says that the bones are presumed to be Granger's. So I would say that this is not really an unresolved mystery anymore.

What this is really about, as you have guessed, is that he is still carrying a lot of self-hatred and he is projecting that outward. I think that you and your wife and whichever friends he has left should communicate that to him. 

It's probable that he was always secretly this much of an arrogant jerk on the inside, but he didn't feel confident enough to express that. Now he feels confident and he thinks that being not-fat makes him untouchable or likeable enough to be a jerk without consequence. 

Also, the trauma he experienced from your stepmom; many times abuse victims become abusers themselves. Your brother has become abusive. Before, he was dealing with his emotional problems with food; not he's dealing with them by abusing other people. This is NOT okay. You say you've always felt protective of him; is it possible that this is a role created for you by family dysfunction? My mother's older brother was a constant heartache to the whole family, an addict, an abuser, a general screw-up, but she felt like she had to protect and take care of him because her mother drilled that into her as a kid. 

 It's really messed up, in my opinion, that having come from a situation where he was overweight and worked to lose it, he would mock people in that same situation (like the woman on the treadmill. She's doing the same thing he did, only probably without the benefit of surgery. So why is he shaming her?)

TLDR: You don't want to be in the middle anymore. So don't be. The next time someone else in your family voices a complaint about Ryan, say ""Yes, he has major emotional problems and I wish he would get help."" Don't defend him- why should you? You don't like how he is acting either! Don't argue with him about his behavior, because all it does is stress you out.

3184,"&gt; Is it common for alcoholics to go from 0-100 like that - from hiding it so well that not even their nearest and dearest know, to having a full-on public meltdown?

Yes. In fact it's even common for them to do it several times. Usually, they trash one set of friends/family, make an effort to get sober, go get a new set of friends, then repeat the cycle and alienate the new people. 

No one outside of my immediate family knew that my sister was an alcoholic, until she was arrested for DWI. She had even had arrests before that, but no one knew about them; the last one got media coverage and she actually went to jail, so some people found out. But a lot of people never knew. 

My BF's mom is an alcoholic and no one in her own family knew until she was hospitalized with liver failure! Even then, most of them did not know, she hid it very well. They found out because my BF called every single one of her family members and told them she was an alcoholic and to please stop giving her money.

&gt;I would have expected that as the alcoholism gradually got worse there would be more and more indications - problems at work, people noticing something a bit off, stuff like that - before this kind of public disintegration. Am I wrong?

You're not wrong, but what you don't know is that a)people at work don't see your whole life and b)alcoholics are good at covering up their drinking. Also c) denial is very powerful. 

So when things go wrong at work, that's a problem at work. At work no one asks if your problems at work are related to alcoholism, they just write you up or fire you or something. The alcoholic tells family ""That job sucked anyway,"" or ""I quit,"" or ""The boss didn't like me.""

When people notice that something is ""a bit off"", they might say something, they might not. The alcoholic will say ""Oh, I'm just tired today,"" or ""I have a cold and these allergy meds are really making me spacey"" or ""I think I'm coming down with something.""

Some people never have a public disintegration. My ex was an alcoholic for a long time, then he decided to get sober. He never had a public ""rock bottom"" moment and so most people around him never knew that he got blackout drunk every night. Including me.

So I think you should be polite to her and try to be somewhat familial. This does not mean you don't get to set boundaries, though: you told her not to touch you, she touched you anyway. She's technically committing assault, and though you probably don't want to call the cops, slapping her hand away or saying loudly ""I told you not to touch me!"" is perfectly acceptable. 

About your kids: do you think this woman is going to stay married to your dad? If so, she's going to be in their lives, and she's married to their grandfather.

It will be more confusing and unsettling for them if they are not allowed to have a relationship with her. 

So, I would let your kids decide for themselves what degree of relationship they have with Nancy, which means NOT trying to prevent a relationship.

This is very common in alcoholism. There are many secret drinkers out there. My BF's mom is an alcoholic and we have been trying to convince her family for YEARS that this is true. She has liver failure from cirrhosis and they were still in denial of her drinking until very recently, and they still keep denying how bad it is. 

She literally DWI'd her sister's car over a median and bent the axle, then claimed she had no idea how the car got damaged and her sister believed that because of DENIAL.

3218,"Denial is very, very strong in families with alcoholism. So strong. And alcoholics are very, very good at hiding their drinking. It isn't surprising that her SIL had never seen her drink more than sparingly. 

It is not at all uncommon, in the aftermath of a death from substance abuse, for family and close friends to say that they had no idea that the deceased had a problem, or even to say that they NEVER used that substance. It's a way that people cope. In part this is because our society places such a stigma on addiction and considers it a moral failure. 

It's possible that Diane's drinking problem developed over time, and was hidden from her family, and that the day of the accident was the day it reached critical mass. Most people don't become a problem drinker in one go, it slowly creeps up on them. I don't think this was a suicide, I think she was drunk, really really drunk, and probably had no idea she was going the wrong way on the highway. I am skeptical of passing drivers' ability to interpret her facial expression as ""serene and determined"" considering that she was drunk, they were panicking, and they saw her face for less than a second. 

There have been multiple cases of drunk drivers hitting pedestrians or cyclists and literally *not knowing* that they were driving around with a person in their windshield. That's really drunk! 

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/21/cyclist-driver-didnt-see-me-stuck-in-windshield/4718857/

WRT marijuana, there's really no way for a medical examiner or a tox report to tell you how impaired she was, or to declare that she had used it right before the crash. That is not how marijuana works in the human body: it persists for a very long time after use and even after the high recedes. There can be high levels of THC in your system even if you are not currently  high. So I think that the focus should be on the alcohol, which was very high and which was found in the car.

Altogether I think this is a terrible tragedy caused by drunk driving. And that's really sad. ",2016-06-14 01:44:09+00:00,d485u68,1.0,t3_4nwud2,28246.0,UnresolvedMysteries

The good news is that you are an adult and you don't have to discuss this stuff with them. You need to practice setting boundaries.

&gt;how am I supposed to reduce my intimidation factor?

By dating way, way up. You are very accomplished, so insecure people feel intimidated. you need to seek out partners who are similarly accomplished or who are very very secure with themselves.

A child needs to have adequate support, and if Jack were to give up his parental rights, he wouldn't have a legal obligation to pay child support. 

So, Jack cannot just sign away his rights like he (and a lot of people in this sub) think that he can. Pretty much the only situation in which he would be allowed to do that would be if Marla has a husband who wants to adopt the child. 

WRT being a ""support check only"" parent, I, personally, would never be involved with a man who abandoned his child in such a way. I couldn't respect someone who created a child and then ignored it. Children have emotional needs as well as financial ones.

3434,"I think maybe you're confused about what kind of centers these are. Adoption/foster care are not the same thing. They are completely different. 

In the US, if a woman is pregnant and wants to place her child for adoption, she usually goes through a private agency; these are usually organizations that have some state oversight, but are not government agencies. They are essentially companies in the business of adoption. The exception is that some states allow ""private adoptions"", in which the adoption is mediate by an attorney and there is little to no state oversight. In these case the infant is typically handed off to the adoptive parents at birth. 

Children who are abandoned or who are taken by the state go into state custody, and sometimes that means they go into foster care (sometimes they are placed with family instead, or go to a shelter, or a group home.) If the rights of the parents are stripped by a court order, then the child may be offered for adoption by the state. 

There is no state mechanism for someone to decide to ""adopt out"" their child when the child is older (which is as it should be, because children are not objects to be bought and sold or given away.) Sometimes this kind of thing does happen, in private adoptions (I know one reprehensible person who offered her 8 month old infant to some friends because he cried more than her other babies had and it made her feel bad; in that case the friends did adopt him).

3477,"Thanks! 

Based on the edit I would say that your wife doesn't really like your mom, finds her annoying, and is, either consciously or unconsciously, projecting this annoyance onto the babysitting relationship. It does sound as though your wife is being unreasonable. 

A lot of the time, people are very rigid and freaked out with their first baby, and think everything has to be regimented. It really doesn't. I agree with you that caregivers should be trusted to use their judgment in caring for a baby- I mean, if he was asleep, it's ok that he didn't have his yogurt. 

There is a phrase that is abbreviated ""BEC"". The first word starts with a B and is outlawed in this sub, but the other two words are ""eating crackers"". The idea is that when you strongly dislike someone, everything they do gets on your nerves. ""Look at that b*** eating crackers like she owns the place."" It sounds like your wife has gone BEC with your mom. 

This isn't good for anyone involved, including your son, and I think that you and your wife should get some counseling over this. Your mom has been a mom before and presumably understands that you can chill out about when the kid gets yogurt. He will eat it eventually. Your wife has not been a parent before and is very high-strung right now. I think it's possible she is experiencing some PPD and it is manifesting as anxiety and controlling behavior.

I do think that your wife should understand that a babysitter has to be flexible about feeding, working around the baby's sleep and eat needs. 

But, this part is really important: if your son was born at the end of 2015, he is to young to be having juice or yogurt. He should be having only breast milk or formula until he is 6 months old. After that he can start on other foods. There is ZERO reason for him to ever have juice. It is just sugar water and promotes tooth decay. So, the regimen that your wife wants your MIL to follow is actually not a good one, it is a dangerous one, and you should talk to your pediatrician about it. A baby's gut is not ready to digest those foods before 6-8 months, and a baby's gut is also very permeable, so eating foods other than breast milk or formula at his age is not good for him and can lead to food allergies or other immune problems.

3506,"I think two things:

One, next time this happens, CALL HER OUT. Don't wait until later. Call her out. You or your sister or both of you together should call her out and point out that what she is saying is ridiculous and abusive. If she tries to backpedal with ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" don't let her. Pin her to the wall. She knows what she is doing, and she keeps doing it because she gets away with it.

If she says ""I didn't mean to offend her,"" then point out that you have raised this issue with her before and told her it was offensive, and she keeps doing it over and over. So clearly she does mean to offend.

If she offers a half-hearted apology, point out that she always does that and then goes on to do the same thing. If you are really sorry for doing something, you don't keep doing it. 

No one honestly thinks that calling another person a liar or a slut is not offensive. So if she tried to say that she didn't mean to offend, I think you can call her out on that and point it out. 

I agree that your FSIL is emotionally abusing your sister. If your brother won't stop her, a last resort is for you and your sister to sit down with him ALONE with a list of offensive things she has said and tell him that she is hurtful and abusive and that it hurts you that he chooses to be with someone like this and does not step in and defend your sister. 

If he won't take action, you are justified in cutting your SIL out of your lives and not going to the wedding.

3559,"&gt; What I'm now asking is if there is a way to allieviate the symptoms ON THE WAY TO addressing the problem as a whole

Yes, and people are explaining to you over and over that the only way to ""alleviate the symptom"" (bedwetting) is for him to quit drinking. 

&gt;which I don't believe is my place this early in

When do you think it would become your place? This guy's alcoholism is already causing him to pee in the bed with you while you sleep, so it's obviously already affecting your life. There is no number of months together that will make it your place to say something, if it isn't your place now.

It is reasonable at *any* time for you to say to your boyfriend ""Your substance abuse is a problem and it's affecting my life negatively. I need you to make real changes in order for me to stay in this relationship."" This is *totally* your place, because you get to decide what's acceptable in *your* life and how you want to live that life. 

True story: my uncle was an alcoholic and when I was a kid, I was exposed to his drunkenness and its effects. This included wetting the bed, having a room in the house that always smelled of pee (because my mom often let him live with us, and my grandparents would let him live with them too.) For whatever reason, no adult in my family would ever tell him that his behavior was a problem for everyone and that he needed to stop drinking. It took literally almost dying and spending months tied to a bed detoxing to get him sober. Basically everyone walked around pretending that there wasn't a problem. 

He was sober for a decade, then he went back to drinking. Again, everyone pretended there was no problem. They just ignored it. At this point I was an adult and I was literally the only person in our family, or among his friends, who would say to him ""You are killing yourself with drinking and if you're drunk I can't talk to you."" No one else would make any effort to get him sober, and he did in fact die. He died on the floor in a pile of his own shit and piss. That is the direction your boyfriend is going, and you do have a chance to change it. Even if he does not decide to quit, at least you will have made an effort.",2016-05-26 21:02:29+00:00,d3kya4h,9.0,t1_d3kt4a1,6682.0,relationships

3564,"&gt;  is there anything I can do to help him not wet himself?

No, because the cause of him wetting the bed is alcohol. Alcohol is a diuretic. It's also a particular kind of sedative, in too-large amounts it shuts off the part of your brain that holds in your pee when you are asleep. He is wetting the bed ONLY because of his extremely high alcohol consumption.

This is why people think you are in denial or are enabling: because you are asking how you can stop him from wetting the bed BEFORE dealing with his alcoholism, when the alcoholism is the problem. You are in denial of this reality, pretending that they are not the same problem, when they are.

A thought on cheating and attraction: I have noticed that when guys cheat, it is almost always with someone less attractive than their wife/GF.

3578,"&gt;It's not common for a standard frame house fire to burn so hot that it leaves absolutely nothing behind of the bodies. 

Ok, that makes sense. But what about a standard frame house with a coal chute full of coal in the basement? The house was heated by two coal stoves, requiring a coal chute by which coal was delivered to the house (the coal chute info comes from an old thread in this forum.) The entire house supposedly collapsed into the basement within 45 minutes, which indicates that the fire was very hot. Coal burns very hot, and children have smaller bodies with less dense bone, so they can cremate at lower temperatures or faster at a high temp. 

According to NPR, the firefighters found pieces of bones and pieces of organs in the remains of the house, but did not tell the Sodders.  The fire marshall asked Mr. Sodder to leave the site alone until a more thorough search could take place, but Mr. Sodder bulldozed the site and filled in the basement with dirt a week or so later, and then began insisting that random strangers' children were his. 

I think it's likely that the fire was arson, and that someone broke into the house to start it, but there are a lot of reasons to doubt the Sodders' story on this.

This doesn't make any sense. By that logic, the sunscreen (the actual SS-providing ingredients) are ""diluted"" in any liquid or cream sunscreen. None of us are coating our faces with pure ZO every day, we are using products that contain sun-screening ingredients along with others.

I'm in my 40s, btw, and have worn SS every day since I was 18. During that time I've spent at least an hour outdoors every day (because I've never had a car.) People tend to estimate that I am in my late 20s. I have no age spots and I only get wrinkles when my skin is dehydrated (in fact I had more wrinkles when I was in high school than I have now.

3740,"&gt;I don't think contacting authorities would be dangerous.

Of course you don't, or I would hope you would not suggest it, but you are wrong. 

You think that CPS is going to show up and tell her mom to do some parenting classes or therapy and everything will be hunky-dory. 

Here is what will really happen: CPS will inform OP's mom that there has been an abuse complaint against her. OP can deny all day that she is the one who called CPS, but her denial will not matter, because her mom will still think that OP is the one who called. Abusers have their own ""logic"" and the fact that you think that the OP can just say ""Nope, it wasn't me,"" and that will guarantee her safety indicates that you don't really understand this situation. 

Once CPS informs OP's mom that there was a complaint, two things can happen. 

One, they don't do anything. This is the most likely scenario, as the OP is a few months away from leaving home to go to college. CPS tends to give less attention to complaints about abused teens than they do to complaints about younger children; their ""logic"" is that the teens are older and will be leaving home soon. In this case the OP is almost a legal adult, so CPS is likely to just tell her to tough it out until she's 18, or tell her to go ahead and move out on her own. 

If she were a little younger, CPS might start questioning the family. The family will almost certainly close ranks to protect the OP's mom. Nothing will come of the investigation.

In either situation, the OP would be in danger of escalation from her parents. She would face increased harassment and possibly violence from her mom, and her dad might withhold access to her college money. ",2016-05-17 23:54:26+00:00,d39iu6i,4.0,t1_d38vhlu,30771.0,relationships

3800,"&gt;My question is, how do I convince them to actually pay me

They are never going to pay you the money they owe you from past babysitting. They are also never going to pay you for babysitting if you keep doing it for free. So stop babysitting for free. It's really that simple. 

&gt;and see that what they're doing is unfair? 

What? My dear, they KNOW that they are being unfair. They do not care. They are getting what they want out of the situation, so they have no need or want to change anything. 

If you like spending time with your nieces and nephews, then set up times to visit with them. But next time your bro or SIL want you to babysit, say no. It's really that easy. You can say ""Sorry, I'm not available that night,"" or even ""I can't keep babysitting when you won't pay me,"" if you want. But you can also just say ""no.""

Also, you and Andrew both should stop loaning them money, selling them things, giving them things, etc. And definitely don't let them in your house unattended.

3803,"A lot of people are proposing very aggressive and insulting responses. While those are fun to think about, they won't result in a good ending for YOU, OP. Making rude comments about your relatives' choices or skills with money will just move you to a level *below* theirs in terms of behavior, and will lead to arguments and acrimony. 

What kind of ""help out with the kids"" are they asking for? 
If their demands are coming in vague terms, like ""help out"" I think you should just ignore them. I say this because if you just say no to that, they will just ask differently. If they ask for something specific, like a specific amount of money, then you have a real number you can say ""no"" to. In that case the easiest way is for you to say, as another user suggested, ""Sorry, I've committed that money elsewhere.""  You might even add ""I also have bills to pay, you know."" If they demand to know details of your expenses, ignore them. You don't have to answer questions other people ask, just because they ask them.

If they really mean they want you to just help support the children on a daily basis, that is a bit much.

I haven't seen any proof yet that the ""vials of drugs and syringes"" were his. From what I have read about the case, some sources say Sunny was diabetic and some say she was not. If she was diabetic, drinking alcohol was dangerous for her and could throw her sugars off and put her into a coma, easily.

My grandmother was a diabetic and a contemporary of Sunny's. I don't know if this is still the case, but at least until the late 80s, insulin had to be refrigerated. So I don't believe that anyone was carrying around a vial of insulin in a black bag. 

When Sunny went into a coma, Bulow opposed terminating life support. He also freely signed away all rights to her estate, while she was still living. It's hard to believe he would have done so if he killed her. 

The expert witnesses contradicted one another, and many of Sunny's friends testified that she was a frequent drug user. Her hospital records also showed that she had overdosed on aspirin before going into the hospital, and the syringe that supposedly had insulin on it, only had it on the outside. If she had been injected, there would be insulin inside. 

It's possible that he killed her, sure, but it doesn't look very *likely*, and it looks more probable that someone framed him, probably someone in the family.

3972,"Well, all foods will cause the body to release insulin after eating. Carbs alone cause a higher rise in sugar, and in insulin, than proteins, usually. You are correct that protein usually causes a slow, steady stream of BG into the blood, but I am encountering sources saying that WPI is different and causes a spike akin to carbs. 

In my case (RH) the body overreacts to a rise in BG and dumps too much insulin. This causes a corresponding BG crash. If RH is uncontrolled the insulin spikes lead to insulin resistance. Some sources say that WPI raises insulin resistance as well as spiking insulin, which is a bad idea for me either way.

There is no reason that any  one runaway would know more than a few other runaways from her same region, or even know the history of more than a few of the ones she knows. Not all missing women are runaways, not all runaways stay ""missing"". I don't believe that you ""know how to contact a lot of missing girls"". I certainly didn't when I was one. 

(Also the ""junkie whore"" trope is an appeal to mainstream fantasies. Because if you really know a lot of ""missing girls"", then you know some who have good lives, like me.

3985,"Here is my experience: I had an absent father who violated the terms of visitation repeatedly, so he lost it. He never paid any child support. He never made any legal effort to be in my life. 

Meanwhile, his mother was telling me all the time how much he loved and missed me and that I could live with him when I was older, etc.

As a child this was very confusing and upsetting to me. Because if he loved and missed me, then where was he? Why didn't I see him? According to my grannny, it was because *my mom wouldn't let him see me.*

So eventually your kid is going to ask the same questions: if he misses me so much, where is he? And her dad's family are going to tell her that you won't let her see him.

So I think first you should see what other child care options are available to you. Your university might have a childcare program (the ones in my city do and so did the one I went to) and there might also be other options for low-income parents as well. Your daughter is old enough for pre-K and as a single mom you ought to be eligible for it. Then kindergarten. 


Even if you can't entirely replace them as sitters, you can start reducing the amount of time she spends with them. 

Also reach out to your ex's dad, see if he has any insight to offer, if he is friendly. 

And then I think you're going to have to sit down with your ex's mother and sister and tell them that when they tell your daughter that her dad misses her, they are confusing and upsetting her. He needs to tell her himself and more importantly SHOW her by getting his shit together and being a parent. Tell them that if they keep telling her that, she will be spending less time with them.

Be sure to tell them FIRST that you appreciate them being in her life and that you are glad they have good , loving relationships with her. Don't tell them you need them for childcare.

This is going to be a balancing act until your daughter turns 18, so it's good to get practice setting boundaries NOW and establishing that you are her mom and you make the rules.

Agreed, this set off my spidey sense.

No, it doesn't. In my state a single complaint means a case is opened. An investigation is done, and the case is either closed or left open. 

This is all based on ow things are *supposed* to go, though, not on the reality, which is that case workers ignore reports, falsify documents, and basically only do about 10% of the work assigned to them, if that.

4103,"&gt;Indigenous Americans are similar it terms of anthropology and genetics with some Asian groups (especially, with several Eastern Siberian tribes) but not identical. 

There is a lot more to this story than that, and actually, if you take mito DNA into account, the similarities span Asia and eastern Europe. But DNA was obviously not a consideration, because again, this was 1991.

Since DNA can be ruled out as their way of determining his status, I was thinking about this in terms of physical attributes.  I am Native and my good friend is Chinese-American (his mom is white.) We both have, for example, hooded eyelids, shovel teeth, valgus knees, and tori palatinus. People routinely tell him that he doesn't ""look Chinese"" and non-natives will often say that I don't ""look"" Native, because the way people identify race and ethnicity in the US is based on stereotypes of how people of various races look. 

Going deeper, I visited an ENT doctor a few years ago who commented on my torus palatinus. I said ""Yes, I am (tribe)."" He had no idea that palatal tori are common in Native populations, moreso than in European populations. Yet he worked at a teaching hospital and was responsible for educting future doctors.

In terms of physical markers in someone who is mixed Native and other, I just don't think your average town coroner or ME could accurately determine that based on appearance. This is why I am suspicious of that identification, I think it's probably based on stereotyping. especially the bit about the hair- forensic hair identification is notoriously poor science.

It's not his fault that he has ADHD, but it is his choice to refuse coaching, to lie all the time, go off his meds and lie about that for a year, etc. 

I've begged him to go to counseling and to get coaching. IN fact it was a condition of us staying together. He said he was going to counseling for awhile, but I'm not sure I believe him. He alway said he was going to get coaching but kept not doing so, so I can't believe that either.

4152,"&gt;I wouldn't say ""delusional"" because as far as he's concerned it's real

Yes, that is the case with most delusions. 

Here's a major way he is emotionally abusive: he is very avoidant, and lately whenever there is a situation that he wants to avoid dealing with, anything that stresses him out, he lashes out at me and blames me for whatever it is, even if I wasn't involved. I used to find this truly bewildering, and try to work out what was the problem, but now I realize it's just an abuse tactic to try to distract me from the real issue happening and to try to pressure me into dealing with the problem he ought to be handling. 

He also became very controlling. Eventually I stopped going out with friends, going dancing, doing anything social, having hobbies, because he would complain nonstop about all of those things. He wants to be the center of my attention, but that often meant me sitting in the living room alone while he played on his iPad in bed. If we went out socially and I did not stay glued to his side, make him the center of my attention, and ""shield"" him socially, I would hear about it when we got back home. He would give me the silent treatment, sometimes for days (he still does this, but now I don't let it upset me and that really bothers him.) He became convinced that I was ""hiding things"" from him (which was probably also projection, as he was hiding numerous infidelities from me.) He complained because I didn't have a job, but then sabotaged my job hunt by deleting voicemails from potential employers who wanted me to interview. 

He has for years had problems with impulsive and compulsive spending, but he refuses to budget or plan spending, and blames me for his financial problems. He would spend and spend (with me saying all the time ""Can we really afford this? Shouldn't we not dine out so much?"" ""We don't really need that expensive thing"") and then when a crisis hit he would have a screaming fit and blame me for the situation. 

He also lies constantly and engages in infidelity.",2016-04-14 21:32:37+00:00,d235py1,2.0,t1_d22kohi,26419.0,ADHD

This is crazy talk because 1, I didn't choose this house. I was specifically opposed to this house; he bought this house that he chose because he loved it. 2, he bought during the slump and his house note altogether is less than it would cost him to rent an apartment now. 3, Because he bought this too-big house he has always had a housemate covering part of the expenses and right now between myself and the housemate we cover the entire house note.

During the time he was of his meds, he: got 3 months behind on the mortgage and his car, went into arrears on his student loans, insisted he wasn't overspending, had our utilities cut off more than once because he forgot to pay (he did have the money, he just didn't pay it) come close to poisoning me several times, made our cat sick repeatedly by giving her food she's allergic to or by forgetting to give her medication, had three infected skin abscesses because of his hygiene, and SO MUCH other stuff . . . and through all that he STILL stayed off his meds.

Your MIL is annoying, but I think you and your DH can train her to be better-behaved and less annoying to you. Setting boundaries and enforcing them is a good start. 

It might help also to remember that your MIL is trying to connect with you and your DH. It's possible that she buys his clothes and mimics his preferences, etc, not to be malicious, but because she loves him in her way and wants to connect with him and just doesn't know how. I know this doesn't make her actions less annoying, but it might help you to blow them off and not take them personally if you think about it that way. If you can blow off the minor things she does, that will make the really asinine things less annoying too because your overall annoyance load will be smaller.

4232,"To expand upon this a little bit: the idea that the poor white soldiers of the confederacy were fighting ""for home and state"" is actually a myth created by the post-Reconstruction South. It is part of a general myth about the war of secession, which includes the beliefs that:

- the war was not about slavery, but states' rights/taxes/industry vs agriculture/whatever BS story. 
- most white people didn't have slaves and were not fighting for slavery, but out of loyalty to home and state

In reality, it's a little more complicated: the war was not abt slavery, but secession was about slavery and the war was about secession, so slavery was an indirect cause. Most poor white people who did not have slaves did not give a shit about the war. They saw, correctly, that the war did not serve their interests. 

The leaders of the CSA, however, expected that the poor whites would immediately join up out of loyalty or obligation or a stupid sense that they ought to support the rich folks. When that didn't happen, they instituted a draft. The draft was unpopular, especially after the CSA amended the draft law to exempt anyone who owned 20 or more slaves.

4245,"I believe you. I did not say your husband is a rapist. What I said was that he has a rapist's attitude. He believes he is entitled to sex with you whenever he wants it, because he wants it. That is what rapists believe. 

I believe you when you say he has not been violent, but rape is not always violent. This is a myth we have been taught- that it's only rape if someone is violent, hitting or using a weapon. This is not true. Rape happens when someone does not accept another person's no. 

When you say ""no"", even if it's a ""weak no"", and he keeps pushing, he is not respecting or accepting your consent. That is what rapists do. That is actually how most rapes happen! No means no, even if it's a ""weak no"". You do not have to yell or be ""strong"" in order for your ""no"" to ""count"" and be respected.

If he gains your consent through harassing you, that is consent under duress. It's not true consent, it is consent gained through fear. When he does that, he is not respecting your consent. Fundamentally, he does not respect or acknowledge your right to consent or not consent. 

What your husband does is called sexual coercion and in many cases, it is rape. Consent obtained under duress is not true consent.

&gt;I would never have married a man that I thought was capable of raping me or sexually abusing my kids. 

Of course you wouldn't have! I do not doubt that for a minute. You are obviously a caring mother and you did not marry this man seeking abuse. No one marries a man who she thinks will rape her or sexually abuse their children! Prison interviews with abusers show that they are very crafty with hiding their abusive intentions. They actively refrain from abusing their victims until they believe their victims are unable to leave. They rationalize the abuse, saying that they ""can't control themselves"" or blaming the victim; they tell the victims that ""if you did what you are supposed to, I wouldn't have to do this."" Sound familiar? 

Sexual abusers in particular admit that they target people who have been abused before, because they know that abuse survivors can be more vulnerable or feel unsafe setting sexual boundaries. 

I am sure you would never have married your husband if you had known he was an abuser, but he worked to hide his true nature from you. 

You are the only person who gets to decide if what your husband has done to you is rape. You get to define your experiences. Regardless of whether or not you were raped, your husband has abused you sexually and emotionally by coercing you. ",2016-04-07 20:17:14+00:00,d1u0ezj,3.0,t1_d1tx9pe,3958.0,DeadBedrooms

I had an ex who disregarded my pleasure during sex, who had poor hygiene, and who acted like a child most of the time, and who constantly pressured me for sex at all times, including when it was painful or dangerous to me. He also constantly pushed my sexual boundaries. And as a result I lost all desire for him and I also cringed when he touched me. I began to find him repulsive. There is no ""should"" here, because it is perfectly natural to not want to have sex with someone who is cruel to you. People, in general, want to have sex with people who treat them nicely. 

Your husband is the one who tanked your sex life, it isn't your problem to fix and I am glad you are getting out. 

Your husband has a rapist's attitude: the fact that you are there and he wants to have sex with you means that you owe him sex.

He is actually doing *exactly the same thing* that his mother does. He is withholding information and outright lying in order to control a situation and get his way.

No. The OP alone gets to decide what she ""has"" to do. She is not obligated to try to serve as a therapist for her husband, or to re-parent him, or to tolerate his abusive behavior.

Why else would there be a waiting period between application and effectiveness? Physical sunscreens do not need a waiting period for the opposite reason: they are reflective rather than absorptive.

A sunscreen with a chemical AND physical ingredients is the best bet.

No, 2 peas is not enough for your face. If a sunscreen is thicker, I use about a teaspoon for my face and neck and decolette. If it is a thin, very liquid sunscreen, I will use about a dime or nickel-sized amount.

My advice on application: rub it ON, not IN. Basically I use my fingers to lightly skim it, evenly, across the surface of my skin and then I let it soak in and bond on its own. Do not ""rub it in"" until you can't feel it, that is just stressing the ingredients and causes microexfoliation. ",2016-03-30 19:18:56+00:00,d1jg5tb,1.0,t3_4cip0o,62941.0,SkincareAddiction

&gt;I am sorry I am struggling to understand why he wasn't immediately suspect #1

I suspect it was because he was a man and she was a single woman who had a career, who traveled frequently for work, and who was known to have *gone to a bar* (gasp!). The fact that her kids lived with their dad probably counted against her, too. 

She worked as a political consultant, but when she went missing the papers reported her as ""a socialite."" 

So I would say that the answer is ""sexism"". Her disappearance was not taken seriously and Collins was considered credible just because he was a white man. 

Collins said that she went out to a bar, and then came home saying she had met Captain Jay and was going on a trip with him. Did anyone else at the bar see or meet this captain? I doubt it. 

It seems obvious that Collins killed her, and the police completely botched the case. I feel sad for her daughters.

4473,"&gt;How many people either of us know can rattle that figure off from the tip of their tongues?

Anyone who was active in the GLBT community, or even paying attention to it, during the time in question would know that transition was very very difficult and expensive. Anyone active in the GLBT community today would know that transition surgeries continue to be expensive and that life after transition continues to be very difficult for many trans* people. 

It's not like this shit wasn't/isn't also covered, although sensationally, by mainstream media. It was and is.

Here's an example of what I mean by ""basic history"": on another thread, some people demanded that I provide a source when I said that pre-Roe vs. Wade, wealthy women were able to travel to places where abortion was legal, to have abortions. This is really basic history. It is not secret knowledge, it is not special knowledge. It is not something that only *I* know. 

It's also information that is very readily available on the internet. Everyone who is posting here on reddit has an absolute *wealth* of information at their fingertips.

To me it really is like someone demanding that I provide a source if I were to say that the 4th of July is a holiday because it's the day the US officially declared independence from the UK. It seems that the only reason people could avoid knowing these things is if they were willfully avoiding information.

It's also very strange to me that some people in this sub make comments positing really far-fetched ideas and no one demands a source, but I make a reasonable post referencing facts and immediately someone (like yourself) implies that I am just lying because I haven't supplied a source. This is ridiculous for a lot of reasons: one, what possible motive would I have for making shit up? Two, this is a casual discussion on reddit, it's not a fucking term paper. The idea that I am somehow *obligated* to provide a source to a rando on the internet (or else I  must be lying) is just crazy. If you're in a casual conversation at a dinner party, do you demand that people ""prove"" everything they say with a source? Do you accuse them of lying if they don't whip a reference guide out of their pocket? I am guessing no, but you feel totally cool doing that on reddit. 

In addition to implying that I am being untruthful, you are *actually* being untruthful when you claim that I named a specific figure and then described that figure as ""basic history."" ",2016-03-26 23:08:44+00:00,d1enpx3,9.0,t1_d1e7e1p,28876.0,UnresolvedMysteries

I do have a question for you: why do you expect your mom to ""explain"" the discrepancies in her story and her parents story?

Why didn't you expect your GPs and uncle to explain the discrepancies in *their* stories? It seems like you went straight to thinking your mom was in the wrong.

Because I know what trans women faced in the late 80s. I know that the series of surgeries required were very, very expensive, and had an extensive recovery time (surgical recovery times are much shorter today, in part because of changes in protocol and in part because of advances in surgery.) 

I know that the later someone waits in life to have surgery, the more expensive it is and the more interventions are necessary. And I know that at that time, in the US a doctor would not even approve said surgeries unless the patient had been ""living as the opposite gender"" full-time for 2 years. (And also at that time, gender surgery tourism had yet to rise.)

So we are talking about a series of very expensive surgeries. (Even today, the full set are so expensive that most people who can afford to have them at all, can't afford to have them all at once, they have to stretch them out.) Each one has a recovery time of a few months at least. During that time Boyd would have to not only pay for the surgeries, but also all of his living expenses during recovery. So let's say he would need at least a year, which is on the generous side.

Afterward, he would still have many ""stereotypically masculine"" features like hands and feet that would not change. He would still have facial hair (hair removal takes time, electrolysis was the only option at that time.) So he would still stand out and face difficulty in terms of his economic future. Trans women still had a hard time finding jobs in the late 80s and well into the 90s. 

Because he would be in his ""new life"", he would have no access to whatever connections and resources he used to make money before.

I don't know anything about his estate, I am responding to the scenario presented in the OP. 

&gt;We are talking about a man who had murdered someone already in his life . . . This fact shows that he already doesn't react, think, or behave like the average person.

No, it really doesn't. While serial killers tend to be on the quirky side, people who commit only a single ""crime of passion"" tend to be pretty average. History has shown us that the average person is capable of violence and enormous rationalization of violence. That's kind of scary for the average person to think about, though. 

The OP postulates that Boyd was so clever that he could successfully fake his own not just death but murder, as well as frame someone for it, and con many other people, but also so incredibly stupid that he would embark on this new life by unnecessarily faking his death, and without taking all the resources at his disposal. That he would just leave behind enormous wealth instead of putting it to use in some way.  Those two states contradict one another. 

&gt;If you can provide strong reasoning/logic as to how he could make such a rash decision as to murder his wife's lover and yet not be capable of making any other rash decisions,

Everyone is capable of rash decisions, but faking your murder, framing your friend, and running off without all of your resources is not a rash decision. It is an extensive plan, but one that does not make sense. ",2016-03-24 09:05:21+00:00,d1bkboj,5.0,t1_d1bj557,4629.0,UnresolvedMysteries

You are suggesting that he disappeared, moving into a life in which he would have needed a LOT of money and had no way to get it, without selling his house, his valuable memorabilia, without taking his own money with him, etc.

Most women I know like having people visit during the early stages of labor because those parts are pretty boring and they can go on for hours. 

My SIL knew that MIL was at the hospital, of course, but I am not sure if she knew MIL was listening at the door. I should add, btw, that I think people are blowing this up and getting the wrong idea, because I did not give enough info: essentially we went into the labor/delivery room a few at a time to visit until it was time to push. Then everyone except BIL and SIL's mom went out to the waiting room. MIL was just breathless with anticipation. So a little while later she got up (under the pretext of getting a drink, I think) and went back toward the room. She stood outside the door for just a little while, and then came back all smiles and told us she heard the baby crying. 

I also know that she was worried because the baby was in a little distress, the cord was wrapped around her and every time SIL had a contraction, we would lose the baby's heartbeat. I know, it's normal for the heart to slow, but hers would pause during each contraction. So they were giving SIL oxygen and there was some concern. Eventually they decided to speed her labor up in order to get niece out. 

MIL and SIL are very close, and MIL really loves her grandkids, so I think she was just concerned and it affected her impulse control (she has ADD, and so does my SO, and I have seen how stress cripples his impulse control). In this case I don't think SIL would have been upset even if she knew MIL was outside.

I had to cover for my grandparents and not let people know how dysfunctional they were, etc. So I suffered alone.

Then I met my SO, and eventually, it turned out that he has a lot of mental health problems. They emerged gradually over the years, and as time passed I felt like I had to cover for him so he wouldn't be embarrassed, so our friends wouldn't think poorly of him, etc. I enabled him a lot by swooping in to help him when he fucked things up. It didn't help that he *expected* it, he expected that when he created a crisis I would drop whatever *I* was doing and help him. 

It was so isolating. I couldn't tell anyone how painful his problems were for me, because I was trying to hide them from other people. And it meant that when I did lose patience, people would think that *I* was just being an asshole; they didn't know that I had a reason to lose patience, and that his issues were stressing me beyond belief. I started to feel really resentful, that basically I was carrying the weight of his secrets.

4591,"Have you tried speaking with a child therapist or something who can help your husband to see reason? Because the things your MIL-ish is doing are really bad or small children. They need boundaries and routines in order to feel safe and secure in their upbringing. So not feeding him, disrupting his routine, etc, are bad for him. 

I think you and your DH should see a therapist together, so that you can get more on the same page about parenting. It might help you reach some compromises. I know many, many couples who found out after kids came along that they had some different ideas of how to handle things, and therapy helped. 

The real problem here is not your MIL-ish, but your husband, because he is the one who is not compromising with you and not respecting your input. If I were you (and if you haven't done this already) I would present this to him as about the child, not about the MIL. What you think of *her* should be irrelevant, what matters is the kid. You should be prepared to try to find a place of compromise, too; your DH is not willing to go to supervised visits only, but you can set some boundaries.

So if I were you I would present to him the things you think your son needs in order to have a stable, happy life. If the kid is having problems in school or something, this could be presented as a solution. 

1- visits only on weekend, home before 6 o'clock on school nights.

2- No more calling her ""mama"". If you want to see how confusing that can be to a little kid, ask /u/kateraide .

3- No more crying and hysterics when she drops him off. This is emotionally confusing to him.

4- Boundaries. She needs to respect your authority as his parents. So no telling him he can do things you say he cannot.

The thing is, you and your husband have to agree to some boundaries and then your DH has to back you up. There have to be consequences, like if she cries when she drops him off, she doesn't get to take him to her house next time. Etc. 

I also think it would be a good idea, if you have not already, to invite her over to visit at your house. That means she can see your son more often, which might make her less emotionally fraught when she drops him off, less clingy when he is visiting her, etc. It also gives you and your husband a chance to see how she interacts with your son, so you can get a better idea of how she treats him. It also means that if she starts acting uber-crazy you can have some examples to point to when you talk to your husband.

If your husband is not going to respect you and also parent his child in this, at some point I think things will get worse and you will have to ask yourself harder questions. Good luck!",2016-03-21 23:16:42+00:00,d18h3qx,1.0,t3_4belzs,3374.0,JUSTNOMIL

In my case the ""homeless lifestyle"" was awful, scary, and stressful. I never had enough to eat. I was in high school, so I could not work full-time, but I had a part time job. Minimum wage was something ridiculous like $4.25. Before I turned 18, I couldn't have a lease; after I turned 18, I still couldn't afford an apartment by myself; I tried a few times with roommates but they would usually flake out. I had no skills at telling sketchy people from non-sketchy people at that time. 

Sometimes high school friends could sneak me into their houses for an overnight sleep and a shower, but not always. When I couldn't find a place to sleep at night, I would go to a diner and order coffee all night to keep me awake. I was a teen girl so I was really scared of actually sleeping on the street. 

During the day I would nap in a storage closet at my high school.

4659,"Yes, I am familiar with the autopsy. (where do you think I got the information about JB's head injury?)  Yes, it was a skull fracture. Yes, it would have been fatal on its own *if it were untreated*. 

But if it were treated, she would have been fine. Especially as young as she was: the brain is still very plastic. There is no reason to believe that her parents would have murdered her to hide the fact that Burke hit her in the head.

After the autopsy, tests showed that in order to create the kind of head injury she had, she would have had to have been hit by someone very strong, which also makes Burke unlikely. 

Yes, different head injuries are different. But the kind of skull fracture my sister had is actually very similar to the one JB had, except it was *worse*. She was actually hit in the head with a baseball bat (which is what some investigators think JB was hit with.)  If she had not had surgery, she would have died. 

Even with the surgery, the doctor said 50% chance of survival. She did survive, and recovered. She was paralyzed on one side of her body for awhile (she was hit on the right side, so she was paralyzed on the left) but gradually that went away. She has a plate in her head. A child of JB's age would probably not have had a plate, because she was still growing; she would have had to wear a helmet until her skull stopped growing, then they would have installed a plate. 

Incidentally, JB's autopsy says she had no injury to the scalp. The scalp was not broken by the blow. My sister was hit hard enough, deep enough, to tear her scalp. Her brain injury was worse than JB's, but she survived because she had surgery. 

I actually didn't know until reading the autopsy that JB's skull fracture was so similar to my sister's, but now I am sure that it would not have been fatal if she had been treated. ",2016-03-19 20:38:34+00:00,d160c13,,t1_d15yqbh,2937.0,UnresolvedMysteries

Nicholas was a violent teen because his family had been violent toward him his whole life. When Jason came to live there to ""discipline"" him, that meant to bully and beat him into submission. 

I think that Nicholas's mom probably knows, deep in her heart, that Jason killed him, but she spent years in denial. She avoided the blood test and etc because she wanted to maintain that denial. She felt guilty because she brought Jason home and put him in charge, she wanted very badly to have her son back, so when Bourdin showed up she wanted to believe so badly, she convinced herself it was true.

Sebum glands express antioxidants in sebum. This is how sebum protects our skin from sun damage. (Antioxidants are proven to protect and repair sun damage when applied topically.) 

The Vitamin D in sebum comes OUT of the skin, and for a reason. 

I suspect that the reason these surfers in Hawaii had similar to lower Vitamin D levels, compared to the African hunter-gatherers, was dietary. Hunter-gatherers are eating animals who eat forage, and animals who eat forage have higher levels of Vitamin D in their fat than do animals who eat a corn-based industrial diet. Hawaiian surfers, on the other hand, are probably eating the standard american diet, which is low in Vitamin D and generally crap.

It doesn't mean that it's wrong when a woman wants the input of the potential father, or any one else she chooses to consult. But it means that you are the ultimate decider, because you have to bear the pregnancy if you decide to do that. ",2016-03-14 23:06:33+00:00,d0zy5k7,13.0,t1_d0zvl75,3895.0,JUSTNOMIL

- When my DH moved cities to live with me, she got really pissed off about that. And for some reason she was pissed at me instead of him, even though really she had nothing to be angry about. But his family is avoidant, so instead of dealing with her shit, she was passive-aggressive toward me for a few years. 

- My DH is avoidant too, so the problem on his end is that he just will. not. stand up for me or try to fix things.

- I have a severe chronic illness  that means what I can eat is somewhat limited, and she was nice about it at first, but over the years she has become increasingly rude about it. 

- She's just inconsiderate. I get that she doesn't mean to be, but does that matter? If I or DH tell you nine times that your air freshener makes me sick, and you keep spraying that shit, it stops mattering. 

- But at the bottom of most things is that my DH is avoidant and terrified to rock the boat. So his family knows nothing about our real life, and he doesn't want me to ever tell them anything. (We are not of the same religion as his fam and that is supposed to be a secret. But our religious activities are a really big part of our life, but we can't talk about them, etc.) So after two Christmases whereat I was either ignored or peppered with veiled insults, I decided to stay home. 

When his mom asked why I didn't come for Christmas, he told them I was going to spend it with my family, which is not true. It really felt like a slap in the face because not only does it show that he's not going to ever deal with shit, but he also expected me to back up his lie, which I do not like. 

We are all getting older: his mom is getting cranky and may be sliding into dementia, so she is more rude. I am getting fed up and no longer willing to put up with her shit.

4770,"I think there's a LOT wrong with your MIL. But, you're right that she is, in her way, trying to connect with you and doing it really badly. My biomom does this- even when she means well, and is trying to say something nice, she says it in a really terribly annoying way. Like, one of our pets died and my boyfriend was really upset. She said ""Well, you shouldn't let yourself feel bad about it, you could make yourself sick."" 

Years later I realized that this is the best she can do. She does not know how to relate to other people, because she is very narcissistic. So this was her version of trying to connect, but it was still awful and it enraged him. 

It's good that you can recognize that you are touchy about advice, and that advice feels like criticism to you. It would be good for you to work on that regardless (lol look, I'm giving advice hahahaha) because it will make your life easier later on. But I also think that you might not feel so criticized by her advice if she wasn't so shitty to you all the time. 

The whole moving in with you, taking advantage, feeding your dog, etc: that's a separate issue. She fundamentally does not respect you. That's totally different from failing to connect and imo it's a much bigger deal. 

WRT the unwanted advice- you say she needs you to know she's intelligent. But based on how you have described your discussions, I think you want HER to know, too, about you. YOu can opt out of these conversations. You don't have to argue with her. She is insecure, so when you say ""No, I'm gonna do it this way,"" she feels like she has to justify why she does it her way. 

So next time you are doing something your way, and she says ""You can do that this way, it's better,"" practice saying ""That's a good idea"" or ""Thanks for that information"" or ""I'll consider that"" and then just go on doing whatever you are doing.

I just started using EpiCeram for AD on my face. So I put that on first. I find that the EpiCeram is actually drying, so I add a drop of oil to it. I let the EpiCeram soak in for about 10 minutes, then I apply the tret. Once the tret has soaked in, I spray my face with a little water, apply a face oil, then let that soak in, and apply Cerave cream. 

I keep a tube of Aquaphor by my bed, right before I go to sleep I seal the whole thing with the Aquaphor. This may seem extreme but I have AD on my face and it has become very, very dry. This is the night routine that works for me in terms of keeping it hydrated. 

On my off nights I do use a BHA, I use PC calming 2% BHA. 

I actually started tret just once a week, did that for a month, then went up to 2x week. I did not add the BHA until a month or so after I went up to 2xweek with tret.

I only use tret twice a week. I worked my way up to twice a week and when I went to every 3 days, my skin became very dry and irritated. So back down to twice a week. It's definitely had an effect that I like. There is ample research showing that twice a week is effective.

I also use a low dose, .025%. Research shows that a low dose is almost as effective as a high dose, but less irritating. 

In this way I have had no peeling, very little irritation, and no major breakout. I had a tiny bit of flaking in my second month, just around my nose, but it's gone. I do moisturize a LOT. I layer moisturizers under and over my tret cream. 

Tret has improved the condition of my melasma, and at this current 2xweek use rate, it's made my skin more hydrated (because it absorbs moisture better), softer, more radiant. So yes, to me it's worth it. But at every 3rd day, it wasn't ""worth it"", because it was so drying and irritating! I am probably going to try every 3 days again in the summer, when my skin is typically more oily and hydrated.

It is a MYTH that you have to use tret every night, or that you will be stuck using it for the rest of your life. I have read accounts by people who only use it during the winter, for example, because they spend a lot of time outdoors during the summer.

Every time someone posts a ""Burke did it"" post, it turns out that the person isn't very informed about the case.

I get the idea that you want to build a bridge between your wife and your MIL. I think your intentions are good and I don't have the impression that you are looking for slave labor.

My mom routinely left me in the care of less-than-stellar caregivers, including my grandparents, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it literally scarred me. Until a grandchild is here, you don't know what kind of grandmother your MIL will be or if she would be a good caregiver, so I just don't think you can factor her into your plans. 

&gt;I suspect MIL frets and worries about everyone because she has so little to do

If she has little to do, keep in mind this is by choice. She could have friends, an active social life, volunteerism, etc, if she wanted those things. 

Fortunately many employers are doing more to support workers with families, so it's possible you will have a job with things like flex-time or on-site daycare by the time you have a child. ",2016-03-10 07:13:02+00:00,d0ugwqc,3.0,t1_d0u8c1v,15776.0,JUSTNOMIL

What helped me to make that choice was imagining, not just a baby, but a child growing older and older and eventually becoming an adult. I realized what a huge commitment of my life it would be, and also how difficult. I thought about all the things they put you through, how the fantasy is never the same as the reality, all the ways that parenting is really hard. 

I also took into account that people who don't have children report higher levels of life satisfaction, and have happier marriages. And, I reached out to older childfree women I respected to ask them how they felt about their choice not to have kids. None of them reported any regrets.

4978,"Ok, I just looked at your photo. It looks like you have a case of rhinophyma on your nose. This is related to testosterone. Rhinophyma IS treatable though. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinophyma

In your shoes I would start using a 2% bha on your nose every day, then move up to twice a day. You will need to give this a lot of time. Rhinophyma thickens the skin on your nose, so essentially you have very deep pores and it is hard to get them cleared out. Be aware that I am talking about months or years of time. 

The bumps you are talking about are a combination of thickened skin, and pimples deep under the surface. You might benefit from occasional peels. 

You could also try Paula's Choice 9% bha and use that on your nose only at night. I suggest following it with a gentle moisturizer. Wear sunscreen every day. 

If all else fails, rhinophyma is also treated with surgery to remove the excess, thickened skin on the nose. 

Rhinophyma is a type of rosacea. YES, you will have it for the rest of your life. But it's treatable, and it doesn't mean your nose will look like it does now, for the rest of your life. With treatment you can have a lot of improvement.

Frankly, I would need more than ""a day to adjust to the change in plans."" Yeah, it's your major and your career, but it was sudden for him and he was planning to move to the other city. The fact that he has lived in that town before is irrelevant. It doesn't mean he wants to live there. 

Wasn't he living with his parent while y'all were long distance? It actually makes sense for him to stop arguing with her if that was the case.

4980,"Yes. So as I see it, Casey wasn't remotely a party animal.

4981,"What I see is a dysfunctional family dynamic. 

Cindy may seem domineering, and maybe she is domineering. But a pattern I have seen in many relationships is that one party is incompetent or unwilling to be responsible, and then the other party ends up taking on more and more responsibility. At that point the other party appears to be domineering, but in reality they resent the fact that their input and work is required in every decision. 

So it's possible that CIndy is actually domineering, but it's also possible that George is irresponsible and over the years Cindy has had to take on more and more responsibility. In a situation like that, the responsible party feels anxious, overwhelmed, and may appear domineering.

Casey then gets put in the middle of this. I am sure this isn't the first time George has blamed her for something he did or didn't do. 

Just FYI, emotional or psychological abuse IS abuse, and it also qualifies as abuse under the law. 

&gt;He's saying all these things and basically agreeing with everything the police say about Casey, trying to get the police to like him.

I don't see it that way. I see him as worried that their suspicion will fall on him, so he's trying to keep it focused on Casey. That isn't the same as Casey saying ""I can't go out because I have to stay home with my daughter,"" when she really wanted to stay home with her daughter. 

It appears that you see all deflection or dishonesty as the same, but when you consider context, they are not the same. ",2016-03-05 01:29:07+00:00,d0o2mp1,3.0,t1_d0o1zfe,1184.0,UnresolvedMysteries
4982,"&gt;When it comes to the argument that somehow this is evidence that Casey was being held back by her child…how do you distinguish ""motive"" from simply being a good mother? Because wouldn’t a good mother have the same pre-death profile? Wouldn't a good mother turn her friends down to stay home with her child?

This is an example of the double standard to which women are subjected. If Casey had been out ""partying"" every night before Caylee died, well, that would be ""evidence"" that she was a bad mother and wanted to get rid of her child. Since Casey wasn't out partying every night before Caylee died, that's ""evidence"" that she's a bad mother who wanted to get rid of her child.

One possibility that I didn't notice covered here is that Casey may have used Caylee as an excuse not to go out with people. If Casey was uncomfortable saying no, Caylee was a great excuse. My own mother did this when I was a kid- if a guy wanted her to go out, or wanted to come over, and she wasn't interested, she would tell him that she couldn't because I was there or she had no babysitter, etc. 

It wasn't just helpful in terms of making excuses or avoiding saying no. It was a way to let a guy down easy and avoid dealing with his anger, and the possibility of violence, while still looking virtuous. Once a friend of my uncle's hit on her in a really, really creepy way, right in front of me, and she was obviously shaken up. But we were in a situation where she didn't feel safe just turning him down. So she said ""I don't do that with my child here.""

4983,"&gt;There’s no telling what Casey’s motivation was, but it sounds like she had a real issue with telling Amy no.

The more you writ about Casey and her life, the more I believe that she was a victim of abuse. 

This behavior- the inability to say no, the frequent behavior changes to appease another person or ""win"" their love- are typical of abuse survivors who have not dealt with their abuse. 

This looks to me like a person who was punished whenever she said no or tried to set any boundary. If from her very earliest childhood, saying no or doing anything other than pleasing others led to trauma, fear, and punishment, she could become pathologically afraid of saying no to people. So she puts off refusal til the last possible moment. ",2016-03-05 00:45:19+00:00,d0o17f3,1.0,t3_48ytu5,19384.0,UnresolvedMysteries

Often these reactions are not strictly allergic, but involve mast cells. 

I recommend the Cerave as a start because it's highly moisturizing and because studies have shown that AD skin is deficient in ceramides. You should definitely be getting ceramides onto your skin. The Cerave lotion just doesn't have enough, imo, but the Cerave in the cream really made a difference in my AD.

BHA

hydrating serum

oil

Cerave

Aquaphor

During the day I layer

Hydrating serum (Josie Maran Argan Milk)

Oil under eye area and on upper cheek area (I use passion fruit seed oil for this, I love it) 

Cerave cream on neck

Once those have had 5-10 minute to soak in, I blot off the excess oil that hasn't absorbed, and then put on my sunscreen. I used to use EltaMD, but I am too dry for it right now, so I have been using Josie Maran SPF47. It is very moisturizing and has made a difference for me.

I still sometimes wonder why people do mean things. Like sometimes I get really reactive and find myself really wracking my brain (I also came from a very abusive and neglectful childhood.) 

We do it, maybe, because they have convinced us early on that they did the abusive thing because of something we did.

A part of our brain tells us that if we can find the reason, we can make it stop. (Because it's always the victim's job to fix the situation.)

It's hard for white people to talk about privilege sometimes, because they feel like it's an indictment of them *personally*, when really, this is a model used to talk about how some groups are privileged over others. 

This is actually a good essay about poor people and white privilege. You might find it helpful. Having WP does not mean you aren't underprivileged or oppressed in other ways, it just means you are privileged in this one way.

Your family are farmers. Imo that's a noble profession. But your family has a farm *because* of the genocide and displacement of Native Americans. That's one way have benefited from privilege.

What it means to acknowledge privilege is *not* to deny it. It means acknowledging that privilege is real, and to reflect on the ways it has affected your life.

Then why do so many of them deny it? Seriously, if all white people acknowledged their privilege, ""acknowledging privilege"" wouldn't even be a thing. In fact lots of white people, maybe most of them, don't acknowledge WP. Instead they deny and derail. They usually get defensive whenever WP is brought up.

If the OP really wants to build a case that people are picking on them for their disability, it is a wise idea to document every interaction (date, time, who involved) in which the OP feels mocked, and then maybe bounce that off an uninvolved 3rd party before going to hr the OP's boss.

I'm not saying that the OP is not being picked on, but I am saying that the onus will be on the OP to document it, and that there will be people looking for any mistake on the OP's part.

A long time ago I had a job where I was one of a group of assistants. Some people in our department started complaining that the assistants didn't do anything, blah blah. I should add that we were heavily understaffed and underpaid.

Incidentally, the organization was a nonprofit and was being audited by a grantor. So for a month, we were required to log everything we did and which grant it was funded by, in 15-minute increments, all day. 

It turned out that the assistants did a LOT. IN fact our department head said we did more tasks per day than the MSWs we were assisting. So she suggested that we should keep logging our work every day. This came in really handy for me later when people wanted to question my productivity.

5167,"&gt;Why does she send the four year old girl home across the street on her own? 

When I was 4, I was allowed to walk down the street (about 5 houses on big lots) by myself, as well as across the street. Kids also rode their bikes all around the neighborhood without supervision. So this doesn't seem at all unusual to me. The idea that children must have an adult watching them at all times is fairly new and imo unhealthy. Look into the free range kids movement if you want to know more. 

&gt;For one, would a four year old mistake blood for red paint

If the first place she saw it was on the wall, yeah. I mean, if you are 4 years old, you only know what you know. So imagine you've never seen an injury in which someone bled a lot, onto the floor and the wall. I think that if a small child saw red smears on the wall and floor, she might assume paint. 

The lots in this neighborhood, where the house was (it's gone now) are quite large. WHen Barb saw Joan by the car, she might have been looking out her window or something, distracted, etc. It's not like in a tight urban area where across the street is just a few feet away. But it's also possible that when Barn saw Joan by the car, she didn't think it was a big deal, but that later on in light of the disappearance she decided that Joan had looked dazed. 

Also speaking as someone with younger siblings: when a baby is crying, one of the first things you do is check to see if it's wet. I suspect that Lillian had been trained in this herself- the baby is crying, is he wet? 

People in small towns often leave their doors unlocked (my MIL still does this and it drives my partner nuts) and so I think your intruder theory is right. Someone could have been waiting quietly in the house. ",2016-02-24 00:00:13+00:00,d0ba13f,2.0,t1_d0927np,146043.0,UnresolvedMysteries

5171,"&gt;isn't there the slightest concern that there are people who could be falsely claiming this culture in order to make a bunch of money off of casinos

Yes, there is concern about this. However, the idea that people are ""making a bunch of money"" is generally false. That's a big misconception about Indian gaming. The main concern, as far as I am concerned, is that non-Indian people are often appropriating our culture for profit. 

&gt;someone like Hayward had a massive financial incentive to suddenly find his long lost culture

No, he didn't. That's the way the article is spinning this, but it just isn't true (the article is biased and the headline on this TIL is 20 years out of date.) Hayward moved home and started litigating in the mid-70s. He also started farming on the land and encouraging his relatives to move home. Casinos weren't even an option at this time, the Indian Gaming Act wasn't passed until 1988. The Pequot had a 7-year legal battle to restore federal recognition. That COSTS money. 

The Pequot didn't open a casino until 1992. Before they all they had was a bingo hall. 

Furthermore, it was not his ""long lost culture"" (and your automatic assumption that it was is based on racist ideas about Natives.) He spent his childhood on that rez, as did many other Pequot before they were forced by poverty to move elsewhere. Elizabeth George was his grandma. He didn't just suddenly pop up and say ""I'm an Indian!"" he had an immediate family connection to the land and his culture. 

&gt;Do other Native American tribes or committees do any sort of vetting on their side?

Are you asking if other Nations are ""vetting"" the legitimacy of the Pequot? The answer is ""no"". We have no reason to do so. We have our own business to mind. The only time a Nation would try to interfere with the recognition or sovereignty of another Nation would be when our own is threatened. 

Benedict's book, which is treated as an unquestioned authority in this article, has actually been criticized very strongly by anthropologists and historians. 

The quote you found is clearly biased. It's full of yellow journalism. 

""insider machinations""

""tribe"" in quotes

""the fix was in""

""No one even raised the issue of whether the Pequots were actually a real Indian tribe."" Because there are hundreds of years of documentation that they are a real Indian tribe, why would anyone ""raise"" a nonexistent issue?

""Hayward’s lack of credentials as chief were never questioned"" What lack of credentials?

5190,"&gt; tribes who have been in operation for decades seem to struggle with receiving federal recognition 

Decades? Don't you mean centuries?

Tribes out there struggling because of a lack of federal recognition, it is probably because they were terminated. Like I said, it is in the fed's interest to declare a people to be ""extinct"". So for awhile the fed was pursuing a policy of termination: they would declare that a tribe had small enough numbers that they should no longer be considered a tribe, declare them terminated, and then cancel all of their treaty rights. Even before that they would sometimes take two tribes who had been decimated by disease and forcibly combine them; they would declare the smaller tribe extinct and tell them all ""You're now part of this bigger tribe."" 

Many of these groups have continued fighting for re-recognition. Maybe if they had some wealthy neighbors on illegally purchased land to sue, they would have it by now! But in many cases these tribes are opposed by wealthy lobbyists, for example Donald Trump has paid lobbyists to oppose recognition before, because he doesn't want the competition from Indian casinos. Small groups of Indians typically cannot afford to compete on that scale, so they have to keep plugging along. It is why a lot of Indians who go to college feel obligated to study law or political science.

If it seems strange to you that systematic racism keeps POC from having their rights, that's really sweet and I hope you won't lose that beautiful spirit. It's just life for us.

5203,"Yes, I read that part. It's meaningless. 

It says ""he claims"" but doesn't verify those claims, so it means nothing. People can claim anything. 

The fact that his grandmother may have had Narragansett ancestors doesn't mean she wasn't also Pequot. More importantly in this case, the federal government had designated her as Pequot. This isn't unusual; small tribes are often lumped in with larger ones, or people who were incorrectly classified by Indian agents 100 years ago get stuck with that classification.

For example, the Eastern Delaware tribe was for awhile considered, legally, to be part of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. 

Records compiled by BIA agents are suspect because those agents usually didn't speak the Native languages, and based their classifications on really stupid racist ideas like head measurements and hairstyles. They also didn't take into account the fact that Native people had their own ways of identifying and determining someone's community. 

Having Narragansett ancestors does not disqualify her from being Pequot. The Narragansett and the Pequot were intertwined communities- they powwow'd together for decades, and since you probably don't know, I will fill you in: powwows are where people look for spouses from other communities. Lots of Mohegans and Narragansetts have Pequot ancestors. 

For the purposes of the legality of Pequot recognition, what matters is not whether or not Ms. George had Narragansett ancestors, but how she was recognized by the federal government. In 1900, she was 6 years old and the federal government enrolled her as Pequot. 

I am guessing this isn't your area of expertise. It *is* my area of expertise. This is in fact my life. 

What I do think is messed up is that the George family descendants have basically conspired to exclude or disenroll Pequot people who are not their immediate relatives. That is a very sad trend in Indian country today. ",2016-02-23 05:05:40+00:00,d0a9oou,3.0,t1_d0a4770,9000.0,todayilearned

Also, the DSM does actually include amphetamine-induced bipolar disorder and amphetamine-induced psychosis.

I have been in therapy off and on for years and my therapists have all assured me that I am not a N. I've also done check-ins with the people in my life. 

Creative people tend to relate with others by talking about an experience or feeling *they* (we) had in response to a friend sharing theirs. This may seem narcissistic, but it's not, because it is rooted in empathy and connection.  

Also, one can be somewhat narcissistic in the colloquial sense, or even self-centered, but not have narcissistic personality disorder.

More importantly: It sounds to me like your friend has some flea and is possibly an enabler. Talking about how you were abused, and how that makes you feel, is not remotely the same thing as abusing someone. I think your friend was way out of line and I think you should call them on that. 

Some people blame abuse victims for their abuse by saying things like your friend said. They say that because there are two people in the situation, both people are equally responsible or to blame. Or they say that being angry about being abused is ""just as bad"" as the original abuse. *This is not true.* It is victim-blaming and undermining and it is not okay.

In your shoes I would say to my friend ""It hurt my feelings when you implied that in expressing my hurt and upset about the way my parents abused me, I am acting just as they did. Being upset because someone abused you is not even close to the same as actually abusing someone. Your words were invalidating and hurtful."" 

Then see what your friend says. If they say ""I didn't realize that, but now I do and I am sorry,"" then maybe things can continue. But if they argue with you, try to convince you that you are wrong, continue to insist that being angry at your parents is the same as the way your parents abused you, then I think you need to end this friendship for your own protection.

Your assertion that it's hard to get emancipated, that the OP would have to pay for an attorney, that the OP has to already demonstrate financial self-sufficiency (directly contradicted by the passage you quoted) and be living separately from their parents. None of these things are true. 

For example, the passage you quoted mentions ""other living arrangements."" Living with their partner's family will qualify in the eyes of most judges, especially in a situation where the OP is so close to 18. 

The passage you quoted also says that the petitioner must demonstrate that they *can* be self-sufficient, not that they already are. 

It's discouraging misinformation like this that kept me from becoming emancipated when I should have, and that messed up my life in a lot of ways. 

Really, judges are human beings and whether the OP can get emancipated in current conditions depends entirely on the whim of the judge. 

I actually think that at this point, since the OP is so close to 18, they should go ahead and move in with their partner. It is unlikely that any judge will issue a warrant to have them returned to their parents, especially once the history of abuse is explained.

What a lot of people do not understand (because it's really not taught in schools) is that Black people in the US, especially the South, have for centuries been the victims of criminal conspiracies and institutionalized racism. Black people really *are* routinely murdered by LE and have been all this time, and it has routinely been covered up at every level. Black people (and other POC) have been particularly and specifically targeted for victimization using the law. So while it seems paranoid for them to think he was murdered, or that there has been a cover up, it really isn't. 

Until fairly recently in history, *entire towns did* collude in covering up the brutal murders of Black people. There are photographs of enormous crowds of people turning out for a lynching, yet no one was ever charged with murder, because there were never any witnesses. Government authorities (like LE, MEs and even the federal government) have conspired to kill and injure Black people (COINTELPRO, the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, for example.) 

In a world where large conspiracies to deny Black people their rights *is* the *actual reality* and has been for centuries, it isn't unreasonable for them to suspect that this is happening. It isn't even unreasonable for them to think that there has been a cover-up, that the authorities have ways of changing the evidence, because that has definitely happened.

Once my siblings were old enough to have their own cell phones and coordinate their own lives, I went very very LC. I have not seen my Nbiomom since 2009, when her brother died. During that time she asked me to go with her to his house to help her clean it out, but it would have meant being alone with her in the middle of nowhere, and so I did not do it. I would probably have done it if other people were coming along.

I am pretty much NC. Every once in awhile she calls me or sends me a message on FB, but it's been a year or so since she's even done that.

Here is what I actually said and if you have any questions about it I will answer them. 

""&gt;Parents are responsible for their children when they are little, not the other way around.""

This is a really uniquely western, white perspective. I mean, in all the world. Everywhere besides the west, families function in an attitude of mutual responsibility. And even this idea is really, really new to the west.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't believe what you want, but I think it's important to make room for non-white, non-western values, and not trump white and western values as though they are the correct ones and others are incorrect.

Non-white, non-westerner here: I do think that we should have a reciprocal responsibility to our parents. But I think that when our parents abdicate their part, that gives us the freedom to abdicate our part too. There are degrees of responsibility and contact, and I hope that the OP can find a happy medium that works for her.""

5449,"&gt;Unlike kids, parents have to earn it. The second half of your comment seems to indicate you agree with that at least to a degree.

Not entirely. I do not think they have to earn it- I think they have to lose it. 

&gt;even if the kid has never done a thing for them. 

I honestly think that basing familial relationships of any sort on what someone has or can do for you is an N-trait. It's how Ns see the world: what can you do for me? What have you done for me? What are you likely to do for me in the future? All relationships are transactional to them.

Mutual responsibility isn't about someone doing something for you. It's about connection and community and right living. I do not think that parents must earn a place, but that it should be granted to them automatically, until such time as they act in such a way that they lose it.

And what that means to the individual is up to them to work out. My Nbiomom is a vicious abuser who completely abandoned her responsibilities toward me, and so I have no responsibility toward her. But the OP might feel differently toward her mom, and that doesn't make her feelings or belief *wrong*, especially if the alternative is that an elderly woman with mental health problems becomes homeless/helpless. That prospect might not be bearable for the OP and I can see why.

To the OP I say: you might be responsible for your mom, if you believe you are. But being responsible for her doesn't mean you have to listen to her BS. I found that I had to ""train"" my Nbiomom over a series of years for better behavior. For about a year that meant swearing at her a LOT, which was unpleasant, but effective. For the years after that, I basically withdrew whenever she behaved badly. Rude on the phone? I would say ""Ok, if you're going to talk like that, I have to go. Bye!"" and get off the phone. Rude in person ""Ok, I think it's time for me to go home now."" It really worked wonders.

You can withdraw when your mom says racist things, or other abusive things. Being responsible for her might mean that you only make sure her basic life needs are covered, it doesn't mean you have to socialize with her at all.

It turns out that these days, I make friends pretty easily and tend to actually be pretty popular! But I'm always *surprised* when someone likes me. 

Plus I have accomplished quite a lot in my life, but I still feel like a loser sometimes because I haven't accomplished the ""mainstream expectations"" that it seems people are ""supposed"" to accomplish. I try to remind myself that I started from a different starting line than those people, and had obstacles they did not. 

In the case of this incident you describe at another gym, the ""problem"" was all in your insecurities. The trainer was not trying to ""pick on"" you, she was trying to help you, which to me sounds like a really good trainer! To her, you were a new person in her class and she was doing her job by helping you. Her actions say nothing about whether anyone likes you or not.  

Also, I should add that the fact you work in a gym and are training to be a PT really doesn't mean your form was right. I love Pilates, I've done Pilates mat for years, and I have found that when I go to a regular gym for a Pilates class, the trainers usually have no idea what they are doing or what we should be doing. Pilates is a very specific discipline, and being a PT or working in a gym doesn't qualify anyone to teach it, or mean that they understand it. I am always working on my form, every day, because part of the point of Pilates *is* to focus your mind on your form and what you are doing with your muscles. 

I suspect that if she cared enough about your form to correct it she probably knows more about it than you do. And it is *okay* to know less about something than someone else does. It's normal and natural, and it's actually a great opportunity for you, because you can learn something!

Growing up with an Nparent who constantly criticized me made me very sensitive about getting things wrong. I found it very embarrassing. So when I was very young, I found any situation where I did something incorrectly to be extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing and upsetting. That's an effect of N-parents that you have to get over. It will cripple you socially and professionally. It might be part of why you are making a bad impression on people at work. If you are convinced that you already know all about whatever it is, and get upset when people introduce new information to you, people can tell and it will cause problems for you.

&gt;She can't hurt you if you don't let her, no matter what she does.

Victim blaming. The OP is a teenager still under the legal control of an N. The N can definitely hurt the OP. There are people in this forum (me included) whose parents have been majorly violent.

If you ask a professional though, they will tell you it's just not the case. I mean, think about all the reports of hoarder houses stacked with piles of newspapers: that's not a collection. 

So I would say that this is a very narrow view of hoarding, and probably attached to the old belief that hoarding was a form of OCD. The most recent research we have says that hoarding is not like OCD in the brain, instead it is related to difficulties in prioritizing tasks and objects, as well as attachment to them. 

IN fact my partner does have a collection of things and is attached to those, but that stuff is much less of a problem than the garbage. ",2016-02-04 20:42:52+00:00,cznzal5,2.0,t1_cznn761,16540.0,hoarding

If the pictures were suggestive or inappropriate, it would be acceptable for your parents to speak to you and express their concerns about the photo and its possible consequences for you professionally or socially. It would not ever be justified for them to demand or order you to take the picture down.

5643,"What is interesting is that when people who have committed crimes and been remitted to institutions due to mental illness are asked about how their mental illness related to their crimes, most of them will report that their mental illness was not the cause of their crime. But they will say that alcohol use played a big part, and most of their records support this. 

So yeah, mental illness probably *played a part*, but the greater cause is usually substance abuse. Sometimes the substance abuse is a result of mental illness; a lot of people with mental illness or mood disorders self-medicate with alcohol or non-prescribed drugs. 

A lot of them report anger or poverty as causes as well, which is also interesting. Poverty (that is, all the choices and thoughts necessary to survive in poverty) takes up a lot of brain capacity, limiting your ability to make sound decisions and control impulses. 

There is a weird trend in the US to assume or insist that anyone who commits an especially violent crime *must* be mentally ill, especially if they are white or not poor. 

In fact people with mental illness are typically much more likely to be a victim of violent crime than they are to be a perpetrator. The idea that mental illness causes violent crime is a belief based on prejudice, not on science.

5651,"This might sound contradictory, but hear me out: the main reason I decided to really commit to tret (after years of having a rx but not using it because scaling up seemed like a nightmare and it was always irritating and drying when I tried it before). was because my skin was really, really dry and dehydrated. I would put on moisturizer and it would just sit on the top of my skin and not sink in. I have typically congested skin with slow turnover, and when it gets dry the congestion (and breakouts_ usually get worse. I figured that my skin was actually so dry that the top layer was ""sticking"" and preventing product from sinking into my skin. 

So I decided to really commit to tret in order to increase cell turnover, so that my skin could absorb moisturizers. 

It absolutely worked. I did not see many results using it once a week, but after just a week or so of moving up to twice a week, my skin began absorbing moisturizer again and was much more hydrated. 

The secret to me to getting it to work without making my skin red and flaky and sad was to scale up very slowly and not worry about planning a calendar for it (I was overthinking it) and also, using a heavy moisturizer *over* the tret once it had soaked in. Once I went up to 3x/week I began putting a light moisturizer underneath the tret too, which also helped prevent irritation.

I have melasma, and I had tried hydroquinone but it made the melasma darker. As a bonus, the tret started making my melasma look lighter just a few weeks after going to twice a week.

Have you tried BHA? I have pretty bad KP on my arms and physical exfoliation really didn't touch it. AHA lotion helped slightly, but BHAs are the real game-changers. 

Instead of a physical exfoliant, try a BHA chemical exfoliant. I like Paula's Choice 2% liquid, but PC makes a variety of very gentle BHA products. 

Other options: prescription urea cream from a dermatologist. This is actually really helpful for KP but it's also drying. My insurance covers it though so it's pretty cheap. 

Using a physical exfoliator is irritating to skin and can make microscopic tears, making the redness worse. BHA is soothing to skin (in addition to being a chemical exfoliant) and urea helps the skin to hold more moisture (as well as speeding cell turnover.)

Tretinoin (a prescription retinoid) is also a good option. I don't use it on my KP but I know people who have used it for KP. But I would use it as a last resort after trying BHA and urea.

I've been hearing this all my life, but I don't think it's true. AFAIK it is a myth with no science supporting it. I pretty much rub my eyes whenever, I am in my 40s, and I don't have crows feet or other eye wrinkles.

It's more likely that sun exposure, smoking, bad nutrition, dehydration, or your genes caused your crows feet. 

The thing about skin is that it is not like you get one skin when you are born and it falls apart over time. Your skin is constantly renewing itself. Aging happens because over time the process of renewal slows and breaks down. At your age it's still a fast and efficient process, unless you are doing things that damage that process (like sun exposure, smoking, bad nutrition, irritation). So you can't really ""break"" the skin and cause wrinkles that way.

5717,"Although you have some good points, I don't agree with everything in your comment, and I think some of your ideas are very problematic. 

For example, I think that the idea that making fun of someone ""brings us down to their level"" is actually very minimizing of abuse and is also a form of victim-blaming. My biomom *tried to kill me*, stole thousands of dollars from me, alienated me from my family, the list goes on and on. Making fun of her on an internet forum cannot *possibly* bring me down to her level. I would have to commit a ton of violent and petty crimes to come anywhere near her level.

Your standards of ""the better person"" are yours, and I think you are applying them inappropriately here. 

&gt;Harboring hatred on those who have done us wrong gets us nowhere and is an immature approach to dealing with problems effectively.

Point 1: Studies of survivors of child abuse show that desiring revenge or wanting bad things to happen to the abuser is a standard, normal part of survival and recovery. It is a way that survivors take back some personal power, until they are truly empowered. It is a phase that most survivors pass through, and it isn't helpful to call them immature, it's just shitty. Instead of meeting them where they are and offering help/support (or refraining from comment) you're just re-victimizing them. 

Point 2: a lot of people who post here are very young, some of them are actual teenagers. So calling them immature is again, not helpful, it's just mean. 

Point 3: not everyone is going to share your moral code. So if some people think it's nice when bad things happen to bad people, and you don't, you should probably just move on. You think that line of thought isn't healthy, but it can be healthy for people who are not you.

&gt; I understand that “moving out” isn’t always the easiest choice, but I can see others rolling their eyes at someone complaining about living with someone but not taking enough action to move themselves out of that environment. 

I can understand that reaction, but I think it's good to keep in mind that every situation is different. Some very young people are not able to leave yet, whether for financial reasons or others. Most people are *not* able to just up and move out right away, and in fact it is better for them long-term to have a plan and some financial cushion. 

Also, keep in mind that people are not empowered unless they know they are empowered. 

Finally: anger can be a very powerful motivational and survival tool. It can help sustain you when you have nothing else. Instead of being to judgey about the angry people, try feeling some compassion for them. I can say without a doubt that anger was what helped me stay alive for at least a few years.

I also really hate the degree of BS diagnosing that gets thrown around here. I would prefer that people describe behaviors rather than attributing various personality disorders to people.

5725,"&gt; His unhealthy behavior is obviously tied to a trauma that occurred before y'all met

I doubt it. He had a great childhood. We met in our early 20s. 

&gt;sadly your childhood exposure to hoarding made you ripe to choose a mate with the disorder. 

Actually, my childhood exposure to hoarding made me really, really anxious about becoming a hoarder, and very cautious about hoarding. It wasn't until some years into our relationship that I realized he was hoarding. It took us living together and me understanding that there is more than one type of hoarding for me to get it. See, the hoarding I was familiar with is the kind you see a lot on TV: hoarders keep specific objects because they ""might be useful"" or ""might be worth a lot of money."" I did not understand that there are other types of hoarding. 

He was very good at having excuses for whatever mess I saw at his house when I went there, and when we first started dating, there was a point when I said to him ""Look, the bathroom at your house is really gross and it makes me not want to go to your place. So if you want me to keep coming over, you need to clean it"" and he did. 

However, I was raised in a very abusive and neglectful environment, and part of that kind of abuse and neglect is that I had no insight into what kind of ""red flags"" to be aware of in a relationship, and I was also primed to be very accommodating to a partner. Today, if our relationship was just beginning, I would nope right out. But when we first started dating, I was young and I had never encountered this, and I did not understand that his apartment and his mess-making were red flags.

There's also what I read an author recently describe as ""the trangendering"" of desires, ambitions, fantasies, in that most of the heroes/examples offered to dynamic children are boys. ",2016-01-25 11:09:43+00:00,czb3z95,1.0,t3_41tnur,437231.0,aspergirls

5736,"""Lack of insight"" is actually a problem common to hoarding and to ADHD, and so is the inability to prioritize tasks. Impulsive spending is also a feature of both ADD and hoarding. There is a lot more overlap than I think most people are aware. 

In the ""lack of insight"" department, he insists that he does not have a problem, either with hoarding, or with squalor, or with his ADD. It took me years to convince him that he had ADD, and going on meds initially really helped him and he was happier as well. But the meds are not enough. He spends compulsively (often on items for his hoard) and that has put us in a really bad place financially. 

There's more than one kind of hoarding, and in this sub, things are oriented toward the kind of hoarder who is dealing with emotional disturbance. 

Research on hoarding shows that a lot of hoarders start hoarding after a traumatic experience, but that doesn't mean that they are dealing with an emotional pain by hoarding. In many cases it seems instead that the traumatic event has tweaked their brain somehow. Trauma is kind of interesting that way. 

He does engage in some compulsive spending and hoarding of specific objects, and it is those that he will freak out about me trying to get rid of. Even if they belong to me, he will try to stop me and get angry. 

The ADHD sub seems largely oriented toward people with ADHD. 

I assure you, I have tried for many years to help him to stop hoarding. I have tried pretty much everything suggested in the quick start guide. It's not like I just discovered that he is a hoarder.

5739,"I have looked at the quick start kit. Believe me, I have been dealing with this for DECADES, and my mother and her mother are also hoarders, so I am very informed about hoarding (I used to find it interesting, but now it's just really tiring.) 

My partner does not have any emotional pain or trauma he is dealing with (or failing to deal with.) He had a great childhood with loving parents and a supportive network of friends. He is in fact very popular, socially, and always has been. He has ADD and his hoarding seems to be related to that. His hoarding is really not addressed by the quick start page. He does not get emotionally upset by having his garbage thrown away or his mess cleaned up; *I* get emotionally upset because *he* won't lift a finger to do it. If I do it for him, he's pleased as punch, but I resent the idea that in order to have a clean house I have to clean up after him. In addition, I am physically and psychologically incapable of doing it.

His hoarding comes in two forms: 

1- garbage/dirt. He just won't throw his trash away. He will leave it wherever he happens to be. He just throws it on the floor. Did you see the part about an empty pork rind bag IN HIS BED? Beef jerky wrappers on the floor? 

2- Laziness/avoidance. He will not clean up a mess. If he spills something, he leaves it there. He will not bathe regularly, or wash his bed linens, or his clothes. Once we went camping and instead of dumping out the food coolers we took, he left them with all the food in rotting and moldering. And then he just *threw them away*. 

If he has a jar or bottle of something in the fridge, he will use all but the last little bit of it, and then leave the container in the fridge forever. In cleaning out the cabinet today I found a similar situation. 

He would rather get in his car and drive to a store and buy something, than look in the cabinet to see if we have it, or prepare a meal for himself. 

When a mess stacks up, he will shove it all into a box and then shove the box into a closet or a room or a storage unit. Then he avoids dealing with it. For a bonus, he will often take things of mine in this box and put them where I can't get to them; then he will say that the hoard is my fault, or equally mine, because something of mine is in the box, or because he has stacked his things up in front of mine so I cannot get to them. 

Compulsive buying is a much, much smaller part of his hoarding. He went on an SSRI several years ago and it was like a switch flipped, he stopped compulsive buying, but that effect has worn off. 

The only way in which he has the emotional responses that resemble the kind of hoarder you are describing is that he lacks insight AND he is very attached to a particular type of item, which is books. Once he got angry at me because I was going to sell a rare book of *mine*. It didn't even belong to him, but he got upset. I have suggested getting rid of books he does not read, he gets upset. I talk about getting rid of some of *my* books that I don't read, he gets upset. 

One thing I really dislike about the quick start kit is that there is an assumption that it is my job to fix the hoarder in my life, my job to ""coax"" him into recognizing his problem, my job to help him (when he refuses to help himself) etc. This is a common problem in this sub, it seems to b the common sentiment to place responsibility for the hoarder onto other people.

Like I was telling a friend of mine how much they bother me and it turned out she had never noticed them in all these years, even when they were as dark as yours. 

But here are the things that make a difference for me: keratolytics. You need to turn over those cells and get things moving out of your pores. 

1- Urea. Look for an OTC moisturizer with urea, or your derm can prescribe a urea cream. It's drying, but it really works for cell turnover and it is gentle. Using urea cleanser every day was great for me, but my cleanser was discontinued, and I'm not as good at using the urea lotion (because it is drying). So we move to:
2- 2% BHA. I use the Paula's Choice and honestly, it's been great for clearing up my SFs, which are mainly on my nose and forehead. I put it all over my face at night, and use it just on the t-zone during the day. I had to work up to this, though. 

Argan oil is high in oleic acid and lower in linoleic acid, so it is not good for SFs. Linoleic acid is more ""runny"" and oleic, and skin that is high in linoleic acid has less acne. If I try to use straight argan oil as my moisturizer, I get bigger SFs and more pore plugs. So in your shoes I would move to a high-linoleic oil. I still use argan at night, but I will mix one drop with another oil, rather than putting argan all over my face. 

It sounds like you are not using a sunscreen, and I advise that you add a daily sunscreen to your morning routine. Getting a tan does not make you more attractive to women, it just ages your skin and leads to cancer. ",2016-01-23 21:15:29+00:00,cz9b1kl,1.0,t3_42c4p0,8462.0,SkincareAddiction

5755,"&gt; I don't know, cartels do have a way of punishing family members for transgressions and debts of a person they are dealing with

No. Cartels do murder indiscriminately, but it's not about debts. (and a cartel is not a ""drug dealer"", and the cartel employees who kill people aren't either.) It is about terror. In fact interviews with former cartel hit men reveal that often, they will randomly kill entire families just to keep everyone else in fear. Just as an example, if this were a cartel killing, the whole family would be dead and probably buried in the woods. 

But cartels are not kidnapping toddlers in New Braunfels trailer parks. That is not their MO, and New Braunfels is not a border town. 

&gt;in this region of Texas, I can say with certainty that cartels have already infiltrated

I am highly skeptical of this. If you mean that people are selling cartel drugs in New Braunfels, yes, absolutely, because that's going on everywhere.

5796,"Thanks for explaining. The same issues still apply, though: your suggestions make me responsible for his behavior. This is not about my family ""traditional gender roles"" (because it doesn't.) It's about the social expectation in the West that women are responsible for men's behavior. 

Examples of how this plays out: women are supposed to dress modestly to keep men from raping us. Women are supposed to be submissive so husbands won't have to hit us. Women are supposed to keep their husbands happy, so they won't cheat. Women are supposed to hide their mistreatment at the hands of others, so that their men won't have to resort to violence and maybe go to jail. 

Once my hoarder said he was going to clean something ""tomorrow"" and I told him that I did not believe him. This was because I had been hearing the same thing for years- he will always say he's going to do a chore or clean something, and then he never does it. He had the nerve to say to me ""That's why I don't do these things, it's because you say stuff like that and don't believe in me."" (he eventually apologized for that remark.)

&gt;I've read that this helps some other hoarders, too.

Maybe so, but I would like to point something out to you: I specifically said in my first sentence that I needed to vent and was looking for support. Telling me how I can/should prevent my partner from hoarding is not supportive. Telling me what I should be doing differently is also not helpful or supportive. Over the years I have tried a LOT of different things to try to get him to not hoard. The problem is that hoarders lack insight, and until he sees that he has a problem, he will not stop. 

Right now I am *suffering* because my partner hoards, and instead of being supportive, you are focusing on how *I* can help *him*. That's really shitty. It does not help *me*. It just adds to my stress level. 

The truth is that I am no longer willing to help him with his hoarding in any way. I have spent years trying to ""help"". I am resentful, because he won't act on his own. If I wanted to clean up after someone and teach them how to be a functional adult, I would have a child.

5800,"&gt; Most addicts/alcoholics found in a 12 step meeting are going to like and be attracted to the idea if sitting on a group of people talking about themselves.

I think that this is untrue. My reasons: one, most people who go to a 12-step meeting are not there because they ""like the idea"". They are there because they are either court-ordered to be there, or because they desperately want help with their addiction, and  for whatever reason they believe that AA/12 steps will help them.

Two: your mistake is in not seeing the connection between criminal behavior and narcissism. You say yourself that the ones with the most extensive criminal records were the ones with narcissistic tendencies, but you mistakenly (probably because of preconceived biases) connect narcissism with addiction rather than connecting criminality with narcissism (when the two are actually strongly connected.) Even though you saw other addicts who weren't Ns, and you admit that they had less extensive criminal records, your biases are so strong that you have explained that away. 

In addition, the only addicts you encountered were the ones who had for whatever reason come into very bad straits: they were either homeless or connected with your organization usually via the court system (""there voluntarily"" doesn't mean they just showed up, it usually means that they were given a choice to enter into a program in order to defer adjudication, which isn't the same thing as being ordered by the court to complete a rehab program.) (You're not the only one with experience in this realm: I used to be a case manager for indigent people with HIV. Our patients who were addicts had specific care protocols that were different from our non-addict patients.) In addition, my family is full of addicts so I have seen some of them go through the system.) You were not encountering addicts who were functional, or addicts who had the resources to pay for private rehab or live with family instead of going through your program. 

The more extensive someone's criminal record, the fewer resources available to them. Family often distances themselves, and it becomes very very hard to get a job or rent an apartment or get an education and improve their lot in life (drug crimes in particular can limit one's eligibility for student aid.) 

Someone looking at your story, but *not* interpreting it through the lens of your own bias, can see that the main factors for successful recovery were a) Early intervention and b) access to resources. Less extensive criminal record = fewer years in active, dysfunctional addiction and more access to resources. 

Another problem with your belief that ""addicts/alcoholics tend to be either abusers or the abused"" is that it sets up a false duality. Sometimes a person is both an abuser and a victim.

It isn't stuff in the common areas so much as it is messes. For example, if he is getting himself a snack or feeding the cats, and he spills some food on the counter, or on the floor, he leaves it there. Even if the dishwasher has dirty dishes, he will usually not put his dishes into it, etc. 

So the basic work of ""keeping up"" with cleaning is made much harder, not just physically (more messes) but psychologically. I found that when I was living apart for a few years, I felt much more motivated to clean things. Now that I am living with him again, its hard to get motivated because I know that two seconds after I clean whatever it is, he will mess it up again. 

Another motivation issue is how the house has become a part of the hoard. For example, we moved here about 5 years ago. When we moved here, the walls were kind of patchy and need painting. He will not let me paint the walls. His reasoning: ""Well at some point we need to have the drywall redone."" Yeah, at some point we need that redone, but it's been FIVE YEARS.

That's not how Tylenol OD works. You have to take a big dose all at once, and then days later you die. 

My friend's mom committed suicide with Tylenol. She OD'd, went into liver failure, was not approved for the transplant list. But she lingered on for several days before she died, so she had a last chance to be the center of attention and fuck up everyone's life.

The thing is, you can't OD on Tylenol and then walk around for days like everything is ok. Liver failure is a visible illness. You turn yellow and then *green*. After a little while of liver failure, your kidneys will fail too.  You are weak and sick, you can't just walk around going out to dinner and having a normal life.

You think you are making assumptions based on inductive reasoning, but really you are making assumptions based on assumptions. For example, this ""Like what would be indicative behavior of someone who is having suicidal thoughts? Actions like acting withdrawn, high stress, or having financial issues would be such examples."" isn't inductive reasoning. It's just your opinion, one based on erroneous beliefs.

In fact people who are having suicidal ideation typically hide it (because of the social stigma, or the fear that someone will stop them) and act normal. Teenagers are known for ""being moody"" so emotional behavior changes wouldn't be considered odd. But someone upthread did say that Ellison was reported to be acting oddly in the month leading up to his disappearance. 

&gt;You can make your argument that Ellison may have been contemplating suicide with some idea of depression - but there are no reports of such idea

Yes, there was at least one report, from his teacher. 

Your argument that you are saying ""suicide"" rather than ""depression"" seems senseless to me, because suicide (with the exception of suicides in response to terminal illness) is caused by depression or poor impulse control.

Depression is a disease. It is a physical disease that affects us mentally. The idea that someone must have ""a reason"" to have depression is used to invalidate and hurt people with this disease all the time. In fact, people with depression *are suffering from depression.*

Maybe they ""wouldn't seem like the type"" to you, because you aren't very informed about suicide and depression. But as I mentioned, suicide is the second leading cause of death for people between 14 and 24 in the US. This reality conflicts with your belief that only people who have ""suffered a lot"" would kill themselves.

5835,"&gt;He was literally planning a lot of things during the time he went missing. School, skiing, tournaments, scholarships. If you're depressed, stuff like that doesn't get done.

It is actually very common for people to make lots of plans right before they commit suicide. There are basically two kinds of suicides: impulsive and planned. Some people plan their suicides for a long time, they tie up loose ends and prepare for their death. Other people feel the urge to suicide, but they resist the urge, sometimes for years. Until one day they don't resist, the impulse overcomes them, and they die. Doctors consider the second type of suicide to be an impulse control problem. 

The impulsive type of suicidal person doesn't expect to commit suicide. So they have plans, sometimes years in advance, and they don't prepare anything for their death. Having plans just doesn't rule out or even contradict a suicide theory.

Not producing the paper is not suspicious. A high school teacher deals with hundreds of papers every day, and papers are handed back to students after grading. 

Rumors also aren't suspicious because unfortunately, people *make shit up* all the time. 

I think it's probable that he committed suicide. People who are truly suicidal rarely tell their family members, because they don't want to be stopped. Suicide is a leading cause of death for young people. But I understand why his parents don't want to contemplate that.

Switching to a high-quality sunscreen helped a lot. I used to get rashes on my chest in the shape of the neckline of my shirt, because the combination of heat and sun and chemical sunscreen was aggravating my skin terribly. This was back when I used DS sunscreens; Olay was a favorite of mine. The way that chemical sunscreens handle UV includes getting really hot, because their electrons start moving faster. Faster-moving electrons are irritating to delicate skin.

I'm also very pale and super-sensitive! A few years ago I bought some wide-brimmed hats, and I wear those when I go out into the sun, or else I drape a scarf over my head. Any little bit helps, but I never leave the house without sunscreen. 

Yesterday I had to go out in the yard before sunscreen, so I tied a scarf around the lower half of my face, put on big sunglasses and a floppy wide-brimmed hat. 

You might also consider that the BP is not the best for you. If even low concentrations make you break out, perhaps you would be better served by an ingredient like BHA or tretinoin or urea.

We have been together a really long time and he has stood by me through some really bad stuff, including my own chronic illness. This is not a trivial relationship.

And he had the nerve to say ""It's because if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have bought such a large house. The house is the problem.""

This was enraging at the same time as it was sadly funny, because HE is the one who wanted this house. I wanted to buy a house with a garage apartment so we could have income property. He saw this particular (4-bedroom) house and said he ""loved it"" and that this was the one he wanted. I did NOT want this house. 

Now we have a neighbor whose house has a garage apartment, and that garage apartment rents for more than the mortgage on this place costs. I mean, if we had bought a place with a garage apartment, we would literally *not have to pay mortgage*.

5889,"Hi, I am offering my perspective as someone who was in foster care.

I think that you should go talk to CPS pro-actively. Explain to them that you are not sure you can take care of your sister's five kids. You might be surprised at the assistance they offer you. Foster parents get a monthly stipend per kid, and in many states the parents are actually charged child support to cover this. You seem to think that you taking in the kids = they just end up with you, without any support. That does not have to be the case. 

The best thing you can do for them and you is to get yourself connected to CPS as a potential foster parent NOW. That means you can receive a stipend and other assistance. The kids will not just be dumped into your lap. CPS can also offer support help, such as counseling for the kids, and supervise visits with their parents.

Getting involved with CPS as a potential foster parent also means that you have a great way to resist the inevitable pressure from your family to just give the kids back to your sister on the DL. 

If your sister's kids end up in other foster homes, they will almost certainly be split up. They might end up in situations where they literally never see each other again. This happened to my family and I cannot even begin to describe to you how destructive it was, for all of us. Destroying these relationships has lifelong consequences and they are not good.

If you have to cut back on material benefits for your kids (by which I mean non-vital material goods, not stuff like food, shelter, etc) I think that's actually minor compared to what you will be giving to them: lessons in kindness and compassion, as well as the benefit of a close relationship with their cousins, and a feeling of security in knowing that their parents are the kind who step up and commit to children.

This is a common misunderstanding of how DNA and DNA testing work. You cannot actually ""test for Native American heritage"". Unfortunately some companies are telling people this in order to sell tests and make money.

In general, and this applies only to North America, the further east in North America that a tribe lived before colonization, the more that tribe has intermarried and interbred with western Europeans and African Americans.

FYI: I don't think she can be classified as ""a runaway"" because she is an adult. When an adult ""runs away"", they are traveling.

This is a great example of how Ns infect victims with their ""logic"" and then the victims go on to perpetuate that and re-victimize.

1- Everyone has biases. Why do you think you ""need"" an unbiased account from him, or that there is something wrong with an unbiased account? His account will be told from his POV, and might include his pain and anguish, and those are all fair and valid.

2- The myth that only an ""unbiased account"" is trustworthy or valid is a way that Ns abuse and invalidate their victims. No one needs to give an ""unbiased account"" of their own experience.

3- your implication, that because he ""resents"" your parents, his account may be untrustworthy, indicates that you've internalized the SG-ing of your brother and I think that's really sad and tbh cruel.

5917,"Your Nmom is lying about most things, probably. I spent my teens in foster care and my Nbiomom told various lies about where I was and why I was there. Sometimes she even lied to herself about it.

She told my sister that the reason I was in care was because I threatened suicide. My sister never really questioned this until she was almost an adult, and then we talked about it. She said she had friends who threatened suicide and they went to hospitals, not foster care, so that made the story suspect to her. I told her the real reason (my Nbiomom was abusive.)

I'm really not sure what she told my brother, if anything. I was in care before he was born so to him it was just the norm. He told me that by the time he was old enough to wonder about it, it was just how things are, so he didn't (he doesn't think about other people really.) I asked him if he ever asked her why I did not live at home, and he changed the subject.

So, as someone who has been in your brother's situation: I think you should ask him. Tell him that you are suspicious that your mom didn't tell the truth about him, and ask him to tell you why he didn't live at home. Listen to him, respect him, and above all, *believe him*. I cannot stress this enough. Don't tell him you think he's making it up, or something like that. That's incredibly cruel. 

Just a note: your SO is wrong when he tells you that a CPS-type org would not send your brother to camp or foster without investigating your care or safety. CPS arranged for me to be in foster care and then never looked in on my younger siblings or checked to see if they were unsafe. In fact the foster agency I was placed with KNEW that my 2-year old sister was left alone ""in charge"" of my infant brother, and did nothing at all about it.",2016-01-03 12:08:25+00:00,cykapn2,1.0,t3_3yyfd7,224912.0,raisedbynarcissists

The idea that someone is obligated to be happy and make the best of things in every situation is rooted in a conservative protestant value system that's very oppressive.

I can't blame some people for being bitter. But that said, when you see an able-bodied person who is bitter or pushy, do you think it's because they are able-bodied and someone ""gave them a pass""? I doubt it.

5971,"&gt;&gt; I suspect that she may not have undergone a full autopsy and that the age was an estimate based on looks alone. To me she looks to be in her mid to late 20s.

She did have a post-mortem dental exam though, and there is no mention of wisdom teeth. If she were in her mid to late 20s, her wisdom teeth would have already erupted. I suspect that they took a lack of wisdom teeth into account when estimating her age. 

In that one pic, she does seem to resemble Keli McGinniss but I just looked up other photos of Keli and the resemblance does not carry over to other photos. 

It is highly unlikely that this victim was transgendered. It was almost unheard-of at that time for someone to have full transition surgery so young, and it was outrageously expensive. It took women YEARS to save for their surgery and they often had to have it done in stages (as many still do.) Before any doctor would even do the surgery, people had to ""live as a woman"" for at least two years. So I think we can rule out the idea that she is a trans woman. 

Also guess what? Women can be tall! And I don't think her facial features are ""masculine"" at all. Her brow is not heavy, her adam's apple not prominent, her jawline is soft, her hairline is not receded. I honestly think that when you say she has ""masculine"" features, what you mean is that you don't think she's pretty, but those are not the same thing.

One, why do your classmates rebuff your attempts are socialization? Are you sure that they are? Being raised by Ns can make you kind of socially stunted, because Ns are socially inept and they isolate and bully you. Not everyone is necessarily looking to socialize, but that doesn't mean they are rebuffing you. 

How do they ""find out"" that you have information they need? How does asking for this information equal ""all over you""? I ask because Ns tend to be opportunists, and so it can make you suspicious that anyone who is trying to be friendly to you or ask you for info is an opportunist or using you. 

It is actually completely normal and not malicious for classmates to ask each other for info on assignments, studying, test dates, etc. So it's possible that the reality is not that your classmates are mostly opportunistic users, but that they are just asking you normal questions and you are interpreting this through a lens of suspicion.

God this is so familiar. He gets so angry at me when I try to stem the hoarding. And I do feel like I have to police things all the time, because otherwise the hoard will take over (I'm trying right now to confine it to his rooms but it spills out.)

It's amazing that you were willing and able to clean your mother's hoard. I am neither willing nor able. I have tried for years to help him clean and get rid of things and it's always met with such hostility and resistance and the silent treatment and pushback. I've reached a state of enormous resentment at this point, that I am not any longer willing to help t all. And I am not able to just clean it all up myself and go on with life; I'm disabled and it would be physically impossible.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that if it were not for him, I would be dead. He's funny, he is smart, he used to be joyful and kind. 

No one else knows me the way he does. That might seem strange but it's so valuable to me in a way I cannot fully explain. What I mean is that when you have been intimately involved with someone for so many years, they see you at your best and worst and love you anyway. They *know* you and the things that have happened to you. We have so much history together, more than I have with any other person. 

I am loyal.

5998,"Oh believe me, I do examine my own habits all the time. My mother and her mother are hoarders (grandma is dead) and I have CPTSD. So I have had hoarder tendencies, and when I was 23 I said to myself ""I have to nip this in the bud before it gets really bad."" So ever since then I am very strict with myself about what I keep or get rid of. My rule for keeping something is that it must be useful or I must really *love* it. 

So, I do not hoard, not compulsively or otherwise. I *do* have a lot of things, and I actually think it's perfectly reasonable, and not pathological, to say that things like furniture, clothes, books, shoes, and art are more valuable and valid possessions than are empty fast food containers and dried up ball-point pens. 

When he compulsively shops, he actually does buy things that are useful, but then he never uses them. 

""Look I got a French press so I can make French press coffee!""-----&gt;puts it on top of bookshelf and never uses it again.
""I got a smaller French press, that other one is too big.""-------&gt; uses it once, leaves it sitting in the corner unwashed forevermore.
""I got a nice wooden cutting board!""-----&gt; never uses it
""I got a (mountain bike, aerobics stepper, yoga pillow, back massager, meditation pad, etc fitness equipment) for (fitness/health/etc)!"" ------&gt; never uses them, they rust/decay.

Which is another horrible thing about hoarding: they *keep* things, but they don't *take care"" of them. So many of the things he buys just sit around being ruined. 

The one who ""compares"" is him, in that whenever I ask him to clean up something or do something about the hoard, he tries to make an inapt comparison. When I ask him to open and deal with the last months' worth of mail that's been sitting on the table, I get a snarky ""Well what should I do with this stuff if yours that's on the table?!"" WRT some paperwork I need for a medical appointment, or the mail for me that just came *that day*.


When I say ""my room is a mess"", it is not because I am hoarding. It is because I am responsible for most of the housework, and I feel like cleaning my own room is lowest priority, because I ""ought to"" concentrate on the public areas and not just my private room. So I clean the public areas/common areas before I clean my room, but because of the hoarding, prioritizing the common areas means there's never time/energy for me to clean my own room.

I have my room divided into ""zones"" and every once in awhile I can tackle a zone and get it cleaned, but so far I haven't had the whole room clean in about 6 months, which is incredibly frustrating to me, because I want it clean. 

Oh and also he will not clear his stuff out of the chest of drawers in my room so some of my stuff that should go in there, can't.

I used to think that I was to blame for a lot of the problem, but I worked and worked on my own cleaning habits for years. And then I moved out for two years and you know what? I had a clean house. Clutter would build up sometimes, but then I would deal with it and put/throw it away. It turns out that when I am *not* living with someone who leaves messes and garbage behind them everywhere they go, I am able to keep a place clean. 

My depression stems from a)some shitty things happening in my FOO and b)the fact that he just *won't* clean up or change and I am basically facing the end of our relationship and I hate that. I don't *want* to break up, I love him enormously, but I am pretty sure (I'm trying to be in denial, lol) that I really *have* to move out and probably break up, for the sake of my sanity and health.  My embarrassment stems from the fact that *paint is falling off the walls and ceiling* but he will not paint or let me paint, and we still have *five year old paper blinds* in some of the windows, covered in fly shit, that he will not replace. (Except in his room, you bet your ass he just bought new blinds for in there!) It stems from the fact that when I was gone, fly infestations got bad, flies crapped all over various items of furniture and walls in the house and he just *left it there*.

I am seeing a therapist. Her solution is move out, full stop. She didn't even think I should have given him the ""last chance"" speech last month; she thought I should have just moved out. I didn't want to give up on him, though, I hate the thought of hurting him, and also he won't be able to afford his mortgage without me here so when I do move out I feel obligated to give him lots of advance warning.

My experience as an abuse survivor and working with abuse victims would lead me to see this differently. I would suspect that Casey did have clear memories of George molesting her, but that she was ""feeling out"" how people would react to saying so. This is very, very common among victims of child sexual abuse. 

Sometimes they say that they ""dreamed"" that they were abused, or that their friend was abused, because they are waiting to see how the person to whom they disclose will react. Will they be supportive, or dismissive, or angry, etc? Sometimes when questioned they will even deny, over and over, that they abuse happened. 

It could also indicate that George or Cindy or someone else had convinced Casey that what George did wasn't actually sexual abuse, for example by telling her that George was doing something else (""playing a game"" or ""taking care of"" the victim, etc) or by telling her that she had asked for it, provoked it, made it happen, etc, and that it was therefore consensual sex.

In these latter scenarios, it could be that Casey did remember being molested but had not yet framed the abuse as abuse, possibly because confronting that reality was very painful. ",2015-12-21 10:02:48+00:00,cy6gar8,1.0,t3_3xetv9,206689.0,UnresolvedMysteries

If the swim ladder was up, it would have been impossible for someone in the water to climb back into the boat. While Stempien's parents say she was always strait-laced on the boat, I read reports from some of her friends saying that she was often reckless and drinking on the boat. 

The water was 68 degrees. They could have been impaired by alcohol or pot, jumped in the water to swim and been stuck there without the ladder.

The soil is clay so it was basically impossible to walk around out there, the ground would just slide out from under you or stick to you. Also, it was still raining. This is important. 

Nmom worked nights. So one night before she was leaving for work, she commanded me to take down the Xmas lights while she was gone. I told her I wasn't going to do it- it was already dark outside and it was raining! Plus the mud would have made any ladder unstable. 

I think the very idea was unreasonable. Who takes down Christmas lights in the dark while it's raining? It was unsafe and I think she knew that and was hoping I was still so afraid of her that I would try to do it anyway and get injured. (She was extremely violently abusive toward me so this isn't actually farfetched at all.)

So again, I told her that no I was not going to do it. The next morning when we all woke up she immediately started in bitching at me because I hadn't taken down the Xmas lights. I lost my temper and I swore at her for the first time ever. I said ""No, I didn't take the lights down, because it was nighttime and it was *raining*, so doing that would have been *dangerous*, you fucking moron.""
