She recently made one where she mentioned changing her skin care routine to use a lot of chemical exfoliants and higher doses of hydroquinone for a period of 3 months. Apparently this is based on an Obagi claim that your skin takes 6 weeks to completely ""renew"", and that using actives very intensively for a 3- to 5-month period time will improve your skin overall. 

Do you think doing an intensive treatment like this for a short period of time is really superior, in terms of skin care and appearance, to using chemical exfoliants and other actives (like antioxidants and tret) year-round? I don't really see a benefit to irritation and redness.

The contents were mostly trash, with a few of ""my"" things inside. Like, once it was a box of trash with 2 tshirts I wore in junior high, buried inside. Another time it was a box of trash with letters from my deceased grandparents, again buried inside the trash.

My ex and I are in the process of splitting up our personal items. One of his hoarding behaviors was that he would go around the house and take random things and then put them in his own room. So a lot of my things ended up in his room, where I couldn't get to them because of the hoard (the floor was so cluttered that it was dangerous for me to wal in there.)

https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/search?q=somerton&amp;restrict_sr=on

Last night I was reading more in-depth about Somerton Man and I had a different idea that I haven't seen posted here before. I'm not saying that this is what I believe actually happened, but that this is a possiblity.

People usually propose that ""Jestyn"", the nickname for Jessica Thomson, was the ex-lover of the Somerton Man, and that he fathered her son Robin. 

Things I learned last night: Jessica Thomson did not marry Prosper Thomson, Robin's putative father (and the father of her other children), until some time in 1950. Before that, he was married to another woman and Jessica appears to have been his mistress for several years. 

She became pregnant with Robin sometime in late 1946. This is also when she moved from Sydney to Mentone, where her parents were living, and where Prosper Thomson lived also. We don't know if she became pregnant before or after moving to Mentone. Mentone is a suburb of Melbourne.

Right before Robin was born, in early 1947, she moved to Adelaide and changed her last name to ""Thomson"", the surname of her lover, and later husband, Prosper Thomson. This was a pretty genius move on her part, to obscure the fact that Robin Thomson was born illegitimate and that she was an unmarried mother. 

Some time in late 1947, Prosper Thomson joined her in Adelaide. However, he was not able to divorce his wife until 1949. Jessica, though, represented herself to neighbors and police as a married woman.

Somerton Man was found in Adelaide in 1948. Police believed that he came to Adelaide on the overnight train from Melbourne, Sydney, or one other city, but could not narrow it down more than that. Eventually the police investigation led people to Jessica Thomson (her unlisted phone number was found written in the back of the book from which police believed the piece of paper in the Man's pocket was torn. Incidentally, it wasn't the only phone number written in the book.) The detective investigating the case showed her a bust of the dead man. She said she did not know his identity, but the detective reported that when she saw the bust she looked shocked, as though she were about to faint. A lab technician who was present noted that she looked at the bust once and would not look at it again. 

So, Jessica Thomson had a son, Robin, who slightly resembled the Somerton Man. She seemed upset and near to fainting when she saw the bust, and would not look at it again, but said she did not know the man in question. She did tell police that a strange man had been asking neighbors about her. 

Years later, she told her daughter that she had lied to police: that she did know the man, and that his identity ""was known to a higher level than the police force.""

So here is my theory about the relationship between Somerton Man and Jessica Thomson: I don't think he was her secret lover. I think maybe he was a rapist and that in 1946, Somerton Man raped Jessica Thomson. 

If Jessica Thomson was raped and conceived a child through rape, she had very good reasons for wanting to keep that a secret. We've all seen the way rape victims are blamed, shamed, and hounded today; it was hundreds of times worse in the 1940s. Jessica would have been shamed and ostracized if people knew she had been raped. Her son, Robin, would have been shamed and ostracized had people known that he was a child of rape. She might never have been married, and she would have carried multiple social stigmas: both unwed mothers and rape victims were stereotyped as hypersexual, ruined, immoral, damaged, etc. 

Most rapes are committed not by strangers, but by friends or acquaintances. Maybe Somerton Man was someone Thomson knew, maybe a friend, but maybe just an acquaintance. Maybe he raped her  in 1946, and she was afraid to tell anyone. 

Maybe he heard through the grapevine, a few years later, that she had had a son, and did the math and decided the child was his. So he tracked her down. He found her and her phone number by asking neighbors. According to Australian 60 Minutes, he was last seen knocking on the door to Jessica's house.

It's possible that either Jessica Thomson or Prosper Thomson answered the phone or opened the door to Somerton Man. He made threats about Robin, and in response, one of them killed him. 

Derek Abbott said in his AMA in this sub that Jessica told a friend that Prosper ""did the right thing by raising [Robin] as his own."" This indicates that Prosper knew Robin was not his biological child, but claimed and raised him anyway. If Prosper knew that Jessica had been raped, and her rapist arrived at the house, I can imagine that Prosper would have killed him. 

Of course, this presupposes that SM was killed, rather than dying of positional asphyxiation, which is also a possibility (one that Derek Abbot favors.) It's possible that SM knocked on Jessica's door, asked the neighbors some questions, and then walked down to the beach, intending to sit for awhile and go back to the house later. He sat down to smoke a cigarette, fell asleep, and died of positional asphyxiation.

Shaving was really aggravating the skin, it was actually *craggy*, always red and irritated. So I had laser hair removal in 2014.

I use Degree ""clinical strength"" antiperspirant/deodorant because I am a person who sweats a lot.

I told him I was done. I've given him many chances to get it together, he isn't doing that, he hasn't met any of the conditions he agreed to for us staying together (medication, ADD coaching, no more lies, cleaning up, some other stuff).

I did call his psych NP. She would not speak to me (not surprising) but asked me to leave her a detailed voicemail. Instead I texted her, telling her everything going on. She said that if he comes back in to see her, she will address these things with him. She said she thinks he might actually need emergency treatment in a psych hospital. I was surprised she shared that with me. 

He has not gone back to the psych doc or NP at all. So he's still off meds. In addition, a few weeks after we broke up, he was removed from his leadership position in the service organization in which we volunteer. He will not tell me exactly what was said to him or what he did that resulted in removal, but he said it was because he ""fucked up."" He did say ""I'm sorry, if I hadn't been such a fuck-up the past few years this wouldn't have happened."" But he has been lying to other people about what happened. 

I told him that it seems to me that there is no ""rock bottom"" for him. There's nothing that will make him decide to stop lying, control his spending, get help. 

I'm moving out, I hope next month.

He's not being mean to me, but I'm really sad about our breakup and sometimes I cry. He *does not care*. When I told him I was moving out I started to cry. He just looked at me. I'm trying to disengage. I want to ask him WHY he didn't care enough to save our relationship, etc, but I know he will just say ""I don't know,"" and that will make me angry and hurt me even more. 

I know he's not my responsibility, but I still love him in spite of everything and I honestly don't know how he will cope when I move out. For some reason, about a week after we broke up he started refusing to eat my cooking. So now he's surviving on Atkins frozen meals and I assume fast food that he gets when he is out. I know he cannot pay for the house without me here. 

When he is angry with me, or when in the past I've pointed out that he's not keeping up with his agreements, there is a thing he does- he very ostentatiously ""cleans"" his rooms. He's been doing that, making a show of cleaning and throwing thing away, but only in his own rooms. In the past he has had a history of making effort when he thinks I am going to leave, to try to convince me to stay, but it never lasts. 

I feel like someone died. This is the most important, significant relationship of my entire life. I am so full of grief. I wish things had gone a different way.

It seems that different studies contradict each other. 

My experience: I have (probably congenital) reactive hypoglycemia (treated with ""link &amp; balance"" diet and metformin.) My hbA1C was 5.4 when I was diagnosed with RH and it remains 5.4 today, even after 3 years on metformin and the diet. I have no symptoms of diabetes, but I come from an ethnic group that has a LOT of diabetes so I am always worried about that. 

I also have Celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and frequent gastroparesis. I am under the care of multiple doctors. 

My RH requires me to get a lot of protein in my diet and the gastroparesis, which has been very bad lately, makes eating difficult, and also makes keeping my BG stable difficult. I like to drink whey protein isolate (unflavored) mixed with whole, unhomogenized milk to help give myself a protein boost, or for a post-workout protein, or to link/balance a carbhy snack, or to get some calories and protein into me when the gastroparesis is bad. 

Without fail, WPI makes me FEEL really good. It increases my energy levels and makes my blood sugar ""feel"" really stable (I did just get a BG meter but I'm not in the habit of testing yet.) I mean, I can tell when I have a spike/crash and that just does not happen when I drink WPI. WPI also seems (from my observation) to soothe my UC. When I drink it regularly I have less bloating, pain, and bleeding. I've also noticed that when I am craving a sweet, drinking a cup of the WPI mix stops that craving. 

So I started trying to read up on WPI and why it might have these effects. I see a lot of contradicting claims. Some people claim, and cite studies to support, that WPI causes an insulin spike; if this is the case then I should NOT be drinking it because this is the opposite of what I need. My RH means that if I have an insulin spike, I will have a crash. But I don't crash after I drink WPI.

Some other people claim, and also cite studies, saying that WPI does not cause an insulin spike, but that it increases insulin sensitivity. For me this would be a good thing. 

Can anyone clarify for me what is accurate? I am asking specifically about WPI and not about dairy or milk in general. Thank you!

One of the mods of that sub has twice now accused me of being ""secretly critical"" when making a positive/supportive comment and it's really frustrating. 

The first time I was banned from the sub, I was told that the mods had ""had to delete too many of my comments"". But it turned out that none of my comments had been deleted and the mods had even scolded another member for reporting my comments. One of the mod claimed that I make almost no positive or helpful comments and accused me of having ulterior motives that I certainly did not have. That mod sent me a really nasty, accusatory direct message, then muted me so I could not message the other mods on the mod channel anymore.

I contacted another, more reasonable mod directly, pointed out the errors above, and asked if there had been a mistake. She thanked me for contacting her and said there *had* been a mistake, I should not have been banned, and unbanned me. 

Yesterday I was banned again, and again a positive comment I made was highlighted as a reason I was banned. A redditor made a comment about getting his kids sleepy at night by playing them really hard all day. I said ""This is exactly how childhood is supposed to work"" and the mod said that comment was ""critical"" and banned me. They claimed I had ""been warned"" but I never was (this is the same as the first time I was banned, btw, I was never ""warned"" but they insist I was.)

On another occasion, a redditor was being pretty nasty out of nowhere to me and said ""I don't need to explain anything to you"" (which was true, they didn't, and I hadn't asked them to.) My response was ""You are in charge of your needs,"" and in response to that I received a fucking novel about how horrible I am and I am supposedly attacking her.

The thing is, in that sub I constantly and consistently receive responses from other users thanking me for my  comments and saying that what I said helped them. So it's really frustrating when the mods say that I am never helpful, always critical, etc. It makes me feel like the mods are just nuts, or one of them has it in for me for an unknown-to-me reason. 

Stuff like this makes me feel sometimes like NTs are dangerously unstable.

&gt;Cannabinoid receptors (CR), which mediate the psychopharmacological action of marijuana have been not only localised in the central and peripheral nervous system but also in human skin. CR1 and 2 are expressed in human sebaceous glands,69 whereas the CB2 and other prototypic endocannabinoids are present in SZ95 sebocytes and may induce in a dose-dependent manner lipid production and cell death.

How likely is it that cannabis I inhale would affect cannabinoid receptors in my skin to the degree that would induce cell death and lead to dehydrated skin with AD?

So there were no adults (or other kids) around to describe these events to me or induce a false memory. However, I have definite memories of my 2nd birthday party, of a trip abroad when I was about 3 or 4, of lots of things from before the age of 4. 

As an adult, when I was in my mid-30s, I reunited with my stepmother and she confirmed that these memories are accurate. Some of them are even confirmed by photos she has! She was absolutely shocked that I remembered these things, that I even remembered her. She had expected that I would not remember any of it. 

When I was a kid my biomom was always really shocked when I would ask questions about my dad or talk about him. I think someone must have told her that I would forget him. 

I've also read that traumatic events usually fry the memory system, but for me, traumatic events are *very* vivid. The moments before and after might not be, but the event is super-vivid. 

I've been wondering if this might be a way that autistic brains are different from non-AS brains. ",aspergirls,"DAE have really, really good or early episodic memory?",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergirls/comments/48e0no/dae_have_really_really_good_or_early_episodic/

The more I think about it, the more I think that we don't actually have ""communication problems"", we just communicate differently than non-AS people. Since society privileges non-AS people and their communication choices over ours, our style is labeled a problem.

I'm in a difficult and stressful situation. I'm a member of a volunteer organization, and I am going through a mediation process within the organization. The person controlling the mediation is not abiding by the rules, and not being honest. I mentioned to a friend who is advising me, that I was tempted to just go to the person in control and ask them if the intended outcome is for me to leave the organization, because if that *is* the end game, I will just resign. I find the mediation process very traumatizing, and if I'm going through this for nothing, I would much prefer to know, so I can resign rather than go through this misery. 

My friend/adviser told me ""Don't do that! It will ruin your case! It comes across like an emotional vent and not an honest question.""

And that's where, for me, there's a giant disconnect. Because it is an honest question. Why is asking an honest and direct question met with such aggression and hostility? Why is being direct interpreted as being rude or ""emotional vent""? I mean, if I were to ask, I would ask respectfully and politely. 

One thing that continually frustrates me (and I think I've mentioned it here) is that non-AS people often attribute to me ulterior motives that I don't have. It seems like an exhausting way to go through life. If I am asking a direct question it's because I want to know the answer and I respect you enough to ask you directly, because that seems to me to be the right thing to do.

So today I decided to clean/organize the bathroom storage cabinet as it's become more and more chaotic. Hidden in the back of it are stacks and stacks of unopened boxes of disposable contact lenses. Some of them are more than a decade old. They are long-expired. 

He could have thrown them away himself at any time but he is just too lazy to lift a finger. Too lazy to walk to the garbage can. (Around the house, he throws his trash on the floor or leaves it anywhere else he happens to be.)

So in the bathroom we have old contact lenses that he won't throw away. IN the fridge, he will use all but the last little bit of food in a container and then leave the container in the fridge. His excuse for not throwing it away is that ""it's not used up"", but he NEVER uses it up. It's clearly an excuse to not deal with throwing it away. 

Unlike a lot of hoarders, my spouse does not always get upset or emotional about throwing things away. He just refuses to do it himself. His bedroom floor is littered with beef jerky wrappers. He has an empty pork rinds bag in his bed. He will not lift a finger to put a piece of trash in the garbage, unless (for some reason) it's something that needs to be recycled; then he refuses to put it in the recycling bin, but puts it in the trash can. And he only does this if he's standing right next to the bins (if then.) I have seen his parents house and while it is messy sometimes, it is not a hoard. His mother throws garbage away without a second thought. In fact she will throw stuff away that even a non-hoarder might want to keep. So I don't know where he got this refusal to throw garbage away, this habit of just throwing trash on the floor, but it really pisses me off. 

In addition to this, may I mention again that these contacts are never-opened? He got them because his insurance would pay for them and then never wore them. Then he didn't even bother to deal with them before they expired- they could have gone to charity or something, right? Hoarders KEEP things but don't care for them, so the things they keep get ruined.

Other ancient things in the bathroom cabinet: his prescription mouthwash, expired 2012. A jillion packs of flossing picks, because instead of using the ones he has already, he buys more. A million loose ponytail holders. 

Hoarders, if you knew how much your hoard was damaging your marriage and family relationships, would it motivate you to get help and stop hoarding?

No one in my birth family likes me. My biomom hated and abused me from birth until I was in my early 20s. I have several siblings, and their attitudes toward me vary from indifferent to hateful. I had one sister to whom I was very close, who really ""got"" me and loved me, but she died a few years ago. She left behind two young children and she told me before her death that she wanted me to raise them, but they are being raised by my stepmother, who hardly ever lets me see them. 

My stepmother used to like me when I was a child. She pretends that we have a great relationship, calls me her daughter, etc. But she is an enabler to the abusers and addicts in my family. Since my close sister died, our other sister has basically become very abusive toward me, and when I set a boundary on that abuse, my stepmom began to ostracize me.

My father is deceased. But my stepmother told me that I was his favorite of all his children, and that he loved me best. 

There are a lot of other details and issues I am leaving out. But what it comes down to is that my entire family dislikes me and I don't know why. Believe me, it has affected my self-esteem. I had to ask myself the inevitable but reasonable question: am I unlikable? I mean, when the common denominator is me, I have to wonder if the problem is me too. Is it my fault?

But the problem with that theory is that lots of people outside my family find me likable. I have good friends, and many friendly acquaintances. I have successful and fulfilling romantic relationships. I used to have a successful and popular blog. So while it's possible that I am the problem, I don't think at this point that I am, and neither does my therapist. I made a decision years ago to make kindness the ruling principle of my life.

It's very painful to be rejected by your family. I always wanted a close relationship with them, and they don't want that. They don't care. I haven't ever *done* anything to them, and in fact we were raised separately to an extent, so I never had typical adolescent conflicts with any of them. The rejection I face from the rest of them makes the loss of my sister even worse: only one person in my family loved me, and she's dead. 

My partner thinks that my family are not intelligent and that they, like a lot of stupid people, are insecure because I am smart. I do know that my sister who treats me the worst is deeply insecure and feels threatened or upset by people making choices different than the ones she makes. 

I'm just hurting a lot. I feel really alone. My therapist thinks I should go no-contact with my entire biological family, but I hate the idea of never seeing my nieces and nephews again. ",aspergers,Ostracized by my family,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/40jyrc/ostracized_by_my_family/

When I was growing up, we were very poor, largely because of very bad decisions that my Nbiomom made. 

Yet there was always money for Nbiomom to buy expensive skin and hair care products, there was always money for her to buy whatever clothes she wanted, or go on a vacation with her friends, etc. Meanwhile I always had the cheapest and poorest of everything: cheap, ill-fitting clothes and shoes, cheap shampoo/conditioner that was not appropriate for my hair, nothing for skin care at all. My hair always looked a mess, my clothes were terrible, my shoes falling apart. I was constantly mocked and picked-on at school for my appearance. 

Any time I expressed a desire for anything nice, I was made to feel guilty, I was ridiculed, called ungrateful. 

Now as an adult it has been SO HARD to believe that I ""deserve"" nice things or pleasure or happiness or relaxation. I feel guilty whenever I spend money on something for myself. 

I got into a relationship with someone who had a problem with compulsive spending and hoarding. He would always say that we were broke and that it was my fault (because I am very sick and cannot make much money) but there was always enough money for whatever he wanted for himself. Sound familiar? He is not N but has severe ADD and it can make people seem very N. He would always make me feel very bad about our financial situation, and say that it was because he was supporting me. He complained whenever I bought anything for myself, no matter how small or cheap, I had to justify every dollar spent. It drastically heightened my anxiety over spending money. One time I had only one pair of pants that fit me, they were sweatpants, and I wore them every day for about 3 months. Finally the weather started to get hot, these pants were falling apart, and I decided that I just *had* buy myself a pair of pants that fit. He made it this big anxious deal. 

But when I talked to a friend about this, she told me that her husband made the same amount that my partner made, but they had 2 kids and a house, and were not broke! So why were we broke all the time? It turned out to be because of his compulsive spending. He would fritter money away left and right, and tell me everything was fine (when I would say ""Can we afford this?"" and ""How are the finances?""), and then suddenly one day he would be freaking out and say we were broke, in trouble, everything was terrible, it was all my fault, etc.

Because of my N upbringing I just accepted that it was not right to get nice things for myself when we were so broke. This really did a number on my self-esteem. 

I am slowly learning that it's ok to get nice things for myself sometimes. It's really hard. ",raisedbynarcissists,This is why we can't have nice things! (Seriously.),https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3zy1rr/this_is_why_we_cant_have_nice_things_seriously/

I have had it since around 2011 or 2012. It pretty much blossomed as soon as I went on HBC pills in my mid-30s. 

My dermatologist prescribed hydroquinone cream. The problem was that every time I tried using it, my skin would be very irritated, and the melasma would darken. So I never stuck with it for more than a few weeks at a time. I stopped trying to use it in 2014. Is it normal for hydroquinone to make melasma darker? 

More background info: 
This year has been very very hard for my skin. I am on a medication that has made it very dry and reduced the elasticity. My skin has aged a lot, and in the winter it got really bad. And recently I realized, that my melasma is spreading. It's crawling down my face. It used to be just on my cheekbones, and it's moving down my face in the center.

This fall I worked hard to improve my skin's hydration. I also started using .025% tretinoin about 6 weeks ago, twice a week, because there is research saying tret helps with melasma. 

I use a very heavy sunscreen (Josie Maran SPF47, before I was using EltaMD SPF45), avoid the sun, wear hats. I also use lots of moisturizers, and the tret only twice a week. I seem to have gotten the dehydration and accompanying irritation, under control but what (else) can I do about the melasma? Has anyone else had success fading it without hydroquinone?

Skin type: combination usually, dryer in winter than in summer, but this year it has been dehydrated. Thin, pale, sensitive, congested in its natural state.

My spouse is a hoarder. We have been together for 10+ years. He won't even admit that he is a hoarder. He is the kind of hoarder who won't throw trash away, won't clean up any messes he makes, and compulsively buys some things and then just hoards them. The compulsive buying is a much smaller part of his hoarding than the uncleanliness and garbage, and because it's such a small thing, he always brushes it off. 

I'm at the end of my rope. 5 years ago he bought a house (ostensibly for us, but not really.) The house has become a part of his hoard. He will do almost no work on maintaining the house, so it's slowly falling apart around us. I have gently suggested that he should sell it if he cannot maintain it, and he refuses. He would rather just live in it while it falls apart. 

I moved out for a few years. I was in another city for educational reasons, and it seemed like he was making an effort toward progress. But I moved back in and it's just right downhill again. The hoard makes me feel so stressed and overwhelmed. No matter what I do, I cannot have a clean, nice-looking house, because he will not cooperate. My own room is a mess right now, because I don't have time to clean it, because I am struggling to keep the rest of the house clean. I am terribly depressed. 

I've had many nice things I owned, some of them heirlooms, ruined by his hoarding. He also has ADD and randomly goes off his medication sometimes. 

I told him a few months ago that unless he made a major change, I had to move out. He gave me the silent treatment for a few days and made a big show of ""cleaning"" and ""throwing things out"". That lasted about a week. Whenever his hoarding comes up he always tries to blame me, like he will immediately point out some item of mine that I haven't dealt with. Yes, I have Old Thing X that needs to be unpacked, but I don't have 2 feet of fast food trash on my floor. 

A week or so before tht conversation, I found out that his hoarding is NOT entirely a secret. Basically, some of our friends know, and let me know that, and it made me feel so embarrassed but simultaneously more able to confront it again. I've kept it very secret because I didn't want to embarrass him. 

I've tried talking to him about it MANY times over the years. I've begged, I've pleased, I moved out, I've tried lots of things. 

I have a lot of autoimmune diseases and I think that living here is actually making me sick. I was getting more healthy before I moved back in, and since then I've been sicker and sicker. 

I have tried telling him how hurtful his hoarding is. It communicates that he does not care about anyone or anything except his immediate desires and convenience. I've told him it's a danger to his health. He even got a very bad skin infection from his poor hygiene.and dirty room but nothing spurs him to change.",hoarding,I'm new.

I have 5 young nieces and nephews via two of my sisters. One sister is deceased and her two small children are being raised by my stepmom. The other sister is N and is abusive toward me (and was abusive toward our deceased sister, with whom I was very close.) She has three kids, the oldest a teenager, but the others very young.

I recently went back to therapy after several years away. My return was sparked by the death of my deceased sister and abusive behavior toward me from Nsister. 

My therapist thinks I should go NC with my entire family. I am considering taking this advice, but the number one obstacle for me is the children. My deceased sister was very specific about wanting me to be in her children's lives in case of her death, but my stepmom is really in control of that and I almost never see them. My Nsister's kids I have seen very seldom this year. I used to see them more often. She and stepmom have tried to keep me from coming to the kids' birthdays this year, from knowing their sizes for Xmas presents, and I am guessing they will avoid our usual ""family Christmas"" that we have a few days after calendar Christmas.

I am thinking of taking my therapist's advice and going NC. But I really love these children, and also, I think it would be very painful for them if I just disappeared from their lives. When I was a kid, several people did that to me (largely because my Nmom alienated people left and right) and it was very hurtful and contributed to my fears of abandonment. Especially since my youngest niece and nephew just lost their mother last year, and youngest niece's father is not in the picture, I think this would be very hurtful for her.

My options are:
1- just stop coming around, calling, maintaining contact. Fade away, basically. Never say anything to the kids, hope that they find me when they grow up. 
2- Send a letter to the oldest niece, who is almost 16. Explain to her that because her mother had been hurting me, I won't be able to see her for awhile, but that I love her and will always be here for her if she needs me. Ask her to explain to the younger kids when she thinks they are ready. 
3- Ask my Nsister's ex-husband and his girlfriend if I can come to their home to meet with Nsister's kids and explain the situation, or if I can take the kids out to dinner to explain. Tell them good-bye and that I love them and will always be here if they need me. I'm not sure that the ex-husband will actually say yes.

I suspect that options 1 or 2 will lead to being showered with abuse, but I just won't pick up the phone in that case. I think thought that if I exercise either of those options, it will be a large and permanent break in those relationships. 

It makes me very sad to think of not having these children in my life. I love them so much. ",raisedbynarcissists,"If I go NC, what do I say to the kids?",https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3yl4kn/if_i_go_nc_what_do_i_say_to_the_kids/
