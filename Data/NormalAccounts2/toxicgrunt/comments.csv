""In Flanders fields the poppies blow

Between the crosses, row on row,

That mark our place; and in the sky

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

Scarce heard amid the guns below.


We are the Dead. Short days ago

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie

In Flanders fields.


Take up our quarrel with the foe:

To you from failing hands we throw

The torch; be yours to hold it high.

If ye break faith with us who die

We shall not sleep, though poppies grow

In Flanders fields.""

There civilians talked to my workers everyday and their government saw the money roll in. They are very autonomous already. I didnt post this because I was gone that week but that one post means more than you think it does, they where invaded. There was not much else I could do. Our cultures like each other. Our governments have been together before. Yugoslavia already existed because of Montenegro, and Greece, their neighbor, invaded them. The buildup was already there. Yugoslavia's economy is going up faster than ever which only means more money flowing it, as Macedonia cant be rebuilt in only a couple years. And as a state of Yugoslavia we can do **a lot** more than just foreign aid. We can pass laws, superior education system, the new space program and many more things. IMO this makes perfect sense. Also, Macedonia had 0 military after the invasion, but Yugoslavia now has the biggest military in the Balkans.

822,"[M] The Dayton Agreement was signed in 1995. A part of that agreement stated the the Serbian populated land in Bosnia, the Republika Srpska, would be autonomous. Srpska was an ally to Serbia in the Yugoslav wars and there was absolutely no way it could be in Bosnia without autonomy. Dayton gave Srpska autonomy and a constitution. Bosnia has to uphold their constitution which also grants autonomy. Bosnia decided to make comments about cultural unification, a ""Greater Bosnia"", integrated Srpska, and a whole new language. Seeing this as an obvious sign of Serbian culture oppression, we asked for a diplomatic solution. Italy hosted the meeting. The discussions lasted several in game months. During the meeting Bosnia decided to integrate Srpska fully. This just voided the entire conference and Dayton agreement, I mobilized. I asked for peace one last time. During about 2 in-game months I had to restrain myself from invading when Bought 295 tanks. Then about 2 months after my mobilization and final call for peace, Bosnia recruited 25,000 soldiers.

980,"I kind of agree. This issue has also affected the meta of the game as well. On the IRC an unnamed player was discussing how he needs to make military factories in order to add a single thing to his military. He was then told to just buy from other countries like they do IRL. However, with these new rules that will **never** happen. The strong country's production power has been nerfed so much that they will be producing things by themselves, for themselves from the start of the game to the end of the game. BUT, the mods have to consider the fact that WP players don't act as leaders do in real life. Must of us aren't knowledgable about production or how military should be upgraded. Say that the rules of production are like real life and Russia produces thousands of things at once. But they should also export thousands of things at once. In 2012 1,309 military contracts where signed and Russia exported 15 billion dollars worth of military equipment. I doubt WP players are going to sell their only military. It doesn't only take the incompetence of a big country to ruin the balance of the world, it also requires the incompetence of small countries. Say the claimant of Serbia doesn't know that he is supposed to buy MiGs from Russia every few years, so hey doesn't even ask. Now Russia's military is skyrocketing and Serbia's is stagnant. The mods have to account for this as well. (I only used Serbia and Russia as an example because i didn't want to involve any one else.

1036,"   In my opinion, the British where the villains in the revolution, but someone who thinks that the war was all about tax would say otherwise. It wasn't all about taxes. The problem first arises when King George III decides to try and enforce the British Navigation Acts. This made US trading ships always have to dock in Britian and use British ships before they could trade with a different country. 


   Then in 1765 the British pass the stamp act wich requires the colonies to pay a tax on almost everything. Taxes where fine but the problem was the colonists had no representation in parliament. They could not do anything about those taxes. When the colonists went to America they where promised the rights of an Englishman, obviously they didn't have them. The British lowered the stamp taxes and then passed the Townsend acts in 67. A hidden tax taken from shippers at the port. This caused mass riots boycotts because once again, the colonists didn't vote on it. This led to the Boston massacre and all the bad publicity that received. All accounts I have seen of that incident are very biased but the important thing to know is unarmed colonists where shot. Then in 73 Britain passed the Tea act. This forced the colonists to buy British tea. (the thing that made the colonists the most angry was this. It wasn't even tax, it was a monopoly. However this act forced colonists to pay the Townsend taxes on British tea).The Boston port denied entrance of a British ship with tea. The british fought their way in anyways. Then the Boston tea party happened. 


After this event the Britished passed what was dubbed the intolerable acts. This turned Boston into a police state. The ports where blocked, the local government was taken over by the British and troops land in Boston. And if things couldn't get any worse, the British pass the quartering act and the Quebec act. The quartering act allowed British troops to stay in occupied private homes. British had forbid the colonists from crossing the Appalachian mountains because that was Indian land. The Quebec act expanded Canada (of French culture owned by Britain) down south to the other side of the mountains, where the ""americans"" could not go. To make things worse, the French didn't need to have trials by jury. Britain just set up juryless trials and *the French* right next to the 13 colonies.


   The war started shortly after at Lexington April 19 1775. It's also worth mentioning the U.S. didn't want independence. After the battle of bunker hill  the colonists sent the Olive Branch Petition July 5 1775 literally asking to stop the fighting and to re-enter Britain. At that point George was hellbent on war and denied it. Then indepence became a popular option in 1776 when Thomas Paine published Common Sense.",2016-01-14 18:13:38+00:00,cyy5t88,3.0,t1_cyy3pxc,2816,AskReddit
1037,"Yes, it is a ""kind of noble gas"". However, its properties are likely not like a noble gas, or perhaps a lot like a noble gas. Most people view a noble gas as one that doesn't bond, but that isn't true, kr, xe, and rn bond because they are so big. The inner electrons repel the outer so much that it can ""balance"" other forces keeping it together, making it easier to lose their outer electrons and bond (nuclear sheilding). That was a oversimplified explanation but it is a big reason. So if more electrons means easier bonds; the amount of compounds a noble gas should form should be rn&gt;xe&gt;kr, but its really xe&gt;kr&gt;rn. If rn has so much shielding why does it bond the least? Because it is so big it is so unstable that it doesn't have the time or the chance to bond. Extend that to 118, it is so unstable it would probably never bond. But if we somehow made it stable it would be the easiest to bond. So in theory, 118 is the most noble/least noble gas on the table.",2016-01-02 16:57:01+00:00,cyjehrw,2.0,t1_cyjdmd2,1634,worldnews

1059,"Jeffersonian revolution is somewhat (completely) a hyperbole. It is used to describe how the new republican nation was able to switch controlling parties (Federalist to Democratic-Republicans) without bloodshed. This idea isn't really book worthy. It is however a part of the much bigger Jeffersonian *Democracy* which was the ideals of Jeffersons followers. One of those ideas happened to be transferring power peacefully. But in all honesty, these are just terms used to make a historian's explanation shorter. You could probably receive all the information you need to know in a book about politics during Jefferson's presidency as you would a book called Jeffersonian democracy.

Edit: I hope I'm not making this confusing, ill try and clear it up: All I really mean is that Jeffersons election was important for showing coups where not needed because it was the first transfer of power between parties and it happened peacefully: Reading a book about Jefferson's presidency might give insight on how this happened.",2015-11-20 04:30:45+00:00,cx6kn1b,3.0,t1_cx6jva4,1497,AskHistorians
1060,"In short, no. It was established that America could function without coups after Jefferson was elected president peacefully (sometimes called the jeffersonian revolution).

Macguire to join a plot consisting of business men and a 500,000 private army headed by Representatives John W. McCormack of Massachusetts and Samuel Dickstein of New York. They wanted to establish a fascist government and overthrow Roosevelt. General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as the ruler. This plot was supposably backed by Chase Bank. No one was prosecuted and everyone who was a part of it denied it's existence. It was considered a big hoax but after a 2 month investigation evidence suggest it might have been considered. But no one knows.
