Mr. Vaso sat in a black, leather, chair that ran all the way up to his head. Vaso had stopped looking at the papers on his desk to gaze out the massive glass window to his left. He couldn't tell himself if he was daydreaming or strategizing. Vaso was a man who never stopped thinking, everything he did was done in a way that guaranteed perfection. He never made a mistake, and such a task weighed heavy on the man, and stress was a common problem in his everyday life. At 33 years old his hair was turning grey and bags under his eyes had turned to wrinkles. 

He moved his eyes and attention back to the files on his desk. There he saw the lists of people with accounts in his 27 owned banks, and the lists of his clients using him as an attorney. There he sat for 27 hours, looking up every name. He was able to skip a lot, which lowered his work load. He picked males under 30 and over 21, he then used bank records to see who frequently bought weapons; esteemed weapon owners. Gladly that wasn't very difficult to do, because as many as 35% of Serbians own guns. So he spent time narrowing his search;

*Who has money to spare? Who is single? Who lives farther away from the city? Who isnt as intelligent as others? No student loans, no student status, maybe living alone, no family, farmers, no copayers - no friends. No restaurant bills*

Once he was satisfied with his list he made a call, ""I have a list of 516 people. Split the load however much you want, but use those names to get my 1000 Z-19s""",worldpowers,"[ROLEPLAY] [ROLEPLAY] Yugoslav Millionaires, the Powerful 5 - Part 3; Predrag Vaso, the Fraud",https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4mf5uh/roleplay_roleplay_yugoslav_millionaires_the/

With the recent fame regarding BioFuel Gordan had lots to share. Gordan was 65 years old and had a 33 year old son. His grandchild was only 7. He lived on a modest farm in rural Serbia, Gordan didn't know what to do with all the recent earnings. He was sitting in a 45 year old recliner with 14 stacks of 100 100$ bills on the arm rest. His son, Stec, came into the room with the 7 year old. Gordan threw him 3 stacks of 10,000$ and laughed. ""Keep those.""

The child responded with a question,  ""Papa, why is there police outside? I thought you said they didn't care about us?""

Gordan opened a Beer, ""Ahhh, but you see, they care about us now, because we got something to give 'em. They want to keep their investment safe.""

""Are they the good guys now?""

Gordan looked out the window, ""There is so much needed to be fixed. This man, Stevanovic, the man who hired me, seems to have his head close to the right direction. However he is not enough to make the government the good guys just yet.""

""Why does Steva'nic want to protect you?"" The child retorted.

""Well, a year ago someone, a fucking Muslim, stole something from me, and they don't know how.""

Stec stepped In With a low voice, ""Dad please.""

""Don't please me son, those traitors have been fucking this country since our existence. I didn't fight in the 90's to have my work taken from me by those fucks years later!"" Gordan looked away and caught his breath. Now changing his attention back to his grand child he began to speak again, ""you know kid, I'll tell you why Stevanovic is a step in the right direction, because he is finishing what we started 38 years ago! He's got the Serbs from the barbarians in the north and got the Yugoslavians oppressed by inefficient rule to our south! He would be a perfect leader if he didn't forget the Croats! I swear if I had a say we would march in there and kill every one of them! And then we would kill all the heathens in Kosovo, but Stevanovic is too nice, not strong enough. Instead he is worried about MY fucking fuel.""

Stec stood up, ""Son go outside now"" He waited for the child to leave, ""Don't do that shit again, he is just a child""

Gordan got up, knocking the money off his chair, "" I have failed you my son. You should be the one preaching this to him, not me! If you see a Bosnian, Croat or Kosovon on the street I expect you to kill him right then and there, then come back a week later and piss on his grave!""

Haakon and Milo Kraz walk down the unlit hallway of the Belgrade Military Museam. Haakon dragged his finger along the glass as they walked, satisfied as a line of dustless glass appeared.

Milo spoke, ""Getting in here at night is very impressive, I didn't know you had these kind of connections, military history has always fascinated me.""

Haakon spoke in a monotone voice, ""There is much more where this came from, a key to the city, I'm in at not only Belgrade, but Skopje too. No lines, free food, late night visits 
, all yours.""

For the first time Milo looked to his left at Haakon's face, he laughed ""You want me to drop a contract at Zastava for a 'Key to a City', that's golden.""

Haakon was trying hard not to show signs of nervousness, he knew what was at stake. Milo was contracted by Serbian Railways to fabricate a meeting after the formation of Yugoslavia, that gave Serbian Railways control of Macedonian railways. Haakon knew he would be successful, he had the necessary means to fabricate a meeting, the papers, the records, and he could remove the alibis of the people involved. Haakon knew it would work and he was at risk of losing his company.

Haakon began to speak ""don't insult my intelligence, I know you want more. I have 4 million dollars ready to be transferred as we speak."" Haakon signaled for them to stop at a case containing medieval weaponry. With a 'watch this' head nudge he pulled out a key and began to open the case.

Milo refuted, ""A contract at Zastava would pay me for life, I could blow off millions on an Italian car. I need dividends, stock in your companies.""

Haakon's voice became more interested now, less monotone, ""I'll think about it."" He paused, ""Did you know my parents called themselves 'Neopagans'."" He let out a small chuckle, ""they believed that in order to show nationalism towards their country, they should go around saying they believe in Oden, and the Norse gods. Whether they ever truly believed that is a mystery, but it always stuck with me.""

Milo looked the other way, pondering the statement, ""Huh, I didn't know that.""

Haakon continued ""Many times in our household my dad would recite Norse proverbs, one that I will always remember was 'A cleaved head no longer plots'""

Before Milo had processed the statement, his lights went out. Milo's body fell to the floor. Haakon raised a war axe from the display above his head and struck down at Milo again, and again, and again. After the fourth strike Haakon let our a echoing yell traveling throughout the empty museum; he struck again, and again and again while screaming until his face turned red. He then stood up straight, dropped the axe, adjusted his collar, and made a phone call.

While autonomous states have existed before, some states had varying degree of autonomy and quit frankly wasn't very organized. This amendment gives proper nomenclature and evens the board throughout Yugoslavia. This also deals with Srpska who hasn't had a defined ""state"" throughout its existence in Yugoslavia.

The following Autonomous Yugoslav Republics are entered into the Autonomous State Assembly:

AYRM - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

AYRK - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Kosovo

AYRMO - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro

AYRH - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Herzeg

AYRB - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia

AYRS - Autonomous Yugoslav Republic of Srpska

This Autonomous Yugoslav Republics will act as states of the federal government. They must follow laws pasted by Belgrade and pay taxes to Belgrade. However, the Autonomous Yugoslav Republics also have state assemblies. They may pass laws that don't interfere with laws passed by Belgrade. At the federal level, the Autonomous State Assembly consists or representatives relative to the AYR's population. There the autonomous states may vote to bring federal level laws to the Yugoslav national assembly.

First The Marshal addresses economy growth. ""Yugoslavia has never had any period of significant economic decline  since my tenure in office. Our economy is *significantly* greater than it was 15 years ago""

Then he talks about Project Phoenix. ""Our Military infrastructure has increased dramatically. We can already produce hundreds of planes and Vehicles in a year and we dont plan on stopping. Phase 3 will expand from military to civilian factories,""

Zoran Papers and Square Train. ""These innovations have been extremely exiting for us people of Yugoslavia. We hope to propose a machine to make the Graphene substitute in a few months. The Square Train is also essential to our nation. I share the Norwegian's ambition for a Paris to Hong Kong line.""

On Srpska ""One of the darker parts of my tenure. It is important to help the region. The Independence movement is one of fools and ultra-nationalists. All conflicts in the past year have been solely in Srpska and they feel that existing on their own wouldn't make the situation much worse. It would make it much worse and the Federal Government is drafting a plan right now to help the state under Yugoslavia.""

On Foreign Affairs:

""Romania is our closest ally and we hope to make more progress in stability of the region.""

""Borislavia relations is very important to us. After the partition of Bosnia, many Serbs live in their country and many Croats live in ours. It is only natural that we improve relations with one another.""

""Bulgaria has still been hostile to our nation. We plan on detente with Bulgaria but if they dont want better relations we simply must do our best to avoid their diplomats, as every chance they get, they cause an embarrassing diplomatic situation. Take their response to our winning of the UNSC seat as an example.""

""In the little communication we have had with Greece we feel that they might be looking for detente and possibly better relations. We plan on talking with the nation.""

""As a part of CSTO our strongest ally is obviously the USSR. We plan on strengthening relations in any way we can.""

""We plan on continuing to have France our greatest trade partner, and don't see our country re-opening trade with Germany.""

""We hope that Italian-Yugoslav relations can increase. They have taken our side before and now have taken a similar immigration policy as us, and have become friendlier with the USSR. It might be easier for our administrations to work together now.""

EEA vs EEUL ""We see the EEA as a great economic alliance, and possibly a way to lessen tensions with Bulgaria and Greece. However, the primary military and defensive alliance with Romania, the East European Unity League, is also important to us and we will do our best to help with both.""

This coming year ""This year I see reforming Srpska, improving the EEA, improving economy and infrastructure, and starting detente with Greece as primary priorities.""",worldpowers,"[NEWS] The Marshal, state of Yugoslavia address and what to expect in the coming years",https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/4kqgqj/news_the_marshal_state_of_yugoslavia_address_and/

You punished people for invoking free speech. Free speech can only be lessened if ""Provoking ethnic, racial and religion based animosity and intolerance."" People speaking for free Bosnia are currently considered doing it for political, not racial reasons.

##Treason: 

###Purposeful abuse of veto power

You acted violent in an extremely quick manner so we couldn't have a say and administer a veto.

The police force acted on your orders in a manner that killed hundreds and arrested a thousand in a short time. We accuse you of trying to mobilize a group of people resembling a military.

Our stance on this is very negative. Greece was in a civil war *extremely* recently. The government claims to be different but they have declared us an enemy of the state for no reason other than them being a regime that wishes to project its power. Even if they claim to help the Albanians, their people have spoken. Albanians where slaughtered in the civil war by people who still live in the country. Greece hasn't even proposed the idea of putting Greek war criminals on trial in the ICC. Its obvious the same massacres are going to happen again if Albania is under Greek control. We ask for your opinion on the matter.

#TROOP COMPOSITION:

At the end of the 3rd Balkan War Serbia had trained 40,000 of its reserves for a year (M: 20,000 at a time, in battle posts).  When the war ended suddenly, 40,000 people just walked into a country with military grade training, leaving their jobs and lives behind. The government of Serbia decided to keep them as active, any one who decided they wanted to return home where replaced by other reserves who were trained accordingly. After accounting for deaths Serbia wielded 75,000 troops. After this training Serbia only had 120,000 reserves (Down from 170,000). In order to help pay for the new troops Serbia lowered its reserves from 120,000 to 50,000. The Srpska army consists of Bosnians who surrendered in Serbia and 9,000 Serbians in Srpska to be trained within the year.

They peacefully were let out of Yugoslavia, and when Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, we and Macedonia had the best of relations. With a minor 3 month disagreement in 2009, almost a decade ago, relations have risen higher than ever. Serbia and Macedonia has been invaded. Serbia's unsuspecting peaceful venture into Srpska met full force with Bosnia's entire military and Macedonia caught of guard by warmongering Greece. The presidents of these nations have decide to consolidate. Macedonia will act as a autonomous state in Serbia, with its legislature still standing, only giving veto power to Serbian PM. Macedonia will provide our union of countries with sufficient GDP to recover from this mess. Serbia will enforce its extensive infrastructure laws in Macedonia and Macedonia will provide the GDP, and man power necessary to come back from these series of unfortunate events. Serbia's military stands as strong as ever and we provide a prosperous environment to under go the rebuilding.",worldpowers,[EXPANSION] Yugoslavia helps a population,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/499noc/expansion_yugoslavia_helps_a_population/

The Bosnian military caught our military off guard and knocked us off our feet. But we and our allies rose up higher than before and their armies are getting hammered with one more than 4 times their size. During this conflict Bosnia has threatened Genocide towards ethnic groups. The Stevanović administration has passed laws to guarantee the rights of laborers and ethnic groups to stabilize the idea of culture in this very fragile part of the world (and stick it to the Bosnians). The Labor act aims to grant strikers the peaceful medium to do it. Strikes under 1000 people will not be forced by the government to disband. If that many people wish to strike against their employer, the employer must change. Strikers lose these rights if crimes are committed on their side. Police will only meet protestests over 1000 with nonlethal weapons. This is a response to the Belgrade shootings in 2017. Riot teams will only meet protesters in dire situations. The Ethnicity Acts plan on reinforcing Stevanović's position on the separation of culture and government, while allowing ethnicity to be  apart of everyone's lives. This act allows members of	
Hungarian, Roma, Bosnian, Croatian, Slovak, Albanian and Macedon Minorities to form a Committee of Public Wealth. Each committee will be given 1 million dollars a year to use for public works involving their culture, including festivals, museums, art, parks in local neighborhoods etc. These committees are meant to sway culture away from the national politics and into the lives of families, not nations.

This is a formulated plan, war can be avoided if Bosnia accepts the following terms:

Uphold the Dayton Agreement and **Do not** Integrate Republika Srpska, it IS autonomous. Sign a new agreement with Serbia stating you will never integrate, or remove autonomy from  the Republika Srpska. Croatia and Montenegro must sign this document as well.

Before you tell me those are wrong, I know, but I've done some of my own research and cant seem to find an answer. In the show Vikings they plan on sailing east to Russia to raid but later to England. They make a big deal about going west not east. In the show I have never heard them talk about raiding south though (I am not talking about Francia either). Then my game knowledge gets me asking questions. I am very into a game called Crusader Kings 2. From that I know that Lithuania is occupied by Romuvans and the Holy Roman Empire forms in the 900's. Did the vikings ever raid in those places? I don't want answers relating to the show or game, these where just inspiration for the question.

Bonus question: In the show the vikings always seem to win and its a bit annoying, but in the game kings and emperors are able to raise hundreds and thousands of troops.

A series of events in the month of March, 2016, led to what would go down in history as “The Legal Serbian Coup.” Mass protests started February 26th and continued for days. on March 3rd Stevanović announced online that the President of Serbia would not nominate him for Prime Minister. Two hours later a man Ognjen Marin Milojević infiltrated the protest in Belgrade and led to the death of 9 people. Protests intensified and Milojević is still on the run. On March 12th the National Assembly held an emergency meeting to help deal with the massive protests still continuing. After hours of debate 137 members of the national assembly decided to impeach president Tomislav Nikolić on the grounds of an “illegally acquired a university degree”.When it came to a vote, 113 seats in the Assembly refused to vote, they claimed the impeachment was preposterous and not to be taken seriously. This refusal to vote legally let the 137 pro-impeachment members vote for unanimous impeachment. Deputy speaker Veroljub Arsić received the presidency. As a last act of defiance the 113 anti-impeachment seats vowed to commit mutiny and not attend any Assemblies until Tomislav Nikolić was put back into power. On March 13th, 2016, acting president Veroljub Arsić nominated Željko Dražen Zlovan Stevanović for Prime Minister of Serbia. He was elected unanimously by the remaining 137 seats of the assembly and the remaining 113 Assembly members have been impeached and removed from office.

In the fired up crowd Milojević's men made their way to the roitshield blockade of police officers.

With Romania's borders closed and Germany accepting an ever high amount of refugees, the predicted number to pass through Serbia this year is 1.1 million. Serbians want action but cannot get any from the current lame duck government. They demand the emergency election to move up to as soon as possible, and they protest for the one candidate that has proposed to close Serbia's border; Željko Dražen Zlovan Stevanović.

A producer behind the Camera started counting, “five, four, three” he then went silent and made the numbers with his hands, two, one. The show commenced, a rookie news anchor named Anica began to speak.

“Welcome viewers to Serbian News, we are glad to present a very special guest, Mr. Stevanović,” she looked away from the camera to his direction, “how are you doing today?”

Stevanović began speaking comfortably, “I’m doing great Anica, how about yourself?”

“I'm excited to do this interview, I’ve been waiting all week.” she let out a casual laugh. “Now I hope my excitement doesn't lead you to believe these questions will be easy,” she grinned and let out another laugh. “We have limited time so let's get on with the questions.”

Stevanović let out his showmanship smile and said “of course!”

“Ok, you gained a lot of your initial support on online blogs and social media. Some of your critics believe that it is easy to advocate what you do, integrating Kosovo that is, on the Internet and fear that when it comes to real action, you will fall short. How would you respond?”

“Well Anica, let me explain: Kosovo experienced an extremely brutal rule under the former Yugoslavian and Serbian governments. We have Serbians detained right now, Serbians who committed atrocities against Kosovo over a decade ago. The government has yet to dish out their punishments. My first step to unifying once again would be a send the perpetrators away, forever. This swift action should help nail that decade old coffin shut. After that, I want to improve Serbia itself in such a way that Kosovo would re-enter peacefully. Money will go into education, pensions, internal improvements, welfare, and many more things. We need to give benefits to people who have never had any. Kosovo is rich in exports and holds a considerable percent of Serbia’s GDP. We simply cannot progress in a way beneficial to our nation without Kosovo. It simply cannot happen.”

“Great answer, but going back to the same topic, some people, Albanians in particular, would suggest that Kosovo should be free not because of past crimes, but because of their ethnicity. How would you counter them?”

“Ah, this question really gets to me Anica. The idea that just because you have a different ethnicity means you can just form your own country is preposterous. Countries should be ran at a government level, not an ethnic one. However, I believe everybody has their own culture, and I renounce movements to combine, or remove culture. I’m Serbian, us Serbians have food culture, languages, history, architecture; so many beautiful things makeup cultures. There are Albanians, and Croatians, there always will be. However, over the past century the world has begun to separate church and state, it's about time we separate ethnicity and state.”

“Fantastic, you answered the brunt of our questions, now before commercials we have one last one. Serbia is the biggest waystation of refugees in europe, besides Turkey of course, and experts say if Serbia shut its border, it could single handedly stunt the immigration crisis, or simply move it somewhere else, most likely Romania. Also, these facts are backed up by the fact that a second country, Croatia, has decided to close its border with us, Hungary being the first. If you where the Prime Minister, how would you deal with this problem?”


Stevanović shifted nervously in his seat. Quickly realising he slouched down he sat himself back up, adjusted his tie, and began to speak, “It is important that Prime Minister of Serbia does what is best for his country at all times. I have made promises to the Serbian people that I would give them more rights, I would put money into the general population, provide securities,” Stevanović took a moment to collect his thoughts, “We as a country simply cannot do that when there are millions of immigrants coming in and out of our country. Germany has offered to take in millions of immigrants, and they have to go through us to get there. I'm afraid our country cannot support that kind of migration if we are to prosper as quickly as I want, and promised. We need to shut our borders.”

Anica paused for a second. It is not like she didn't like the answer, it's that Stevanović has never stated his opinion on immigration and she needed a second to take it in as well. “Thank you for your time Stevanović, please come back.”

And it cut to commercials.

Željko Stevanović made his way down the hall. He began to count his footsteps as they echoed among the great arched ceiling above him. He loved the noise, a subtle clap as his shoes hit the polished floor. That was the sound of success. His expensive shoes touched the polished floors which produced a sound that bounced off of a beautifully crafted giant hallway, one that was quiet enough to let him hear. All of these things put together made Stevanović think, I’ve made it. In fact, the sound was so entrancing to him he almost crashed into the door he was walking to. Stevanović adjusted his tie, and opened the door. Once inside he made his way to a chair, sat down, and stared at President Nikolić across a desk.

“Things are proceeding as planned I assume, when will you announce your nomination?” asked Stevanović.

“I'm afraid I cannot nominate you as of this moment, for Prime Minister that is,” spoke the president, putting his hands on the desk.

“I understand you need time, but the National assembly is going to vote in less than two mon-”

“I’m afraid I can’t nominate you at all,” said Nikolić, Stevanović became silent, “ I, as the acting president, cannot nominate some random hooligan from the internet that believes he made a name for himself over the course of 2 months.”

Stevanović lunged himself from his seat “You told me if I gave a successful speech you would publicly support me! You cannot just back down.”

Nikolić shifted through papers on his desk, “ I need you to come out and oppose the passage of migrants through our coun-”

Stevanović was fired up “ are you asking me to trade a nomination for policies!? If that isn't treason I don’t know what is!”

“As you must know, 67% of citizens are for stopping immigration. Serbia is a huge waystation for them. We can make a pact with bordering countries stopping passage entirely via the Balkans. We have the chance to control one of the biggest politi-”

“I am NOT changing my campaign now! I have the support I need for reform and Kosovo integration. I am riding a train right now I will not get off until i'm the motherfucking Prime Minister of Serbia!”

The president looked down and turned the page of his notebook once again, then spoke,“I will also not hand you the nomination without a public promise to increase Presidential powers, as a way to decrease centralisation. I'm afraid without these two things you are nothing but a ant under my foot, a shit stain on the backside of this country. I will not recognize you in public, you will not get the nomination, and I will go as far as to dispel your rallies”

Stevanović picked up the pencil sharpener and through it at the wall to his left, shattering it to pieces and started shouted, “ I do not need your fucking nomination! I will cause earthquakes in this goddamn country! The assembly will have no choice but nominate me. I swear on my parent’s grave if I do not become Prime Minister, this country will face the biggest fucking mutiny this world has ever seen! I don’t need YOU.” Stevanović turned, and left.

Through a doorway, Stevanović would walk on stage, make his way to a podium, turn left, and face thousands of people. He knew he looked presentable, he stood perfectly straight at an impressive 6 foot 6 inches, and wore a 3,000$ suit, donated by supporters. Yet he felt insecure, he never expected to be giving a speech to so many people; so soon that is. Stevanović’s agent nodded her head and he started to make his way into the light, counting his paces to the podium. He made the left turn and faced thousands of faces, dead silent. To them, this was a gamble. Stevanović got lots of recognition online in the past year, but online support is faceless, spineless. These viewers came to his speech in real life, they were looking at true flesh and blood. Cameras were pointed into the crowd, no one know if they were the good guys or the bad guys; not yet. These were the people who put their reputation on the line in order to turn a fad, into a movement. 


   Stevanović adjusted his tie and began to speak, “Peace, what is peace. Some will say in a political sense, peace is the lack of war, lack of visual destruction.. However, peace is much more. In order to have peace, the population must feel peaceful. I guarantee you, if you walk down the street and ask a poor homeless man if he was at peace, he would say no. I guarantee you if you were to knock on a single mother's home, who lives paycheck to paycheck, fearing eviction, or putting food on the table, she would say no. I guarantee you that if you were to ask a Serbian who wants to see a positive change in this country, who has been fighting for change for years and years, if they were at peace, they would say no.This great nation of Serbia needs to be whole once again. We need to right our wrongs and move on, as a single country. This brings us to a topic that is commonly avoided in normal conversation, Kosovo.

Natural gases, great amounts of coal, possibility of nuclear material, you name it. Serbia committed great injustice in Kosovo, but times have changed. When i'm the prime minister, offenders will get swift punishment, they will not see the light of day for the rest of their lives, if they have one left. We will put money into war torn parts of our country, give rights to people who have never seen them. Get money to people who have never had any. We will sweep through the streets removing any hindrances to our nation. Education will skyrocket. Schools will be placed on virgin land and our country will be stable once again.

Any over-seas student who passes a basic military/shooting class will be given a Finnish Medal of Merit upon going back to his/her country. Their country can do what they want with this information.

**Nuclear Research Facility - 10km²**

""If the Courier jumps down into the lava pit, they will die before landing on the lava. The lava is flat, and landing on it is as if it were actually ground, yet the lava will still move under the body. This is more or less consistent with reality, unlike popular depictions in movies, e.g. Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, in which people falling into a lava flow sink. Lava, being molten rock, has a much higher specific gravity than a human body, so that if a human were immune to the heat so that they could stand on it, they would still not sink in it. And of course not being immune to the heat, a human would die from exposure to the intense heat at even close proximity to a lava flow, so that jumping down into a lava pit would be a guaranteed and almost instant death sentence.""
