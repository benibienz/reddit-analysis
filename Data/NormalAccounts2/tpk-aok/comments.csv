1,"&gt; The majority of racists probably voted for Donald Trump.

The problem with a statement like that is that you're just buying in to the liberal mental model of a racist. There's incredible racism in minority communities of all stripes, but the left brushes this away with their creative definitions of racism and some sort of American History X projections. 

It's unwise to confuse pandering with anti-racism. Pandering to racial groups is very racist at its core. And political parties pander. Voters don't. 

It's asinine, for instance to think that ones race or sexual preference should be so greatly predicative of one's views on foreign policy, budgets, taxes, the Constitution, etc. such that one party is grandly deserving of your loyalty and vote.  And yet Gays, Blacks, and Hispanics vote wildly for Democrats.

Because of pandering.  They've been successfully recruited through identity politics.  And part of that recruitment is making monsters out of the other party.

I personally agree with the concept that people are more fearful of others who think and act differently than them, than they are of people who look different. Culture, not Race.

And frankly identity politics just makes it seem like culture differences and racial differences largely overlap.  Which they don't need to. And when they don't you get plenty of flack from people who think race and culture and thus politics are essentially linked.  e.g. Condoleezza Rice, Thomas Sowell, Collin Powell, etc. being called horrible things akin to race traitors and worse.

If you want to play stupid word games, everything is in the past. The second you think something, do something, type something, it's a specific event in the past. 

Seriously, this is not particle physics.  I'm talking about GENRES.  Descriptive adjectives for subjective and multifaceted things that none-the-less are grouped together out of a cluster of features which makes such clustering useful.

We couldn't even KNOW what history was if we didn't have a perfect and fully known summary of all facts.

Every ""Fantasy"" game can be called alt-fantasy because there's no perfect and immutable definition for what is and what is not Fantasy.

Every ""Historical"" game can be called alt-history because there is no perfect and immutable definition for what is and what is not historical.

14,"trapÂ·pings
noun
plural noun: trappings
the outward signs, features, or objects associated with a particular situation, role, or thing.

Used popularly in Savage Worlds in references to the descriptive qualities of a mechanic that is otherwise the same. So in SW magic you have a ""bolt"" spell.  Instead of taking a DnD style tactic and having electric bolt, magic missile, fire ball, prismatic spray, etc. you take the bolt spell and then get to trap it with what's happening in qualitative terms (is it an ice spray or a fire spray or electrical or an eerie mist or an insect swarm or pages from an ancient tome that whirlwind causing damage... etc.).   But the mechanics are the same. It does the same damage, has the same range. 

In a broader sense, you could say that Submarine Drama and Space Drama are the same essential stories with different trappings... military folks trapped within a life vessel surrounded by hostile water or vacuum traveling around and interacting with ports or other vessels. Cold War implications and influences abound. 

Or that Star Wars is telling the same sort of story as Republican Rome becoming an Empire save for the trappings.

16,"Do you think something like Da Vinci Code is escapist?  
Indiana Jones? X-Files? 

Those are three where the preponderance of plot is set around real world happenings.  Da Vinci Code plays with belief and throws in some fictional connections, Indiana Jones (minus the aliens, lol, or with them) also plays with religious relics and world history and in choice spots throws in some weirdness, and while X-Files plays up the weirdness a little more, it's actually rare in this sense, the two main characters experience things which might be supernatural or might not, but even when they do such things are not supernatural-and-mundane. 

As in lizard men don't walk openly on the streets, aliens make their presence known and are hovering over all the major cities, technology or whatever is not accessible by the two leads. 

The natural order, the existing paradigms of life are not overthrown. 

And, because of this, all 3 would be better modeled as a game by GURPS than DnD, for example.

Or Deadlands vs. more natural Old West.  Throw in some weirdness to make up for the fantasy ... so you get weird science and monsters and several forms of magic more or less themed to the era... magical healing to keep it playable, etc.

20,"&gt; Another possibility would be to reduce the scope of your game.

That's fully in line with the idea of a campaign. It's not necessarily as far as you suggest where you design the game to be a specific scope ... say ""Dinner Party in Venice"" where you have to use courtly intrigue to unravel a conspiracy against the Doge all over the course of an upper crust masked ball. 

But it could also be, say a Crusades Game. And instead of just releasing a Crusades Splat Book that includes lots of tables and info-dump... instead there's a Crusade setting so you CAN craft your own stories... but there's also a robust campaign that is written around a Crusade that starts in Europe and travels to the Middle East along the crusader route or the pilgrim routes and you have adventures along the way ... maybe rail roady, maybe a little more choose your own adventure (I mean there's only so many ways to get to the Levant from Europe) ... that would allow the GM to run the game and have just enough information at their finger tips to not have to earn a BS History just to manage.

Of course this isn't sandbox 1100 AD but if you want sandbox, you're also willing to do the work for that and this product would help but obviously would require your own supplementation. 

I'd like to capture both, people who want some resources to sandbox, and people who would totally play ""Gladiator"" or ""Ben Hur"" or ""Genghis Khan"" or ""Civil War"" if only the work burden were limited and they could plug and play, so to speak, a campaign.

Ok so in your parlance there's ""Renaissance"" that's not historical ... ok. Fine. 

So include those games in the original question. Why do people shy away from those? Why are they not as popular as they are in other gaming genres?  Why?  What would make those games attractive? ",2016-11-08 10:56:05+00:00,d9qwpzx,12.0,t1_d9qw7ut,1733.0,rpg
22,"&gt; But okay, if you call that a setting, let's call a description of what events happened in the world and what the world around the PCs look like a âhistorical and geographical backgroundâ (HGB). You can play a fantasy game (or any other genre: cyberpunk, space opera, Renaissance, medieval, modern, contemporary, etc.) without a premade HGB, and just make it up during the game.

Sure, a HGB. And that would be part of the initial question... specifically if you're going to design a campaign you would include an abbreviated HGB that would be relevant to the events and locations and tasks that are a part of that adventure series.

As opposed to an AP European History Course.  For example, if we wanted to explore political intrigue in Renaissance Italy, we would sketch out the relevant political factions and families giving more attention to the ones figuring in our plot.  We wouldn't need to wax poetic on every dynasty and family connection or dozens of years of intermarriage history, but the current generation of alliances and power brokers would be good to know.

A Cliff's Notes to world history sufficient to run the adventure.  And of course being real history or predominantly such, if the players jump tracks and go off on a tangent, the GM can respond if they need to by researching for ideas in that area.  

For instance, the Borgias are Spanish and moved in to Italian politics via the church and worked to place their patriarch as the Pope... and did.  The players might be tasked by other Italian power families to undermine Borgia influence.  If they stay in Italy, the plot would have what they need to identify other power brokers to use.

But let's say they take a radical strategy not considered in the plot... hey, let's actually go back to Spain and undermine their support there, forcing them to retreat back to their base of power and weaken their hold on Italy.   Well, you could use real history sources to provide you with details.

But the ""Stabbey Stab Stab Some Italian Stuff and Popes and Stuff"" game would come with a plot and sufficient information to reasonably navigate that world.  Just like a well made Dragonlance module will include the same sort of information. 

The most successful or prolific historical alt-hist or whatever publisher seems to me to be GURPS.  And they don't publish plots.  They give well researched books but they don't hold your hand in a way that I contend would make people who don't play historical-esque for reasons that they feel under-equipped to do so.

24,"&gt; In this case, would you call Shellshock a historical game?

Reading it over briefly, it's a war simulator. There's nothing in the game that would prevent it, as written, from running any degree of historical game, from some strict sense down through the most alt-of-alt history.

There's also nothing inherent in the game that I've seen that necessitates it be called fantasy. Although it doesn't preclude that because it seems more descriptive of the commonalities of WAR versus setting or tools (guns vs. spells?).  

This is compounded by the predominantly historical war images used, the references for books and music listed.  That also includes some token future sci-fi. 

But all of this still makes things such as Fantasy a distinction without a difference.  If you want to play fantasy with this, but it doesn't account for magic differently or races differently, there's no such thing as class or level or whatever... then it's just mood.  Like historical would be mood. 

From what I'm reading, this game would play the same if you have Romans. Or Romans with guns.  Or Romans with guns riding on dragons shooting spells, because all those things are just descriptors, trappings. 

The marketing of this game as is, appears to be much more in line with predominantly past historical warfare fluff. Allows for future warfare. Weirdness and Fantasy and whatever are tangential, so you could have them or not, no big deal.

But you don't need to be fantasy to be generic. In fact what sort of game do you even envision here?  We're playing Fantasy!  Ok go.... well what sort of magic do we have access to?  What sort of weapons do we have access to?  What races are there? What are the monsters like? What are the politics like?

You start answering those questions and you've de facto created a setting.

Fantasy has the attractive quality that you can establish monsters which you can kill without much moral quandary. This is not so easy in more historical settings that don't include aliens or monsters or weirdness.  I'd contend that we've replaced monsters with Nazis and Zombies (or Zombie Nazis) to fill this gap.  At least for the games that appeal to hack and slash. 

No one really has a moral crisis over slaughtering Nazis. More than any other example I can think of, they've become the human-monster-target.

Even when we don't have Nazis to kill, popular historical roleplaying settings do tend towards those without significant moral repercussions for vigilante justice or worse.  Like the Old West.  

But of course murder-hobo slaughter fests aren't the only style of play.  And intrigue and politics are more interesting when you make just killing people in the open to solve problems harder.

Most techniques require metal working tools, but this is not insurmountable, there are maker spaces and metal shops you should be able to get access to.  The right tools make the product so much better and the process easier. 

For instance, you really should size the ring correctly.  A ring mandrel or a stepped ring mandrel would allow you to shape and size the ring correctly. $30 or you can bribe your nearest metal smith or jeweler to use their tools and have them show you how to use them, lol.

36,"&gt; You can play a crunchy game in a historical setting, or a rule-light game in a fantasy setting.

You can. But in general the more fantasy elements the more crunch to adjudicate them and explain them and the more options and special rules, etc.

Fantasy settings typically have many elements that lead to higher page counts for both fluff and crunch.

&gt; How is that related to the discussion?

It's a response to the claim that with historical you HAVE to have a setting whereas with fantasy you don't, you can play in generic fantasy setting.  Well you can play in generic historical setting, too.

If generic fantasy has all the spells and options but isn't tied in with a story, so too is tech level a measure that shows what technology is available without being specifically tied to any culture or need for history fluff. ",2016-11-08 05:53:01+00:00,d9qqe2h,6.0,t1_d9q62gb,28550.0,rpg

39,"Sure, you can play without a pre-made setting, but that doesn't circumvent my point.  Even without the fluff burden for a setting, Fantasy is generally also the largest burden for crunch, special mechanics, skill trees, class options, etc.

And if you play a system like GURPS, you can play historical-esque in the exact same way as Fantasy without a setting, using Tech Level.  Tech Level encompasses the sort of kit and weapons and such that would be available to you, and it doesn't necessitate any sort of setting.

E.G.  You find yourself awake in a strange place, you are in a courtyard adjacent to an arena that has a magic sign that changes its text.  After a while several minutes of scripts you've never seen before it reads: ""Welcome to the galactic showdown. You will fight to the death in our arena. Grab your weapon and enter now!"" 

And if you wanted a medieval style conquest you'd have TL 3 (let's say, I don't have my book at hand to get the exact number).  If you wanted Renaissance, TL 4.  Future laser weapons TL 8 (for example, numbers made up).

Not really.  The game itself attracts styles of play.  When you develop a world with monsters and more black and white morality, you attract murder hobos. 

Hey lets go hack and slash and dungeon delve.

Fine.  But if your world doesn't drop gold and goodies and the people are people not monsters and the morality isn't good versus evil so running around murdering stuff is not trivial and unnoticed in the setting... you get a different style of play.

The diversity of experience with DnD and Pathfinder is not nearly as diverse and creative as the sorts of games being run in Savage Worlds and GURPS.  For obvious reasons.  And it's not just the people.  It's the design of the game.

Um, you're really talking about a different concept. More like ""cinematic vs. realistic"" or how simulationist you want to be.

Throwing in Elves and Magic doesn't magically make an RPG cinematic... you can absolutely do boring things like you're suggesting in a fantasy setting.

I mean heck, one of the biggest nonsense handwaving aspects of the fantasy genre is the dungeon crawl.  They make little sense. Hey, here's his amazingly constructed underground area where you can kill stuff room by room and all these weird life forms are just sort of hanging around... like do they have jobs? Do they clock in to wander the halls?  Do they have a union? LOL.

If you don't want to role play taking a dump in a fantasy game, you don't have to. Just like you don't have to role play that in a game set in Republican Rome.  

You want to ""fast travel"" in Fantasy. You can ""fast travel"" in historical.

That's not unique to Fantasy though.  I don't think anyone runs around diligently calling their games alt-Fantasy or alt-Forgotten Realms just because they play in them versus... something more radical like restructuring the reality of an entire swath of the world. 

&gt; If the characters are not involved in important events, then it's fine.
&gt; Just don't let them meet the big boss, or history might be changed.

I just don't know a single game that would preclude this. It's really not important.  At all.  Because these are issues that no setting could prepare for, and the reason there's a GM in the first place.  Publishers put out modules and campaigns and yet every one of them really has to allow for the chaos of players meeting them. Else it's a script and not a game.  I mean I guess technically someone could publish a campaign that would be uber rigid but it would also then be unplayable. 

So moot point.

45,"Perhaps here's merit in separating the concepts of

Historical Fiction.
Alternate History.
and 
Historically inspired (re-skinned).

So I'd revise my statement that we necessarily are running historical fiction.  I'd reserve alternate history to this concept, stolen from wikipedia: 

""According to Steven H Silver, an American science fiction editor, alternate history requires three things: a point of divergence from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing; a change that would alter history as it is known; and an examination of the ramifications of that change""

To me, you can hand wave gender and say that it just doesn't matter. This would NOT be examining the ramifications of that change. I'd argue that in doing so you've maintained H-fiction but you're not really wandering into Alt-H because you've created fiction but you're not letting the ripples of that choice rework all the other aspects of the world that would then make it different. 

For instance, if we had women soldiers and women clergy in 1200 Europe, for sure their influence would change other policies. The concept of family and law and inheritance and all these other things would go through a revolution and be different. 

Or we could say, I'd rather not antagonize my female players with having to cross play their characters and so we will simply take that conflict off the table and make it moot.

Much like Deadlands made slavery moot.  It didn't just resolve slavery.  It also removed Reconstruction and Jim Crow and the profound racism, etc.  It's just not something fun to play while we play cowboys and ... err... Native Americans...

&gt; They just called Venice ""Glantri"".

From looking at this, it's re-skinned Venice, an obvious inspiration, but this is all over all of Fantasy whose base is medieval Europe. 

And I doubt that Glantri includes more than the architecture and landscape ... for instance, the humans of Venice and the family houses, the Doges and their political alliances and the realities of being on Earth versus a fantasy continent in a fantasy world. 

But the preponderance of elements clearly designates the game as Fantasy.  Western and Victorian share a huge swath of time, space, tech, but the themes are often used to distinguish one from the other.  Penny Dreadful has both. It also has horror. But if we had to choose, the algorithm would spit out Victorian Horror vs. Western. ",2016-11-07 15:30:55+00:00,d9pmmsy,8.0,t1_d9pjn6c,4297.0,rpg
46,"Well, it's weakly historical because they have actual historical items in the game. Horses are historical. Carts are historical. Crossbows and swords are historical. 

There's no reason to invoke what is essentially the Ship of Theseus Paradox (how many items can we replace before the whole isn't the whole any more) to figure this out.  

I can call my cat a black cat because it's predominantly black. Does it cease to be black when it's out in the sun for 10 minutes and the radiation slightly lightens the coat to a different shade of black?  What about the eyes which are not black? etc.

There's little reason to have a semantics debate over where the line between Scientific and Science Fiction is, and where's the line between that and Fantasy, and what if you have something historical in there... oh no ... meh.  

Again, there's not a game I can think of that is pure history. You can not create a game out of such. The game itself is an abstraction and an abstraction that selectively acknowledges a subset of the reality and the second you play it's alt in some manner. 

What's a western? What's a drama?  What's a thriller?  What's horror?  ... just semantics and philosophy of naming and categorization.

There are interesting and compelling and fun stories to be had without crypto-fantasy which is what that manifesto is referring to. 

Consider the gender issue similar to the universal translator issue.  It's a consession made to remove an element of game play that is more likely to be tedious than interesting.  OF COURSE you can write drama around historical gender rolls and the inability to easily and efficiently and accurately communicate... I do believe there's a female scientist trying to talk to a new alien species movie coming out soon.

But if that's not where you want to provide the axis of drama, you hand wave it so it doesn't become an issue you're not interested in talking about or exploring. ",2016-11-07 14:51:49+00:00,d9pky6y,6.0,t1_d9ph4td,6549.0,rpg
48,"&gt; I still don't understand why changes to gender roles and health are viewed ok, but changes to magic aren't.

Health and Gender issues are modifications to ease game play. Abstractions as accommodating to enjoyment as much as not having to track your bowel movements and make rolls for them, not tracking time in real time, not gaming the most boring and trivial aspects of your character's life.

We already make thousands of these accommodations mostly unnoticed.  And the answers are often easy and trivial.  The only reason the gender issue came up is because someone said that they'd shy away from historical because of it... but one answer is obvious... just make it a non-issue and move on.  Just like DnD did not get ruined when we stopped applying a mechanical penalty to female characters' STR score. 

It existed, then it didn't.  It wasn't an important part of the abstraction for people who didn't want it to be and just like that it's not longer an issue.

Playing historical doesn't mean you have to go 1800s House and make your characters do laundry and dishes for 80% of the day or till their fields, die of consumption, and what not.

Magic is adding something that doesn't exist and didn't exist. It's a profoundly different set of realities.  It's as off base as saying ""why aren't you adding space ships to your Renaissance game?""

Sure, any change you make, any abstraction can change things. But it's much easier to say that gender is irrelevant than it is to say Magic is universal without reworking the entirety of the culture.

Perhaps your confusion is stemming from the assumption that this would be run in a system that is built around magic like DnD or Pathrinder. Well no. It's much more suited to GURPS or Savage Worlds or any of the systems that aren't assuming magic and super powers as intrinsic instead of modular.

49,"&gt; a) History
&gt; b) Alt-history

As I stated elsewhere, I think these are a distinction without a difference in the frame of an RPG.  I can't think of a single RPG that would be called History once players are allowed to do anything, to roll dice, as doing so would necessarily go against what happened in reality.

Sort of like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can't play in history, it's past and the book is closed. Any game would necessarily alter the state by the observance of play. 

This doesn't preclude the spectrum of just how alt- we're getting. We can have significantly alt where we have a huge book of new fiction that we've tacked on to an otherwise historical (accurate) setting.  Deadlands... it's history as lived to a point and then boom, we introduce weirdness and redraw the map and remove slavery and break down expectations that would limit women characters. 

Or any number of _insert apocalypse here_ settings.  Or _add Cthulhu to history_ settings.  Those introduce a non trivial bit of alternate-ness. 

I guess a game that was set in say a Roman gladiator school would technically be alt- but if the drama and action were all contained within a certain box and that box didn't have consequences which changed the timeline for major events... it's not very alt.  Still fiction. Still a game.  Still a modicum of alt.  But alt without a difference. 

Again, I can't think of a History game then. Just low-alt games.   Any examples? ",2016-11-07 14:19:27+00:00,d9pjne6,6.0,t1_d9ph4td,4607.0,rpg
50,"&gt; but that's not historical.

Meh, a distinction without a difference.  The second you drop your players in to Forgotten Realms, and they roll dice, you've changed that setting. It doesn't cease to be fantasy or Forgotten Realms.  It just ceases to be a platonic ideal as published by someone else.

Similarly, there is no such thing as a Historical RPG the second you allow players to make a choice and roll dice, because by necessity they have then done things that were not done in history.

So no, I'm not sure there's any value in talking about your concept of historical, it's a non-starter.  At best it simply exists within the range of possibilities that one might play... you'd say ""we're playing history with the realities as we know them intact.""  Which is fine, but you're also playing a game that has a system and randomness and uncertainty. 

And of course what we ""know"" about history is imperfect, incomplete, and filtered through other cultures and people with agendas, biases, and a lot of gaps. 

Historical is a complex and subjective adjective, not a state, like ""historically accurate"" would be.

&gt; So you might want to change the post title to Would a detailed campaign make seemingly-Historical more attractive?

Not really, because I can't think of a single RPG that would meet your concept of historical. The book is necessarily closed on that.",2016-11-07 14:11:26+00:00,d9pjcb4,4.0,t1_d9phm3w,3098.0,rpg
51,"&gt; The interest in playing historical battles lies in ""what if there had been a different general leading the forces?""

That's not re-enactment then, as I'm using the word, specifically because it's not railroaded and immutable. 

The difference between role playing parts and acting in a play with a script.  The second is re-enactment (albeit for fiction vs. historical).

Diplomacy, Civilization, etc. are not re-enactment. 

&gt; In a historically accurate setting, instead, the players cannot get rid of Hitler, because World War II will happen due to his actions.

But there's no such thing as that setting because the characters didn't exist or if they did, you're right back in to scripted re-enactments.  No one plays this. It's just not even a thing.  

At best, you might have things the GM decides they are not interested in altering. But whatever, that's GM fiat and exists in any setting. 

There's nothing in a totally fantasy setting preventing players from say, tracking down a major figure, killing them, burning a kingdom to the ground, and then some future published campaign includes those places or people, because the company is publishing their official history. 

The setting isn't really any less historical if you allow the players to kill Hitler or not in the sense that you are setting your game with the technology level of that time, with the politics of that time, with the conflicts of that time... broad strokes of setting and culture.

The choice of players or GM to go and put their finger on things that they know in real life to be true or not is a different aspect.  Essentially, all historical becomes alt-historical the second you insert your players and they roll dice. 

But the degree of alt-history is variable.  When you go back to say the Renaissance and then introduce a Zombie Apocalypse, it's still historical, but of course you've reduced the reality of that time period in a major way with zombies... instead of a minor way with inserting your characters in to situations where there were no such people.

Frankly, killing Hitler and finding out what happens in the aftermath would be a great game. Even outside of RPGs this is a popular thought experiment around ethics and time travel, and theories of history and determinism.  Do we believe in the Great Man Theory of history or the Zeitgeist Theory... would dumping Hitler prevent the war or simply delay or change how it unfolded?  Did we need Lincoln or were the issues of the civil war coming to a head no matter what and the resolutions likely similar regardless of one man.  Etc.

As a GM I'd be open to both letting the players make the ALT in history really pronounced or in letting them shake up their own worlds but not necessarily using outside knowledge of history to metagame a result.  

For instance, when would an American know that they needed to kill Hitler?  The horrors of the death camps, etc. weren't really part of the pre-war and early war understanding. 

Do you kill Hitler after he wins political election?  Do you kill him after Germany invades the low country? France? etc. etc.  

If we didn't structure our game as some sort of time travel affair, no one would know to strangle him in his crib, so to speak. ",2016-11-07 14:03:24+00:00,d9pj1kz,6.0,t1_d9phu6u,2174.0,rpg

Savage Worlds is not very munchkiny.  I think it's a better compromise than more wishy washy systems that say they don't have complications because they lack crunch for a lot of things, but really they just make deciding mundane things harder. 

When someone asks, I want a new system that's easy to learn, cheap to get in to, and plays fast with fast prep, SW is what I recommend. It has enough crunch to actually be a game instead of just cooperative talking and not enough to make being a new player a big disadvantage.

Not really. It's still roleplaying, not re-enactment. History is the setting, not the play requirement.  Just like you can play MERP and not diddle around the Shire the whole time or live like any other peasant who has no access to wealth, adventure, magic, the lure of historical isn't academic, it's thematic. 

Magic being out doesn't make it mundane (as in lacking interest or excitement; dull), it makes the sort of challenges you can present to players different and interesting when there isn't a spell to make it go away.

Learned this the hard way one of my first times DMing.  My plot involved the PCs getting shipwrecked on a desert island and the impetus for them to go exploring was food and water.  Well, mage casts protection from food and hunger and they all sat on the beach with no reason to do anything but wait for rescue. 

Heck, just look at other forms of entertainment like films.  High Fantasy is the most popular RPG genre but the films? Precious few. Most are horrid.  All the DnD themed films were horrid. And the best of course exist based on material pre RPGs, LOTR. 

And when you think about it, Magic his highly limited in LOTR.  Gandalf is not blasting spells every round. There are a book of plot holes that exist when you start asking, why didn't Gandalf just cast ___ or why didn't ____ .  

And I'd go further and say that you're wrong in general about historical in all gaming.  Historical as you seem to envision it would preclude gaming, because it'd preclude the fiction.  Sure, historical miniatures players might like accuracy but there's no reason PLAY out historical battles because the uncertainty and choice make it a game instead of a re-enactment.  If it's limited to re-enactment, there's no reason to play it.  You can just talk about it. 

Historical gaming is not to see what it would have been like in the past, it's to use the past as setting for types of challenges that are most interesting to play in that setting.

61,"&gt;  For me, the creativity sort of dies when you call it ""historical"". Roleplaying is about creating a new story, which is easier to do in a new place with new rules.

Sure, but just like The Western became the NEW uniquely American landscape to tell stories... it got stale.  Vanilla is delicious but when it becomes the default for decades, there are more _different_ sorts of stories to tell. 

There's nothing wrong with tropes, but when they become cliche and then tired, because the same tools to play with lead to the same challenges... you change up the tool-set. 

I don't see a lot of creativity coming out of fantasy. It's sort of like oooh, that's FRENCH Vanilla! Totally different than Vanilla. 

Well, where's the Rocky Road?  Where's the Strawberry?  Where's the Cookies and Cream? 

When you strip it down, as a PC you can talk to people and damage people. And GMs throw people at you to create conflicts.  I don't see how any type of genre is necessarily less creative or interesting to do those sorts of things.  Magic, for all it's magesty, becomes just another technique.  And a lot of fantasy games... it's boring as hell. The magic has left magic, it's not magical, it's just another sort of DPS strategy. And races are sort of monolithic monoculture stereotypes. Etc. 

And in that regard, I see a lot more creativity happen outside of fantasy.

Consider police procedurals on TV. They all run together now because there's only so many stories to tell about big city cops and district attorneys. Every once and a while you'll get The Wire or The Shield, but on the daily shows, it's all the same.

62,"&gt; b) Power levels. By playing a historical scenario we would be implicitly agreeing to play normal people. Unfortunately, normal people get hurt really easily. My group enjoy playing heroes with some degree of immunity to death.

Also clearly another valid concern.  Depends on how the system handles death and how lethal you want the feel. 

""Realistic"" settings like GURPS have a cinematic ruleset that allows for differences here.

Savage Worlds isn't super lethal, even without magical healing. Regular mundane healing helps.

And it's also one thing that I think if you're in a more lethal system ... the one fudge I'd make is to allow for limited cinematic healing to replace magical healing. 

Other consideration is that with more historical, you're also not subjecting your players to lethal magic in return. ",2016-11-07 06:48:34+00:00,d9p9w1h,2.0,t1_d9ojxip,38048.0,rpg
63,"&gt; a) The role of women. 

This is a good concern for certain types of games. Not one that I think would be a deal breaker though. And not just in the ""we'll find an interesting way for a woman to be a character"" way... but just flat out hand wave it.  

I don't think, for instance, that having a WWII squad that now has female troops would break the world to bits.  And this is an example where women were specifically and almost universally absent in history.  We don't NEED the women to only play a nurse or intelligence operative or what other sorts of female roles that existed in numbers.

Versus say, the general mistaken impression that women weren't in positions of power and interest in history. That can be solved by simply pointing them out and highlighting them.  If you wanted to run a political intrigue game in Machiavelli's Italy, there are plenty of women who were movers and shakers and places like Florence were much more cosmopolitan than say the internal Vatican power structure. 

But even then.  You want a female who wants to play a cardinal and a female one at that... boom... that exists now.  Still might make drama out of it if that's interesting, but the sort of history I would be interested in is less ""you can't do that and we must re-enact"" and more ""these are the sorts of technologies and interests and tools available to us to create a story.""

So there were female pirates. And Jewish pirates. And Black pirates. So you sort of have a choice if you want to antagonize your female, Jewish, Black characters or players for that or not.  That takes a simple conversation at the outset of the campaign to set expectations and then a check in to make sure that the sorts of drama you're creating are interesting to resolve for your players. 

Deadlands takes slavery right off the table. Fine choice. But one where you could easily choose not to and have that still be a thing. And it might be fun and interesting. 

Part of I think any RPG is NOT putting PCs ""in their place"" historically or thematically or within the social order of the game. Almost all games seek to violate these constraints but not remove them entirely because they you just have a Monty Hall game or murder-hobo game where there's just no limitations or accountability or anything to stand up to players... and that gets old fast.

Similarly, would it be any less fun to play:
- A mafia game where there were female capos and Godmothers? Not that I can tell.  Heck, if they want to run male prostitutes, what's the harm?

- A female James Bond?  Don't see any problem with that.

- Female clergy, female warriors, and female rulers in a Crusades game.  Why not? 

Not only can you recognize women in power for what they historically were, you can also have notable women exceptions, or you can hand wave it entirely.  

Brienne of Tarth as a warrior, the Red Priestess as a sorcerer, Cersei as Queen, etc. don't ruin the historical aspects of that Fantasy property... so do we really think that Joan of Arc and Queen Elisabeth, etc. would be out of place or if we turned up the female representation more?  

Consider what HBO's Rome, The Borgias, Da Vinci's Demons, etc. did with historical, making it historical fiction, and having interesting and varied roles for women.

And we need not stop there, we could go further, but keep the majority of the historical elements we like.

Heck, you could simply ask... hey, we have half female players and they want to play female characters, does anyone mind if they get to play all the same roles that men would without penalty? So even though _in ""real"" life_ we would likely not have fair standing between an average female and average male in hand to hand armored combat... we don't need to create franken-woman ... we just decide that women and men can play those roles according to their character sheets, so if the woman puts more points in fighting and strength, she's got a better chance to win.

I remember the days when females got their -2 STR ... and sure you can argue that's realistic or not... but I don't know anyone who thought that was _fun_.  So we didn't use it. 

Dogs in the Vineyard could have been jumped on by the current strain of SJW feminist outrage brigade for any number of sins. Cultural appropriation. Religious stereotype and fundamentalism. But even with that sort of controversial potential, the game said that Women Dogs were just fine. 

I think allowing women to exploit historical feminine advantages and not be restricted by historical boundaries is just fine. And almost any historical setting wouldn't be unwound by letting that happen, especially if you just talk with your players at the start. 

A female normalized Pope could be interesting. So could a female posing as a male Pope.  And right there you have a whole adventure plot that still gives agency to female players and characters with and without setting validation of such.

64,"I agree that's a popular sentiment.

To me, though, after you take some classes in economic theory and development and such, you can't help but look at a lot of medieval + magic fantasy with a real skeptical eye.

Specifically how unrealistic these cultures are given the profound technology of magic.  They just would not operate that way any more. Magic would fundamentally re-structure all parts of society.  

I mean consider what the Conquistadors did with a handful of men and horses and guns. Those two bits of technology completely eclipsed the traditional power structure of the Americas. 

There are dozens of spells in the typical fantasy spell book that would be like introducing the nuclear bomb to the Crusades.

Sure, it's a heady and easy to dismiss concern, but once you see what humans did over minor little differences like church doctrine... when people appeared that could do magic, I think you'd expect more story lines like what happens in X-men than what happens in most Fantasy. 

There'd be purges and inquisitions and the extant powerful would do anything they could to either capture or suppress magic. 

There'd also be various industrial revolutions of profound effect.

Not that Guns, Germs, and Steel or whatever would make the best campaign book ... but I think I've outgrown the suspension of disbelief required to accept standard fantasy as the system I want to enjoy the most.  ",2016-11-07 05:41:37+00:00,d9p84a3,2.0,t1_d9ox88u,16652.0,rpg

67,"&gt; You might compare this to how the Japanese animation industry took decades to throw off their Disney roots before really doing work that was unique and well outside the Disney realm
&gt; To make the comparison more direct than you intended, I could comment that much of the staples of anime and manga are fantasy, and most of the non-fantastic stuff is contemporary.

Yeah, I can see this.  What came to my mind when I wrote the top sentence was Graveyard of the Fireflies.  It's a gripping and tragic emotional story, but the character art is still clearly under the style of Disney. 

It's almost incongruous and at odds, style vs. content.  Sure, Disney has done some dark stuff, but you mostly walk away not traumatized.  Bambi and Dumbo have some dark scenes... but that's not really the impression.   

GotFF ... jebus.

&gt; Speaking of popular genres in Japan, that reminds me of the extreme shortage of sports-themed RPGs. Whenever the subject gets brought up, I groan at the narrow-mindedness

Wow. I hadn't even THOUGHT of this glaring hole in the genre offerings.  Didn't even cross my mind. But a perfect example of ... well why not? 

In my examination of historical, I looked at Civilization games and Risk and Diplomacy and such and said.... people don't give one bit about playing historical and rewriting history at all.  They are not bound at all in any of those games to not take the Incas to space or have Italy win WWI in a solo victory, etc.

People love sports management games.  And I don't see why I couldn't want to write a Byzantine politics game and think that politics and national level intrigue could be fun... and deny that Any Given Sunday the RPG couldn't be very much the same sort of rolls and plots and interest but with a football theme vs. a religious city state theme. 

Heck, I've run a Gladiator school game. That's trivially different than a sports franchise game. ",2016-11-07 05:16:02+00:00,d9p7caf,4.0,t1_d9oryn0,22447.0,rpg
68,"&gt; ""The time around 1950 is the only time when comic books were a normal medium.""
&gt; American comics of that era were full of crime and detectives, war, Westerns, romance, horror..

Yes, and it's interesting how Supers were presented in film over time as well.  The Superman and Batman films and TV shows and how in many ways they initially were styled after the comics.

Comics made certain decisions based on the limitation of the medium.  Like bold blocky color choices. So you might read Dick Tracey and think, hey, this is slightly exaggerated from real gangsters. The colors are more technicolor because who wants to have everyone on the page be shades of black, grey, and dark blue suits.

So the comic is an abstraction of reality. Then we get a Dick Tracey movie where all the exaggerations from the comic are compounded instead of rolled back. So it looks like Who Framed Roger Rabbit instead of something gritty and serious.

Same with Batman.  We know why comics pick unitard outfits that are big blocks of color. But then Batman TV looks like a leotard/pajamas fest. 

Superman 1980s, rather the same. Campy.  Because of course, comics are campy and juvenile (not really, but you know the stereotype) so film needs to be that way too.  Even the Keaton stuff and later suffered from camp. 

It wasn't really until Nolan decided that you could re-skin the visual to be more in line with modern aesthetics.... and better printing technology also meant that comics themselves could be less 4 color. 

As for RPGs, I think we are in the era that is still under the shadow of DnD. It's changing, but it's still the largest piece of the pie by far.  And that's good, who wants an industry that's failing.  But I think there's a lot more types of flavor that RPGs can tackle and we don't need most games to be thinly reskinned DnD.

69,"Pirates of the Spanish Main is a good example. It really only happened because GW/Pinnacle was contracted to expand an existing IP for a tabletop strategy card game in to an RPG.  So it goes with the notion that historical is more well established in other gaming genres.

Two, it's not supported any more. Obviously because the license lapsed and it ran its course.

Three, I'd love to see more games like this though. 

Four, Pinnacle has made rather different choices in their own properties regarding historical. Specifically the significant injection of weirdness that sort of trumps the historical concerns.

Their own 50 Fathoms is a good helping of fantasy. Weird Wars introduce monsters which preserves the sort of murder hobo dynamic where players get to kill things with abandon because they're non-human.

In a lot of ways this refuses historical sensitivities and introduces less morally ambiguous means to kill stuff to have fun.  Deadlands stalls out the Civil War and ends slavery just so those uncomfortable issues are taken off the table.  A valid choice, but one which another game could easily exploit for drama and interest instead.

An underground railroad game might be fascinating.

And consider historical settings that would not include an Arcane Background.  Or if they did it'd be much more limited and secretive.  There are a lot of ""historical"" type properties that do introduce a little bit of the supernatural.  X-files.  Religious horror.  

I mean, the priests don't run around casting magic missile, but they can perform an exorcism. Or they can lay on hands when the plot needs a little insta-healing.  You know, moderate stuff that's very situational and very limited, and when it comes out it's for effect.

70,"&gt; Fun over Historical Accuracy in the end

Yeah, that's the obvious priority.  While some historophiles might love reading up on the minutiae, I think the appeal of historical is that it's often stranger than fiction, it's well fleshed out and accessible, and epic stuff happened.  More over, there are easy to grasp but wildly different lifestyles than we have now.

Just consider how filled your mind becomes with atmosphere with each of these:

Pirates!

Rome! 

Cold War! 

Old West!

But I could spit out a dozen fantasy realms and if you haven't read the books... you have no idea what the flavor is.  ",2016-11-07 04:26:42+00:00,d9p5li4,2.0,t1_d9os6ax,19187.0,rpg
71,"Well, in other gaming styles players don't generally have any problem re-writing historical events.  Take Diplomacy.  That's a well structured game which uses all the nationalism and war from WWI to its advantage but it derails true history from the first move.  No one is all too concerned in playing that if Austria and Turkey form an alliance and clear out France and England. 

And on a smaller scale, think about Hunt for Red October.  That didn't change the cold war, but it was still a thrilling story set within historical events that gives the player agency and is still thrilling.  And sure, they could fail and the Russians launch a nuke. Then there would be more serious alt-history than simply helping a Russian captain defect. 

Or Master and Commander.  That didn't change the Napoleonic Wars, but it was thrilling and fun and filled with historical consideration.

X-Files didn't undo the 1990s even with the injection of a limited amount of weirdness.  

James Bond had tons of fun dealing with government interests but again his success or failure didn't have to be directly involved with the ability to majorly re-write world events.  He still had plenty of agency for epic cinematics. 

Assassin's Creed doesn't upend the Crusades or Renaissance Italy or the French Revolution.

So I think for Historical I'd mean more historical settings vs. anything like re-enactment of big battles or what not where players know the outcomes and would feel compelled to only do what has been done. 

Even if you touched real stuff, say D-Day, I'd want my players to be a special ops squad on a secret mission that has to be inserted with the landing on D-Day but their mission isn't to take the beach and hang out... they need to use the invasion as cover and get behind German lines and then go do ____ .... so all the excitement and danger and carnage of D-Day but something more. Something off-script... their goals would not be ""make D-Day happen like it did"" it would be more D-Day is the decoration around which you're having this other adventure. 

That way players could research D-Day if they wanted for ideas and flavor, but they wouldn't have to worry about being too on rails. ",2016-11-07 04:01:09+00:00,d9p4ltu,2.0,t1_d9ou78g,14876.0,rpg
72,"Exactly. I mean I've always found fantasy intimidating for the same reason that I think people find historical intimidating.  How much about, say, Forgotten Realms do I really need to know to play in this game... the DM has read two dozen books set in that realm and I don't have any of them... and it's not as if there's ample free resources to go learn what I might want or need to know, like there is for anything historical.

Nor am I in any position to bring something new to the game by finding something the DM doesn't know.

This is easy in historical.  I'm playing a 1890s surgeon... I can go research what sorts of drugs they might have used for surgery and could then say my character has ready access to ether which I can use to knock enemies out.  etc.

73,"I agree that that's the perception. (1) Most of what people know about real world history are huge events that are typically so much larger than one person or a group and are ""set in stone. (2) Magic makes people think they can do massive things.

In practice, though, I've found that most Fantasy games don't do crap as far as a global scale of huge events. Dungeon crawling is rarely epic. Saving a town, helping a local wizard, defeating the local lych, etc. are not empire straddling global conflicts, etc.

Which is not a knock on fantasy, but rather to recognize that you can scale in or out of epic and large and history shaping narratives in any genre. 

Assassin's Creed is a good example of a game that uses history, changes it enough for purposes of allowing a character to interact with it but ultimately you're not changing it.  But you get to be immersed in it and to do the sort of things that cinematically you'd want to do in those eras. 

Middle Earth Role Play is an example of something that is esentially historical... given that there's already this expansive history established in the books and yet people want to go have adventures in that setting.  They don't NEED to overturn the results of the wars or go and kill Sauron themselves, even meet any of the characters from the books, they just want that flavor.

If I were to run a, say, Renaissance Italy game it would be about intrigue and spying and political navigation all the various interests that are going on... the city states, the invasions from France and the Ottoman empire, the Italian Wars, the Borgias the de Medicis, the Church vs. heretics, etc. etc. 

You wouldn't have to put players in positions to big-time change those events any more MERP players would have to interact with the Ring. 

Consider a James Bond game. Or a Jason Bourne game.  Those are two modern cinematic genres where players get to do big things in their own realm, but none of those story lines really overturn global political realities.  The objectives and the missions are dripping with real world politics and events and the characters do big stuff for them, and epic stuff in general, but they are also nicely contained.

I think this can be done with other histories. You can go play epic fun in Rome without having to, say, rescue Julius from assassination  to change history writ large.   Ben Hur is a great story (and I recognize that it's perhaps easier to do this with writing vs. an RPG because authors can choose how their story lines weave with actual events as to not derail established history) that weaves in a character that gets to do some epic stuff interacting with everyone from Roman emperors to Jesus ... but is still contained enough to not make people ask the ""why didn't you assassinate Hitler and stop the war"" type questions you might get with alt-history. 

Thanks for the recommendation on The Regiment and Grey Ranks, I have not seen those, will gladly check them out. ",2016-11-07 03:40:44+00:00,d9p3sjr,2.0,t1_d9p1kyl,3237.0,rpg
74,"&gt; what exactly do you mean by Historical: do you mean ""historical"" historical or ""alt-history"" historical?
&gt; In the former, you're bound by events that actually happened and you'd have to work hard to design a campaign where the players have freedom of choice and can decide the outcome but the overall outcome is the historical one. For example, you are doing a scenario that takes place during WWII and your players are British Commandos sent to the Lofoten Islands in Norway to destroy the fish oil factories there (Operation Claymore). The historical outcome was a successful mission with 1 casualty. You'd have to railroad hard to prevent a failed mission.

I'd have to say alt-History because re-enactment is a different hobby. Although I do sense that there's a fear of this, I don't think it's really founded.

For example, I don't think anyone who played Assassin's Creed was too worried about the butterfly effect or assassinating some figure who was really not killed in history or anything of the sort.  Obviously video games are more railroaded than RPGs, but that's sort of what I'm getting at with a well structured campaigned. Not so much rails but something that is fleshed out enough to provide all the detail novices would need but also designed (save for the inevitable player choice that wasn't accounted for) to be able to move the characters through the world and even interact with famous people or events but not really risk a total derailment of history.

For example, how many WWII games are there where you can't just assassinate Hitler (and supposedly prevent or stop or stall the war)?  Instead they are designed where your objectives are participatory.

Frankly, you COULD make the exact same claim about any fantasy setting. Do we feel somehow more bound by what we know of real history versus fantasy settings.  Sure, we have decades or centuries of post-setting history in the real world so maybe it feels more set in stone, but that's not much of an issue with real history if you simply ALLOW your players to do profound things and roll with it. 

Inspired by, not confined by history. Our history stops the second players roll dice, then it's just prologue.

Think HBO's Rome.  That show was certainly informed by the real history but it wasn't stridently faithful.  And it was still a great show and very interesting.  It worked in two mostly anonymous plebs into all these great moments and exciting events in the lives of Caesar, Pompey, Cleopatra, Antony, etc. 

Mr. Norrell and Jonathan Strange adds a good deal of magical fantasy into history, but it's done in a limited enough way where they are participating in real events and even changing them, but they do not decouple history so much that it's not still a profoundly historical world. 

There are dozens of modern(ish) movies that would be really fun to play as an RPG that would not require much of any worry about rewriting history or in need of fantasy boosting.  Die Hard would make a great 1 on 1 campaign for a GM and player to work through. 

I think part of the issue is that people get taught history in the form of big major events and government actions and that's sort of it. But when we play modern games, how many of them are involved with major events that players would then feel unable to change?  There's no reason that you have to play a Civil War era game and re-enact battles that can't change. If being a part of the war is the interest, you could easily be a fictional special ops squad sent on various missions to collect intel, capture spies, destroy bridges or any number of other events that give players the sort of autonomy that they expect and in which failure or success has more impact on their story than needing to worry about its impact on the real history.

Obviously because DnD was the foundation.  (You might compare this to how the Japanese animation industry took decades to throw off their Disney roots before really doing work that was unique and well outside the Disney realm).

I've personally enjoyed many more games that were not fantasy, or not high fantasy that was a DnD reskin, etc.  Even some of the fantasy injection games like Castle Falkenstein have been more interesting as subtle magic than profound -- the games I played there could have easily been just Victorian, sans weirdness. 

I don't think playing 1980s Rambo types in the jungles of south america or pirates or roman gladiators or FBI agents or 40s detectives or mobsters or cowboys or any of the non-weirdness campaigns I've played were any less fun or interesting than the ubiquitous Fantasy.

I mentioned these in my first comment.  These are fantasy injected settings, where the plots are dominated by the fantasy element and often characters are extra-normal in response. 

While they can be dialed up or down, I'd note that they often, with their injection of weirdness or horror or fantasy, establish a good vs. evil paradigm that isn't as clear in historical.

The closest we really get in more faithful historical is turning the Nazis in to the ultimate evils such that there's not the same moral consequence of being a murder hobo.  Also probably why WWII is so popular in other gaming platforms. 

I do think there's an element of RPGs where players want to do violent vigilante things that they can justify without much thought, which is generally not something afforded to many people historically.

I think this got much of the attention for the concept and resolution mechanics vs. the history.  I mean there's not a lot of history, you're very rail-roaded in who you are and what you do and where you do it.

Nothing wrong with that.

It's also a bit surprising as in general, religious fundamentalism, Mormonism, and gestapo type enforcement/inquisition aren't generally things I would have guessed would have been so happily embraced by the gaming community.  Sure, there's plenty of inquisition rhetoric in stuff like Warhammer, but I think that's more tongue in cheek and flippant (at least it's fantasy fundamentalism in a fake world) than linking to real world issues.

And in general these settings set out BIG WORLDS that you can do anything (sandbox) in.

But for historical, the big world sandbox might seem daunting to a GM, because there's the chance that your players will know more than you do about that time period and there's information over-load (whereas fictional RPG realms are usually written with just playing RPGs in mind so other stuff is just left out).

More signal to noise.

But do you think that this could be overcome by releasing a more guided historical campaign... such as the PCs playing troops in Napoleon's army or something where the rich options and interest from history can be presented by being limited in focus to players and which will both expose them to historical coolness but give them the freedom to not re-enact but to forge their own stories.

I mean, the one setting that seems to be popular is WWII in RPGs and no one really seems to think that this limits players, prevents them from changing history or doing interesting things... and sure it's often in the form of Cthulhu + WWII or whatever that already explodes the history, but I do still wonder why people are more likely to write and buy thinly re-skinned historical (like 7th Sea) than actually just DO historical.

83,"Oh man, chipping off paint or lacquer from wood is addictive. I remember as a child having a table that had a thick coat of lacquer on it that had bubbled up a bit and detached from the wood. It went from clear to opaque and like any good blister I had to chip away at it.

So of course a quarter sized blister turned into me stripping off like half the table top over the course of a few months.  Sadly, like you, not all the layer came off cleanly and some would bring up splinters, pitting the surface.

""Iâve had a number of people ask about this situation, and it seems to me that the âBridgeman Art Library vs Corelâ case (50 USPQ2d 1110) is exactly on point. Itâs a Southern District of New York case from 1999. Bridgeman produced slides of public domain artworks, and sued Corel for including the photos on one of their CDROMs, claiming that they had expended a great deal of work to make their copies as accurate as possible.
In this case, plaintiff by its own admission has labored to create âslavish copiesâ of public domain works of art. While it may be assumed that this required both skill and effort, there was no spark of originality â indeed, the point of the exercise was to reproduce the underlying works with absolute fidelity. Copyright is not available in these circumstances.
That makes sense to me â otherwise, you would be essentially recreating copyright every time you fed something into a scanner and edited out the dust, or fixed the odd typo. Every copy of Huckleberry Finn would be subject to a different copyright, because somebody had to enter the text into a typesetter, proofread it, etc.""

87,"And yet in the case of publishing the material their style and method is trivial. So trivial that upholding that interpretation of copyright would make all copyright trivial.

This is not analogous to re-photographing the same landscape, it's more a question of in 500 years someone scanning in an Ansel Adams print and claiming copyright. 

The underlying work here is clearly out of copyright in pretty much all countries. So they scan it in, pop it on the web, and someone downloads it. All they need do is take a scan of the scan, a photo of the scan, etc. and it would seem to me that given there being no actual style nor method that distinguishes the modern scan from the original work (distinct from say taking a new artistic photo inside a museum that includes another piece of art... it doesn't give the photographer any copyright over the art in their photo, but their photo itself is new art).  And it's also new art that is readily distinguishable from the original.

Public domain doesn't really mean anything that I can tell if non-interpretive, non-transformative modern replication is allowed a new copyright.  Because, say, how could anyone republish anything in the public domain if the only means they would have had to see that item in the first place is another form of publication that is more modern (and thus risks an active copyright)?  

If Shakespeare is in the public domain, do I have to go personally find a printing of it that is dated?  I don't think so.  Republishing words can mean re-typing them but that doesn't create new art any more than a sterile scan or photo of old art does the same, I would _think_.

Our infrastructure is aging, but so what? There are newer shinier cities around the globe due to much more recent population explosions and development, whereas the US population boom is half a century ago, but we have a vast vast country.  Most places we get compared to for infrastructure are one or two cities that represent the vast majority of population with population densities that are astronomical.

Being in _jail_ and being in _prison_ I suspect are two very different things.  And if we're looking at documentary style commentary, this show I think brought in too much too fast too heavy to be realistic.  It was fine as drama, who wants boring reality?  The whole premise isn't realistic. 

There are ""reality"" shows now featuring people going to jail. And even with their fake premise and editing and perhaps scripting, they're still sort of lame, all things considered. 

What prison is, however, is a great metaphor or fertile ground for film makers to tell a story about being trapped and challenged and going through an ordeal.  Lots of great movies feature jail and prison as a setting.

121,"Congratulations on finally reading the original post after only 5 days, so now you should realize that your entire argument is precluded by what was posted in the OP! 

&gt; You don't get those gifts until the wedding, kid.

WRONG.  OP stated that they ALREADY HAD THE GIFTS BEFORE THE WEDDING.  Read it again.  (kid? lol, you're name calling now? how sad).

&gt; They're going to cancel the wedding tomorrow and keep all the gifts.

This right here shows that they PLANNED to cancel and keep the gifts. Why cancel at all if stuff was paid for, and more to my point, why pay for a supposedly huge wedding venue etc. and have any expectation of making it back with cups and towels?  That's just stupid and doesn't fit the scenario of two poor disabled people at all.  

But let's address your points here:
&gt;Not a single argument to be made.
&gt;He is CLEARLY referring to cancelling the wedding at the wedding. Cold feet scenario.
&gt;Your friends and family may give you a few gifts beforehand, but a 300 person guest list REQUIRES a venue and a full wedding. Fucking requires it.

Did you miss this part from the OP?:

&gt; They ended up returning most of the gifts to people
&gt; a surprising number of people let them keep the gifts

They already have the gifts.  You can't return gifts to people that you don't already have.  You can't keep gifts that you don't already have.  They HAVE the gifts at the time of the Bachelor party.  They HAVE the gifts before any ceremony and any reception.

If you have a problem with this, it's with OP. Not with me.

&gt; Or the far more likely scenario.....the whole thing is entirely made up and he got us both. 

You've been wasting 5 days essentially arguing that OP is a liar but you keep confusing ME as the person you need to be talking to.  You should be embarrassed.

My points are ALL still valid == If you're trying to scam people for stuff using a fake wedding, it makes no sense to throw a wedding, you're not going to make more value in stuff for the money you'd have to spend. 

This is totally valid, logical, and trumps anything you're blabbing about.  It totally stands that the only way to come out ahead is to get gifts, not give an event. 

And you should notice, I didn't reply to op telling him omfg your story is so amazing.  I replied to a comment saying that the people in op's story should have gone ahead with the fake wedding.  The people in op's story (true or not) should not have gone ahead with it. They had the loot. Makes no sense to lose a bunch of money throwing an event.

My post makes no affirming claim that OP's story must be true.  You seem to think it was. Whatever. But my point was never that it actually happened, only that in the scenario as presented it makes no sense to actually throw a wedding.  In the scenario, they already have the gifts.  Nothing you can say changes that. 

&gt; But at least in a real scenario, that 100% proves that you're wrong.

Not at all. In a REAL scenario it doesn't make sense to pay for a venue/reception for 300 people to get ahead in life on the towels and coffee cups they gift you. 

You keep insisting that they have to pull off this huge wedding, but that's not any way to make ""money"" (in the form of gifts) when you're two poor disabled people who can't afford towels and coffee cups yourself.  If you can't afford towels, you can't afford to put on an actual 300 person wedding.  At best, consistent with what I wrote, you would be faking it, to get gifts and NOT deliver the event.   That's the only real scenario that makes sense.

Even if you re-write the scenario to have someone else paying for the wedding, it doesn't make any sense to cancel it. If someone else is dropping all this money (and it makes more sense to bilk them out of the cash instead, but whatever), you could have the ceremony and reception and just never have a civil wedding. No reason for ""cold feet,"" no reason to cancel anything.  But that's not what the OP established. 

My whole thread is GIVEN OP'S STATEMENT.  And it's valid under that assumption.  Your comments are basically fighting with OP and have nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  Therefore you are off topic, out of line, non responsive, and doesn't at all invalidate what I've said.

OP claims that the couple already have the gifts BEFORE the Bachelor party!

OP claims that ""They're going to cancel the wedding tomorrow and keep all the gifts."" ... "" ""They ended up returning most of the gifts to people"" ... ""people let them keep the gifts""

In OP's story, the whole thing falls apart BEFORE any ceremony or reception. AND they were *planning* on canceling it and keeping the gifts. That's what it says. The plan was ALWAYS to never actually have a ceremony or reception or anything after the Bachelor party.

Soyuz = ~5500 kg payload
Space Shuttle = ~27,500 kg payload to LEO (and that's not counting its own weight which returned, reusable, at least most of the time)
Saturn V = ~118000 kg payload 

When we look at the heaviest things put in space, the Russians only attempted entering this class twice.  The US sent up dozens of huge payloads. 

Apollo 9+ put Lunar Modules into Earth Orbit, and they generally got heavier the further along in the program, the last two being the heaviest (you can argue which one given fuel and final weight and what orbit).

126,"&gt; We were arguing whether it was likely that someone had paid for the needed materials for a fake wedding: venue, flowers, etc. Should they have is irrelevant. Also whether or not they would have gone through with getting married is also irrelevant.

The OP provides YOU no evidence that any of that was paid for. In fact, you'd suspect that if it had been paid for, it would have been specifically mentioned. Like ""and they lost all this money on the caterer and venue!""

It also makes no sense that the ""groom"" would spill the beans if all of that stuff had already been paid for. Why come clean?  If it had all been paid for, and you couldn't get the money back, sure the raechan position makes sense.  BUT it makes NO sense for people who are trying to get more stuff than they started with to fund a wedding with the intent of canceling it.  Why would they pre-plan to cancel? What does canceling get them? Nothing.  

It all that other stuff was paid for they could go through the show, not be legally married which is the only important part, and never piss anyone off (at least until they decided to ""split up"" possibly years later). 

It also makes no sense that they had the money to pay for it and would still try and get some registry gifts.  Nonsense.  Even if Dad agreed to pay for stuff, it'd be 100x better to take Dad's check and NOT pay for a venue, etc.  

There's really no scenario where it would be more efficient to be a ""thief"" here and give a ton of money to the wedding industry along the way.  Your argument in no way makes this more likely. 

If op's story is a 1/10... your version which requires these people to lose a ton more money ... because reasons... is even worse.  Don't delude yourself that you made a good argument. 

Op's post kills your entire concept. The ""Groom"" and ""Bride"" _planned_ to cancel before anything big.  PLANNED IT.  So it's clear that even in OP-world they didn't buy a venue, etc.

&gt;citizenkane86 21 points 7 hours ago 
&gt;If you said ""money is no object"" the us could put a man on Mars in 10 years. I don't mean ""let's throw a lot of money at this"" I mean money is no object. China/Russia would probably be able to pull off the same thing.

Beyond $, Russia and China are well beyond 10 years behind being able to put a Man on Mars. 

&gt; Seriously? They are not doing it because its not worth the cost. 

That's SPECIFICALLY not the question being asked. Read up.

&gt; The US currently launches to the ISS via the Soyuz. 

Um yeah, so what?  The Soyuz is an old dead end tech that is irrelevant to anything Mars related.  And at this point we're just futzing around on the ISS to keep our number of astronauts with hours up. It's not really important otherwise for a Mars mission.  In fact, Russia's inability to keep up in the space race is the reason that the ISS is a dead-end for Mars.  We put it close to the Russians because they are gimped with their limited rockets and poor launch site. 

&gt; Do you seriously think that a situation like this would ever be allowed if putting people in orbit was important for national security? There is no incentive to send men into space.

Irrelevant to the question.  We're currently in a capability gap only because our next generation tech and goals are not ready and our last gen stuff wasn't worth maintaining given their obsolescence to our needs/wants. 

We COULD have kept launching any number of a dozen rocket lines and the Shuttles and blah blah blah.  I'm not unaware of this.  Nor is that responsive to the question... who could get to Mars in 10 years. 

We have a Mars program in the pipeline.  The Russians? Not a prayer. Even with the money, they're decades behind. Again, they've never seven sent a manned shuttle in to space, never landed a man on a foreign body and returned them.  That's practical engineering that they have no resume on, and the last time they even tried was so long ago, it's unlikely they even have those personnel mothballed.

You can't buy a large enough rocket off the shelf.  You can't buy the body of knowledge gained over decades that the US has and neither other country does not have.

130,"&gt; You mean like the Russian technology used by Russia to build their rocket motors, without which, the US government currently cannot even get into space? That technology?

Yes. Are you even read in to this area at all? As in do you know anything about payloads and rocket platforms?

That Russia is STILL launching antiquated rockets is not under debate. They're running 1970s tech rockets with 1970s limitations. To the ISS which is nearly useless as a way point to Mars given that it was put in a high inclination orbit so that the Russians could get there. 

Not going to work for Mars.

And the whole ""OMFG US CAN'T GET IN SPACE!"" ... by choice. We have the technology and we have multiple platforms that have launched hundreds of times each.  We've just _retired_ them.  As in, we've retired more tech than Russia's ever even accomplished. 

That's not an insignificant observation. We haven't gone back to the moon in decades. Russia never put men there at all.  We might be a bit rusty, they don't even have that body of knowledge. We do.

We had a massively successful shuttle program.  Theirs? Hah! 

We put huge payloads in to space many many times.  They made a show of it once with the unmanned (!) Buran. The other time their big rocket failed with the Polyus. 

Why are you cheering the Soyuz? That has a payload topped out at 6k kg, Apollo, etc, needed over 100k kg. And the Russians only ever once got that kind of payload in to space, it was ~30 years ago, it was a stripped down shell of what they'd actually need and the other 5 attempts were full or partial failures.  And that was during the glory days. 

The USA has a 100k+ rocket platform coming on line soon though. 

&gt;  Except by your logic, the US never landed on the moon, because they didn't have the experience!

No, you don't get to play that game. I didn't say anything of the sort.  The Soviets haven't even had a manned shuttle or moon mission. And you're arguing that they could put a man on Mars in 10 years. 

Mars is harder than the Moon and Russia failed at the manned moon missions and they failed with a shuttle. They have a LOT more ground to make up than the USA and there's no way that their current situation makes any of that amazing leap forward likely. 

&gt; Because Russia lacks anywhere to put one? A launch site is just a matter of money and time.

Actually yes.  They don't have anything remotely equatorial. 

&gt; Neither does the US!

Sure! And yet I'm not arguing that the US is going to get a Man to Mars within 10 years.  So yeah. This just helps my argument. 

&gt; money was no object, the US, Russia and China could all pull it off.

Erm. If we run with this as some infinite cheat... like money being no object, Russia could BUY an equatorial country to launch from, or some stupid thing. 

If we mean removing reasonable financial limitations, but we're keeping things like the production ability, the science know how, etc. ... different question.

Think about that for a second. That would require actually paying people to host their wedding/reception. All of that stuff requires money up front.
The whole point is to get the gifts and not have to deliver the event. I wouldn't be surprised if most weddings result in spending a lot more money on the event than the value of the gifts by a wide margin.
If they don't have enough money for some forks or a toaster, they are not going to have the thousands of dollars as down payment for a venue.

*** You've been off topic since the start!  You could argue your position brilliantly (which you haven't. Your big technique is basically an ad hominem and appealing to your own supposed expertise because you've been to a wedding, lol), and it wouldn't matter.

See, right there, the wedding WAS A SCAM.  It was planned to be a scam.  They never intended to go through with it.  That's what ""admits that she's not really his fiance, they are just roommates and have no intention of getting married...going to cancel the wedding tomorrow and keep all the gifts.""

See, that's the premise we're working with. That's the premise that raechan2012 was responding to. And I was responding to them.

I stated that if they were pulling off this scam, it makes no sense that they even could do that because the premise is that they need money and actually pulling off a venue and all that doesn't make sense that they'd get enough gifts to make it worth it.  It only makes sense getting the gifts and not delivering the event. 

You're barking about how many ways they'd get exposed.  Yeah? So what? You seem to be arguing against a statement no one has made, like ""this is a good idea"" or ""this would easily work"" or even ""Op's story is so true, I'll bet he's telling us the truth.""  The fact that op's one follow up comment basically dodges a justly skeptical question speaks volumes.  Like 'what's more likely, this happened, or people said what if we did this!'  If we're asking THAT question... I'd say it's more likely that someone said ""wouldn't it be funny/cool/awesome if we faked a marriage to keep the gifts"" than if this actually went down. For many reasons.

Still, that's NOT the question. The only question is Raechan's. And my argument for that is entirely untouched by whatever you've been ranting about.  My position is solid.  Your rants assume tons of ""facts"" not in evidence. You assume tons of things that have nothing to do with what op posted.

Ergo, you lost before you even began your furious typing because you are NON RESPONSIVE to the question. ",2016-09-25 05:18:01+00:00,d810jw6,20.0,t1_d80zd8v,2643.0,AskReddit

133,"&gt; they have quite enough technical ability and money to pull it off if there was a political will to do it.

What? Their space program is currently what, the Soyuz. That's 1970s tech. And it's falling apart. They've barely digitized that platform.

They don't have a rocket with the payload capability.  They don't have a launch site. They don't have any practical experience with a moon landing. They don't have the body of knowledge at all.

There's been very little soviet innovation at all in the last 30 years. They're basically running a space taxi service using geriatric platforms.  The US has developed and retired much more advanced platforms since. And we have extensive experience with manned flight and significant manned missions.  Russia has nothing of the sort.  They made a show of several platforms that came to nothing. No shuttle. No moon landing. Heck, the ISS had to be compromised and obsoleted because of Russian inability to get to a more USEFUL equatorial orbit.  

And none of the political or practical aspects are there either. The only thing I can think of going in Russia's favor, which is actually a signal of their decreasing capability, is an agreement which lets them launch some rockets from a more equatorial location. 

I don't think any of you have presented even a remote argument (save oooh ahhh, they were good in the 1960s!) that supports how Russia would get a man on Mars in just 10 years having never so much as put a man anywhere but the compromisingly close to them ISS.

&gt; I think you're underestimating what the Russians have done for space exploration. First satellite, first human in space, first EVA, first hard and soft moon landing amongst a host of other firsts. The USA only started pumping money into space exploration because the Russians were routinely embarrassing them with their pioneering work, and still uses Russian space infrastructure for it's programs.
Space exploration shouldn't be a nationalist dick waving contest, it's the future of our species.

I don't think you understand the difference between propaganda and capability and you're stuck thinking that State-of-the-Art 1960 is relevant to today. 

None of those firsts are relevant. They imply Soviet innovation that the USA was deficient in.  None of that is true.

Sputnik was a propaganda victory. It was scientifically unimportant. 

Right on down the line.

Plus, the undeniable fact that the Russians haven't kept up that innovation.  The USA still using their infrastructure is a downgrade.  They're using an older, less useful platform.  And our gap, is a gap of choice, not of necessity. 

The ""infrastructure"" we're still using... is basically state of the art 1975. Were you even born when the Soyuz was the hot new thing? 

The fact is, the Russians don't have a big enough rocket to boost a payload for a Mars mission. They don't have a launch site sufficient for the job.  They've never done the practical work and learned from it of sending humans to the moon surface and bringing them back. 

So when we look at the initial question of if the Russians could do it in a decade, how could you answer yes?  Do you think that Russia can fix all these deficiencies in 10 years? It's taken them decades to slightly modernize (digitize) a few stages of the Soyuz! And the workhorse generation of those are now regularly failing.

&gt; Space exploration shouldn't be a nationalist dick waving contest, it's the future of our species.

It's hilarious you think that's somehow a defense of the state of the Soviet space program or if my issues are somehow just jingoism.  The US is currently DECADES ahead of any other nation and we're not in any position to get to Mars in 10 years.  Our best rockets are in retirement (although we do have some massive prospects on the horizon) but we also don't have a usable space station (the ISS was rendered obsolete for this purpose due to Soviet inability to reach it efficiently should it be in a more equatorial orbit). 

This isn't about dick waving, it's the observable fact that the Soviet space program has long stagnated, they're still running on 70s tech. And they have no body of knowledge for all the intermediary parts that the USA does have. How are they going to make that up?",2016-09-25 04:08:54+00:00,d80ymhp,5.0,t1_d80tja6,9337.0,history

It's sort of like the US deciding to end gas engine car development but electric cars aren't really online yet so we pay Cuba for their old but still working gas cars.

We do LESS interesting and LESS difficult things because we're currently relying on much older tech to get in to space. 

Also consider just how limited the Russian space program got as it went on.  They built something that looked like our space shuttle but it never operated.  And even with their space stations, they made poor choices because they didn't have reliable tech to make better ones.

For example, the reason we can't use the Space Station as a launching pad to get to Mars is because the Soviets demanded a poor orbit path that was easier to get to from Kazakhstan.  But it's not appropriate to sling a craft to Mars (equatorial placement would be better for that). 

I wish I recalled all the details correctly, but it's something about size of payload vs. latitude launched vs. orbit location, etc. So the Soviet Baikonur Cosmodrome's high latitude required the ISS to have a high inclination.

But what you're resorting to now is just immature. You wrote page after page about how you believe the wedding was never a real thing. Why don't you go back and read your first post? Since you are turning everything into a war of literality, you specifically said in your first post that there was never a wedding to begin with. And again in your second.

if they went that far, they probably should have just gotten married and then quietly divorced. They still would live together as roommates.

with this comment:

&gt; tpk-aok 
Think about that for a second. That would require actually paying people to host their wedding/reception. All of that stuff requires money up front.
The whole point is to get the gifts and not have to deliver the event. I wouldn't be surprised if most weddings result in spending a lot more money on the event than the value of the gifts by a wide margin.
If they don't have enough money for some forks or a toaster, they are not going to have the thousands of dollars as down payment for a venue.

So, the entire thread started NOT by assuming the original comment was true, but with the hypothetical, ""IF they went that far, they should have...""

And I replied why that would not make much sense if they wanted to make a profit off of gifts.

This has NOTHING to do with agreeing that the wedding happened or not or was a real story or not or anything of the sort.  It's simply a response to IF the story happened like that, what is the logic in actually getting married and then quietly divorced. 

My argument was actually quite persuasive and raechan commented in support.  It's -itstruethough- that can't handle losing an argument on the internet. They but in and claim that their assumption MUST BE TRUE.  

I made no such claim. My post is entirely questioning the logic behind paying out for a wedding/reception if your intent is to cancel it and keep gifts from the start. 

&gt; you specifically said in your first post that there was never a wedding to begin with. And again in your second. And you intimated it throughout the rest of your week long argument. Don't lie and say you never said that and were never trying to argue that. What are you even trying to do here?

Um what? No one got married. The claim doesn't say anyone got married. It just says they tried to pull off a fake marriage and it didn't go off.  Then the comment I replied to said ""they should have just gotten married"" and I replied against that idea.

So there never WAS a wedding to begin with. There was never even a plan for anyone to get married.  There was, at best, if we believe the op, a scheme to FAKE an engagement and never go through with a wedding! 

What both of you BOTH OF YOU seem to be missing is that the original argument is this:

&gt; if they went that far, they probably should have just gotten married and then quietly divorced. They still would live together as roommates.

143,"&gt; Don't come at me with your bullshit. 

You jumped in on a dead thread.  You don't get to blame me for your poor choices and bad logic. 

&gt; Someone saying ""that had to be the case"" doesn't mean that they are saying there is no literal possible way for the other to have occurred. That's not how language works.

Words are hard for you? ""That had to be the case"" ""There is no way"" ""Never in a million years""  ... durr wait, what I meant was ""I have said over, and over, and over, and over, that not only is your theory possible, just exceptionally more unlikely to have occurred than mine"" 

Hrm, if this happened ""over and over and over"" again, show me at least 4 times where they said my comments were possible.  

Because the actual WORDS they used... NEVER.  HAD TO BE.  THERE IS NO WAY, those are not ""possible, but not likely,"" those are absolutist. 

&gt; ""Could it have happened? Sure. It's just exceptionally unlikely."" He said that more than once.

If he said it more than once, quote it! Show me how deep into the meta argument we were before this amazing 'oh yes, it's possible, it's just not very likely' appears.

You'll find that I'm actually the one who put the entire story being a complete fabrication on the table.  And I said I have no problem believing that it is POSSIBLE.  Not PROBABLE.  Not TRUE.  Merely POSSIBLE.  Words have meanings. 

&gt; None of the things you've said are necessary.

NECESSARY, not probable, not improbable, not possible, just not necessary.  What I said is true.  

&gt; None of them are guarantees.

GUARANTEES.  Not possible, not probable, not improbable, guarantee.  What I said is true.

&gt; Plus, how many other stories in this post alone have things that COULD have been exposed long before. Infidelity. Spouse is actually gay. Etc. etc. etc.
The only problem here is that YOU can't figure out how it'd be done. Not that it couldn't be done. I'll bet you think magic shows are real too.

Your very first comment is: ""That had to be the case. ... It had to have long since been paid for for this story to be true.""

Nothing about my comment DEMANDS that the original comment IS true nor that my interpretation HAS to be the only one.  It is simply discussing the logic behind faking a wedding to make money, when most weddings aren't going to be PROFITABLE! 

It's only YOUR statements that are absolutist and dismissive. 

&gt; Even with small weddings it just doesn't work like that. Everything had long since been paid for, though by someone else, probably the grandfather
EDIT: Though really, this is a much easier scam and the family would be far less financially screwed over if they were just planning a simple backyard wedding at someone's house. Hopefully that's what happened.

Here YOU are stating that you know exactly what happened, what was paid for, and likely who paid for it, and your EDIT reaffirms that YOU believe this story to be true. 

&gt; I don't agree that the family would have had to see the venue contract

Here is me, stating an opinion AGAINST an absolute.  That's not at all like your claims to certainty. Nor is it at all a claim to probability.  It simply says ""would not have had to"" ... possibility. 

&gt; It also sounds like ... If their family ...

Me, showing questioning and uncertainty.  

&gt; Also, the plan DID fall apart. If they were clever enough to pull it off and actually book the venue and the reception and the catering and the photog and the blah blah blah... it wouldn't have fallen apart (and they likely wouldn't have pulled a profit).

LOTS of IF and LIKELY type words here. Uncertainty. Questioning. 

&gt; I doubt ANY of the things you say must have happened, happened. But even if they did, it's not at all impossible to figure out how you'd scam your relatives. 

DOUBT.  Not Certainty.  I'm speaking against ""MUST"" which is ADDING complexity and uncertainty, not declaring anything as certain.  ""Not at all impossible.""  That is, again, me speaking against certainty.

You:
&gt; I can tell you haven't been to a wedding before

Here YOU go, making ABSOLUTIST CLAIMS without any proof based only on how you feel.

&gt; There is no way you can fake a wedding

You being certain something can not happen.

&gt;  It never in a million years would have gotten that far without getting caught long before the wedding weekend.


The funny thing is, I've never once said that I think this story is true and that they pulled it off or if it weren't for those darn kids they would have.  My first comment is pointing out that IF they were going to try and pull of a wedding scam, they wouldn't spend thousands on actually putting on a huge event to do so, that would defeat the purpose! 

And that logic is still sound.

Are you female? I think your view on this comes off more like someone who has some dream wedding that they've been planning since they were a kid than the typical male interest in a wedding as something you show up to.

Nope. It's merely that one as banal as this CAN get as far as it did.  Not a very high bar.  But you seem to think I'm arguing that this is such a fool proof scam that people could start a cottage industry of faking marriages for gifts!

Men with second families, one got away with it for 14 years. People who fabricated everything on their resume and got away with it for years.  Kids who flunked out of school and conned their families for 2 years, even walked in Graduation and got an empty diploma cover, later made their own diploma and had it hanging on their wall.  People who committed major thefts or misconducts at their jobs, things which innocent people wouldn't even begin to calculate how it happened or how ""the system"" let it happen and didn't catch it for so long.

None of the things you've said are necessary.  They might be common in your experience, but they are not universal.  What if this woman has no nuclear family left?  Or what if it's just an aged mother in another state?

You've listed plenty of ways they could be exposed, but none of them are guarantees.

&gt; There is no way you can fake a wedding

Nonsense. 

&gt; and not have purchased the necessary things for a wedding

People get married without dropping $50k all the time. You don't need elaborate stationary invites, table art, floral jungles, antique limos, etc.

All the things you're talking about read like one very mainstream, middle to upper middle class white wedding behavior.  Like ""fittings.""  Plenty of women get married without a bespoke or custom tailored dress.   But even in this instance, there's no reason to think a dress was needed at all.  But heck, I've seen wedding dresses at the thrift store for $8. 

&gt; It truly would take a Sherlock Holmes to pull it off

They didn't pull it off.  And there's also no reason to think that it would be impossible to bullshit away the few people who would even expect to be involved before the actual wedding. 

""How are you paying for this"" ... ""Hank got a bonus at work and he's friends with the son of the guy who owns the venue so we're getting a deal."" 

See, not hard at all. 

&gt; RSVPing would be a killer. You need to specify the venue and pick a food option

I've been to multiple weddings that did not require a food RSVP.  One was at nice restaurant where guests ordered off the menu. Another at venue that did in-house food, also not requiring a caterer to have specific meal request numbers.  Several that were buffet.  Others hosted at a family member's house with family food.  Etc. 

Also, it would not be hard at all to even send out nice stationary invites even with food replies and ... you know... throw them away when they arrive.  HAH!

I just don't think you have a devious enough mind or run across people who do.

Heck, I was at a high class wedding where random strangers crashed the wedding and got their hotel room added to the Bride's family's room block and charged hundreds of dollars of booze to the room.  It didn't even get noticed until after the honeymoon. 

Plus, how many other stories in this post alone have things that COULD have been exposed long before.  Infidelity.  Spouse is actually gay. Etc. etc. etc.

The only problem here is that YOU can't figure out how it'd be done. Not that it couldn't be done.  I'll bet you think magic shows are real too.  ",2016-09-22 00:40:37+00:00,d7wtzcn,8.0,t1_d7vzt70,38470.0,AskReddit
154,"It's not hard to guess that (1) The best man/ groomsmen would pay for the Bachelor Party, same for the Bachelorette party.   (2) Parents might pay for a rehearsal dinner, if there even was one. (3) They scammed those venues too... paid a deposit, never planned on paying the bill.

Sounds to me that they didn't actually spend any real money at all. That's the point... get the gifts and deliver nothing in return.

That's why they'd have to CANCEL the wedding instead of just NOT getting officially married (which happens at a court, not in a church) and faking the rest of the wedding.  No reason to pay for a venue, catering, photographer, etc. and dilute your take.

155,"I don't understand what you're saying.  The wedding was a SCAM.  They never intended to pull it off, they did it to get gifts.  

You don't have to book a place for a bachelor party.  And the whole thing fell apart when they finally got to the last second before having to deliver on something they'd have to have paid a lot of money for.

I don't agree that the family would have had to see the venue contract... see that's the issue, it'd be trivial to visit a venue with your family if that even had to happen.  Most guests aren't going to help you scope places out or anything of the sort.

It also sounds like these two were rather isolated as it is. If their family is not close enough to realize they aren't even dating and a real couple, you think they're going to Sherlock their fake wedding enough? 

Also, the plan DID fall apart.   If they were clever enough to pull it off and actually book the venue and the reception and the catering and the photog and the blah blah blah... it wouldn't have fallen apart (and they likely wouldn't have pulled a profit). 

I doubt ANY of the things you say must have happened, happened.  But even if they did, it's not at all impossible to figure out how you'd scam your relatives.  Call venue, ask for tour.  Take Mom/Sis on tour.  Listen to sales pitch.  Say you need some time.  Never call them back.  Tell Mom/Sis that you decided and booked it.

I've done both and SNUBA gave me all the thrills SCUBA did without $$$ up front.  I did most of the SCUBA class in my landlocked far from the ocean state (that still has a ton of SCUBA schools for some reason) and then did the final bit while on vacation. 

In hind sight, I wouldn't have been worse off spending that time and money just doing another SNUBA outing.

SCUBA is more freedom but it's also much more expensive and you have to worry more about your heavy tank and getting in and out of the boat and how much time you have.  SNUBA... all that is trivial... you don't have a tank, no worrying about time, no worrying that since your fat ass is out of shape that you're going through air 2x as fast as everyone else in your dive party and they're going to hate you when you have to turn around early (your mileage may vary).

Downside of SNUBA is that you're tethered to the boat. Meh. For your first few dives you're probably not going to go way deep or go way away from the boat anyway.    And I got to see Sharks and awesome reefs with SNUBA at Molokini, and my non-SCUBA family and friends did too.

""racism is everywhere in our courts. HBO's new crime drama, The Night Of, is tackling that bias head-on.""

Um what? The problem with this show if you want to pretend it's some deep commentary on racism, Nasir DID way more than enough to be tried and convicted of murder.  He picked up a girl fronting as a cabbie, he bought her booze, he took her drugs, he stabbed her, he screwed her, and he was in the house when she was killed, then he ran and resisted arrest and was found with a consistent murder weapon on him.  

It's not like he got picked up on the street by a cop because he was non-white and run up the flag pole over his race.

171,"As an aside, I find that the first one or two times playing a new system are poorly indicative of how that system really runs, helped only if the GM is experienced and some of the other players are as well. But there is a rather profound learning curve and getting up to speed with a new-to-everyone system isn't really practical unless you're going in for a campaign. 

I enjoy playing more than collecting books and systems. And the biggest impediment I've seen is prep time and second is recruiting players.  System hopping harms both of those efforts.

And having played a lot of SW and GURPS, yes different people bring different things to the mix. That's a strength of the system, allowing that.  Heck, I'd even say that the same GM and the same players switching systems still plays much the same.

To wit, there is narrative and mechanical fun to be had from games.  Doing something cool as a character, or having the mechanics blow up in your favor.  Looking at what people talk about or memories I have of fond experiences, most are of what we did in the game regardless of the mechanics.  But sometimes it's about how the initiative worked out just right or the damage exploded to some amazing level, things which had narrative consequence but the actual enjoyment was meta, from the effect of the crunch.

Overall, I have more fun with creative people than with some system.  Good people can make bad systems fun.  Even great systems can't save crappy players.

It's rather the difference between people who collect cars like art and those who take whatever they have out on the track and race them. If you enjoy looks and potential and value... by all means ... but if you enjoy the practical and visceral, just owning expensive cars isn't going to cut it.  The proof is in the eating.

For the second interpretation there's really no argument, what other people like or don't like is not really up for debate or change save through intensive psychological manipulation (marketing, manipulation, etc.).   The first interpretation, however implicitly demands explanation: it's not to say you're wrong (you can like what you want, not like what you want), but to describe the appeal of such a system.

Many of these are spectacular games that wouldn't justify their own system or one will never exist or just doesn't yet exist.  And yet these one-shots are all here because of a universal style system.  That's another thing.  One shots vs. campaigns.  I can justify learning some new system for a campaign that will run for months or years. Buy the books, get into the fluff.  But for a one shot?  Nah.

SW also happens to scale well over time, so it's easily a good system for a campaign as well.  I'd say the same thing about GURPS but most GURPS games I play have custom tailored characters to the scenario... it's easy to create a power level that is balanced and already capable from scratch... and the advancement mechanic is not profound.  Just more points to buy more stuff.  This is OK over a campaign, but nothing chunky like fantasy leveling up.  SW is in the middle. 

I think the concept you're getting at is less ""sameness"" because in my experience these games don't play the same at all.

Lots of universal systems make design choices that don't overly capture one style of play within the mechanics.  Like why can't a non-rogue attempt to hide? Or pick a lock? etc.

Is the ruleset THE GAME or is the ruleset a means to adjudicate a story? The more heavy handed the rules are with style the less they make sense to play out of that genre.  Try playing historical Romans with DnD.  They even put out a source book.  But it sucks.  It doesn't model it well.

185,"Hollywood going to liberal.  

Do you think the leftist dogma hurt The Night Of?  I mean, it's undeniable that the choice in subject matter feeds in to things leftists like to talk about.

And even the choice of plot details was chosen to buck stereotypes. The dark man who killed the white woman was innocent and our protagonist.  The prison kingpin was actually intellectual and noble. The other Black suspects appeared guilty but were innocent.  And the two worst actors were a manipulative white man preying on old women and a manipulative white-Jewish CPA who is a thief and a killer.

Plenty of Strong Women (TM) to go around, even though the tumblrinas are crying about Chapoor's downfall. 

But I think the show transcended any preachy cliches. Plenty of flawed characters all the way around. No horrible political jabs (like inserting some George Bush knock off that they all mock, because rawr we hate GB!).  Maybe because this show was made while a Dem is in the White House, so the criticism is more about ""the system"" than taking jabs.

I lean right-libertarian and despite all the possible leftist choices (hey, let's make some Muslims sympathetic, hey let's make a white guy the bad guy, hey let's hire a female actress who is over 40, etc.) they didn't just rest on their self congratulations.

188,"The other big shift between the two versions is the racial aspects. 

In the BBC version the victim was Black and ""Naz"" white.  In the HBO version there was a lot more depth of interest because the victimized minority story line had a living victim and more family that could be used during the show. 

The effects on the Brother and Naz's Parents were really effective storytelling. And of course watching Naz become hardened was tragic. 

Hollywood is still a bunch of privileged white folks lecturing everyone on behalf of their pet minorities (a whole lot like those Sarah McLachlan ads... if YOU care at all, you'll listen to me and give me money to save these poor animals... errr ... people!).  This can come off very preachy and tired.

189,"The BBC version really made you pay attention. They showed things without a lot of explaining.  The entire last episode is a rather huge reveal all over the place but they don't confirm with you what happened. 

For instance, is Freddy dead at the end? We know Hooch strangled him until he gave up the name. We think. And then Freddy's crew comes and kills Hooch, we think. If Freddy was dead would his crew know it was Hooch so fast?

And then with ""Naz"" ... they set him free but on what grounds? Because the new evidence or because his lawyer was incompetent, is he CLEARED or is he waiting for a retrial, etc. etc. 

The Box-Freddy relationship is very different because, of course, Freddy is not involved in the two deaths in the HBO version.  In the BBC version, he is, right? It's implied I think that the death was done by someone on his crew on the outside. 

So Freddy doesn't just peg ""Naz"" as innocent in the BBC version, he KNOWS it from the beginning. 

And Box isn't working with Freddy (as much?) in the HBO version. It's sort of implied that Freddy might have sent Box the video evidence and Box got it to Stone in the HBO version, but in the BBC version we see Box and Freddy meeting face to face.

And heck, Freddy lies right to Box's face then too. 

So both Box and Freddy were corrupted and brought down in the BBC version.  Box was discovered for being corrupt and possibly even hiding the evidence that would exonerate ""Naz"" and Freddy is killed? and was more of a manipulator before (he had his goons inject ""Naz"" with drugs against his will, for example). 

In hind-sight the plot lines that HBO added (the CPA and step-father drama) were there not as a red herring but because of a shift in who/why the murder happened in the first place.   

This also explains why there was no Hooch character.

Box-Freddy isn't nearly as strong in HBO, since the killer really had nothing to do with Freddy in this version. Not the case in the other version.

In the BBC version Box and Freddy both have their tragic falls. Freddy is choked to death (we assume, we see him being choked until he reveals the killer's name and then we don't see him again), and Box is outed as having worked with convicts too closely. 

I think Box working with Freddy is arguable in the HBO version because of how active Box is in the investigation after he furthers his hunch. He tries to derail the trial with the DA and that doesn't work, then Stone's conversation with him. I guess we could say that Freddy got the evidence sent out without Box at all.

The implications aren't really there in the HBO version.  Box isn't disgraced. He's more redemptive in the HBO version.  And Freddy isn't as manipulative in the HBO version either.

If it was choice by the HBO version to change that relationship even more radically, I wonder why they would have Stone question Box assuming it was him.",2016-08-29 18:14:16+00:00,d71i41b,4.0,t1_d71hk6x,716.0,TheNightOf

223,"Ah, I love Diplomacy. It's like Hearts where you basically HAVE to screw over your friends, but unlike Hearts there is a lot more buy in before it happens so people take it really poorly when they get stabbed. 

Only played once in person though. Used to play online at dipbounced and ended up in a few games with some of the top Diplomacy Players in the world.  My best bud from college and I ran the same account and we got good enough that they had to cheat against us (must have had access to the website back-end). That ended our run because why play if it's not fair?

We could tell they cheated because of their behavior and the sudden and improbable perfection of their counter moves. For example, we were approaching a winning stalemate and had out-maneuvered the rest of the board and done it honestly (i.e. we didn't back stab anyone, we were really honest with our planned moves, things like agreeing to bounce over territories and publishing our moves and basically saying, here's what we're doing, you can choose how to respond). 

So late game they started stalling, abusing the system by not finalizing their orders until the last minute, or repeatedly going over but the game organizer didn't punish them for it, so what could have taken a few days to finish turned in to weeks.  Technically not cheating, but obnoxious, trying to punish people who are winning.  Well, several of the on-the-way-out countries dropped out or were kicked out for not submitting any orders. All the drops were instantly filled with new players who never communicated but coordinated perfectly with the losing side. 

After all the also-rans were replaced by what acted like suicidal puppets, the stalling changed. If we put in our orders quickly, they would too, but we were never the last ones. If we waited until the deadline, they'd all go over the deadline.  So for the whole beginning of the game when we would open publish our moves, they couldn't get it together to stop us, and then after we didn't they'd guess right 100%, even when we mixed it up and did some non-standard crazy things. We brought it up with the site owner and they made the game disappear, which altered the stats for two of the top ranked players (it's otherwise impossible for your number of games played/won/lost to go down!), they deleted all our forum inquires, etc. 

Man, don't know why just mentioning Diplomacy brought all that back.  We weren't even mad, though, we just decided they played meta-Diplomacy better than we did by getting in with an admin or owner or hacking the site.

226,"The new crime scene is actually quite different from the BBC.

In the BBC version, there were TWO murders that night. The woman SAW the first one and is chased out of the area by the first killer who is trying to cover his tracks. He eventually catches up with her (off camera, of course).  But in that show, the woman is stabbed only once in the heart.

Freddy in the show is a bit different. He has his thugs inject ""Naz"" with drugs against his will to start his addiction.  It's also implied that Freddy knew about the first murder and it was maybe one of his guys on the outside.  He and Box had a too-cozy relationship where Box would share information with him and the reverse so they could both get along in their careers, one a police detective, the other a life criminal leader. 

There's also an entirely different character in the jail that cracks open the case.  He talks with Freddy and Freddy slips that he knows ""Naz"" is innocent. This character wonders how he knows this. 

Box comes to the Prison and reveals that he's in with Freddy, but Freddy does not spill the truth on Box's hunch that ""Naz"" is innocent.  Box then meets with ""Naz"" and tries to get him to confess after the fact, that it would allow him to get out earlier if he shows remorse.  ""Naz"" refuses, which makes this scene seem like a test Box is giving him.  He has no other reason now (he's been convicted) to keep proclaiming his innocence if he's guilty. 

Our extra jail character, he gets alone with Freddy and strangles him until he tells him who killed the girl.  Freddy almost dies but doesn't.  The extra jots off a letter to Kapoor with the info. Our extra is killed by Freddy's goons.  ""Naz"" is released from jail, likely because of the appeal over incompetent lawyer.

Box's boss discovers that Box knows who the real killer is.  Box admits that he tried to protect the greater good by letting the criminals police the criminals, because he had too few resources to do it the hard way.

The boss says there's one last thing Box can do, which we assume is admit that he's found new evidence. Later they show him meeting with the victim's father, who already knows about ""the other guy"" and isn't so concerned that ""Naz"" will likely win the appeal. ""Naz's"" family throws a welcome home party.  (he's named Ben in the BBC version). 

The mom admits she thought he did it but hopes they can move on.  ""Naz"" is broken up that he's had to torpedo Kapoor to get his freedom, Stone tells him that they had no idea that new evidence would turn up and that ""this"" (he's free and is going to win the appeal with the new evidence, and that Kapoor is going to get disciplined and ruin her law career) is justice, messy but justice and that they had to tank Kapoor when they did.

As a political fad, its rather clear. You have Presidential candidates pushing out documentaries on the subject.  Explosive media and publishing on the subject, etc.

240,"&gt; It was chemical-phobia leading to drastic consequences (hey CO2 is now an evil chemical! Not plant food. Water vapor too... because evil water, oh but the actually toxic greenhouse gas Ozone... need more of that).

&gt; No one has said that CO2 or H2O are evil chemical, but if you put more of those in the atmosphere, you'll get warming.


See I think you're wrong here, specifically in the political advocacy and the language used there. The language of chemical-phobia is exploited to change minds. ""Pollution.""  Well, ok, so Fresca is pollution because it's Water and CO2? Your lungs are filled with pollution? The two major components of plant food are pollution?

In the way this is sold, the water aspect is mostly ignored. In fact CO2 is reduced to ""carbon"" because that sounds like a solid, something like steel, something like coal and particulates and black.    Water vapor doesn't have a negative image. 

&gt; As for ozone, you realize that we're talking mostly about stratospheric ozone, right?

Again, I'm speaking to the advocacy and branding.  The mostly baseless hype over CFCs and Ozone that was popular was about chemical-shaming CFCs and elevating Ozone.  Ironically the claim was there being too little of a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, hah!  But Ozone's elevation meant that the language was chosen carefully. We could justly talk about it being a toxin, heck we could outright smear it as ""once liquid ozone was tried as ROCKET FUEL but it was found to be TOO UNSTABLE and highly volatile!"" Even in its gaseous form it's a POWERFUL OXIDIZER!!!   And stoke the chemical-phobia.

241,"&gt; And climate science will never be objective because it's inherently statist and political. It goes hand in hand with we must DO something radical and massive or else.
&gt; Sorry, but that's not a rational claim, that's an ideological one. You disagree with the scientific findings because they disagree with your own political position.

You assume I disagree with any findings. Not the case.  Rather I recognize the logical fallacy for what it is: one big appeal to consequences.  On both sides.

The factual heating or cooling of the earth and its causes will out eventually. But the political policy of great effect will not be decided upon facts and reality but upon perception and political maneuvering.  

Just like the DDT ban. That wasn't decided on good science. That was decided on manipulative nonsense, but it was so politically expedient to push through a ban and get a quick ""win"" for the newly minted EPA, it was rammed through and really never thought of much again save to keep pushing the nonsense.

The game is not decided upon who is better, it's decided on who scores the most points, and you can score points for more reasons than actual skill or merit.

The global warming panacea (Cap and Tax, Carbon fees, etc.) are the game being played. And THAT is the actual question which the vast majority of the public is going to be asked to decide on.  Not on the science.  Democracy doesn't mean anything to the science, people voting or deciding doesn't change reality one bit.  But Democracy and public opinion matters greatly on the political response.

It's a clear factor in climate ALARMISM (or perhaps activism) and it is a factor in the weltanschauung of many people involved.  Scientists are not impartial automatons.

245,"&gt; raw data is next to useless

Yes and no.  No because there's the simple truth that weather effects (what we're supposed to be scared of) rely on actual temperature. Not third derivatives of anomalies, etc.  We experience real temperature, not long term trends, etc.

The more I look at it, it seems a problem of trying to measure something you can't actually directly measure. From a layperson you might think ""they measure the planet, it's warming, case solved"" but when you get down to it there are so many layers. And each layer of complexity adds a degree of uncertainty.

Take satellite measuring. Ok, so we can only measure one area at a time, and we have to use multiple points to try and get a big picture. Do we ""infill"" or do we estimate differently. How do we account for time differences in data points, temperature fluctuates during the day. How do we account for weather... same place could have a marked temp swing within 5 minutes.  etc. etc. etc.

So in good faith you have to make all these models on how you want to massage your data. A mistake in even one of them would systematically corrupt any conclusion.  And despite the dubious 'small changes in carbon lead to large changes' in weather/climate, this also sets up the problem that the supposed changes that fall out of the black box are tiny compared to gross temperature and well within a range that could be easily accounted for with a single flawed assumption in any of the myriad models that manipulate the data.

The effect is not so large that the error introduced by the models can be written off.

Compare this to say, measuring the base of the Great Pyramid. Our tape measure might stretch a bit from the heat of the sun, artificially decreasing our measure. But the effect would be orders of magnitude smaller than what we're measuring.  Probably don't have to worry.

But when we're measuring fractions of degree changes over the huge range of temperature and the models we manipulate the data with changes to those numbers with a greater magnitude than the effect we're even trying to measure.

When debates get political, and climate is inherently political, much like ""gun violence"" ... we can see people using data to push their side. There are studies which come out which boast BIG things. But when you look at the raw data, those big things are more a product of math gimmicks than reality. 

There was a popular study which claimed that Miami-Dade was particularly biased in cop killings of Blacks vs. Whites. Huge multiples.  The actual data didn't show that at all.  A _model_ spat out that result and from looking at the data it appeared to be abusing infinity (dividing by zero, etc.).  

Well, if you just read the study, you'd probably think OOOH, Miami has a huge racist cop problem. And the people who have a bias in that direction spammed the hell of that study. It confirmed those biases so it must be good science.  Not flimsy science.

Ok, so this proves nothing regarding climate, other than to point out that no conspiracy was needed, just confirmation bias.

The climate stuff seems rather profoundly manipulated.  There isn't the luxury of laboratory conditions and widespread data collection.  There seem to me to be numerous proxy methods. And those all require some sort of major translation.

I respond to this, particularly the part ""he's not going to help Nas""

&gt; The state is required to share all exculpatory evidence (they can't cherry pick what they share. They find evidence that helps free Naz, it's their duty to share it).

My comment is true. 100% true. Needs no qualifications. 

I did not speak at all to HOW or WHEN or WHY the state might come in to exculpatory evidence. Which is what you seem to be off on.

You're wrong here too. Box doesn't HAVE to go back and look at any evidence in regards to the trial already underway. But that means nothing. He could review footage he's already looked at in preparation for his testimony. He can simply on a whim or his own desire look at different or new footage, and he would if the defense raises issues, and of course what I've already said, if it comes up in relation to another investigation. 

&gt; Why would Box keep digging to find evidence of an alternate killer?
Moreover, you're not even addressing my actual arguments. You're combining actions and motive on Box's part that I do not demand be linked.  He does not HAVE to keep digging TO find evidence of an alternate killer. 

All that has to happen is that he comes across evidence that is exculpatory. He doesn't have to be looking for it. Nowhere do I say that he's going to randomly take up the duty of the defense and search out other theories. 

It's just that your imagined scenario isn't the only one that has Box coming across exculpatory evidence. ",2016-08-17 20:21:48+00:00,d6lngv8,10.0,t1_d6lm134,1699.0,TheNightOf

From a film perspective, the palm makes for a better shot, I think. It's meatier, so it's easier to make it look like the knife is deep in the flesh, even though it's blunt and not cutting into the actress.

If the show runners just wanted to show the corruptive nature of being in jail, I don't think they'd need to elaborate nearly so much on a singular other inmate, they could just keep having Naz be victimized and degraded by other inmates, like the one who threw hot oil on him.

Stone is failed multiple times by all the people he goes to for treatments.  Multiple doctors. Friends and acquaintances. And based on spoilers for the next episodes, even the miraculous Chinese medicine ""cure"" is short lived. So the medical system has utterly failed Stone.

Consider how both Stone AND Naz share allergies.  Allergies are symptoms of a corrupted immune system.

There are lots of other body-systems-as-civil-systems that have failed in the show.

My above post talks about the judicial system as immune system.  Well we also have the school system failing Naz. And the job market failing his family.  Naz was basically kicked out of school because the school couldn't protect him from abuse following 9/11.  And his parents are victimized as well being marked as related to that killer.

Over-all I think it's a subtle masterpiece.  The failures are not catastrophic.  They don't kill the patient.  They just vex and corrupt and degrade.  Like the eczema.  It kills a few of Stone's dreams and a bit of his happiness (he can't wear shoes and is humiliated by the weird treatments people suggest).  Likewise, the same cops and judges and lawyers might very well put away lots of bad guys for crimes.  But they also allow innocent kids to slip through the cracks.

That's one way to weave Freddy in to the crime (death of Andrea). Another way would be if he has something to do with the death. Which would be really coincidental, and it makes me feel that the death in that case could not just be random.  Andrea would have to die because of some reason related to Freddy or someone on his crew.  It would still be good bit of forced-plot having Naz stumble in to some Freddy drama twice.  Once the night of and another time in jail.

And I'll bet that the actor's eyes were part of the casting demands. Consider how much we've talked about eyes in this thread already.

Also consider two points that were major but not touched upon yet, the ""where you are allowed to look"" in prison and in the court room.  You're supposed to look people in the eyes without looking them in the eyes in prison, so you have to make it seem like you're willing to look them in the eyes but avoid doing it to not provoke an issue.

Then they give Naz nearly the same advice (and he laughs about it) for how to look and act in court. While they didn't say this explicitly, I think this can work as ""act like prey but make it seem like you're ready to be a predator."" 

See, a true predator has no problem looking things in the eye, staring, etc. They are not worried that their looking habits will provoke harm on them.  But the prey has to act like they could be a predator, they could be willing to be violent.

It's almost a microcosm of the whole problem with the Middle East.  The West (supposedly) values Freedom, Secularism, Democracy ... so what happens when our choices are Democratically Elected Fundamentalists vs. Secular Dictators.

443,"&gt; Native American gods / Egyptian gods / Pagan gods / etc.

I'd argue that this is more a sign of the replacement of primitive ""explanatory"" religious cults that would never survive modernity anyway with modern PHILOSOPHICAL religions and eventually just modern Philosophy. 

Religions built around cultural guesses on why Thunder goes boom and why the sun traverses the sky were going to be undone by Science no matter what.

On a bigger picture, religions which then go on to ask bigger picture questions that we also ask in Philosophy, are bound to over-take and supplant those that fail to do so.

And eventually, which is what I contend we see now in the West, we do away with the need for sky-god approvals at all.  We can justify our moral laws on their own merits and not ""because sky god said so.""  In the same manner that our political structures don't require the same sort of cult control.

Religions and Governments both exist in part to control people.  And Religions and Philosophies both exist to determine morality and meaning.  Well, it was easier to control people and enforce their behaviors when the powerful called upon some special relationship with the sky-god to bolster their power.  The divine right of kings, etc.

We don't need that as much today. We are more used to having fallible people control us for brief periods and using tools like democracy to decide which direction we go in next.  We don't need god-kings and unexplainable powers.  

The cultural wars that happened to suppress people were not particularly wonderful events, but there's no real reason that we should go back to believing in those primitive religions.   Knowing that the Sun is a huge ball of gas is progress over thinking it's some divine god who hates us.  etc. 

We can make some larger view that Christianity existed in Europe and perhaps played a positive role in advancement of science and knowledge therein, and thus it was an integral part of the cultures which eventually went on to dominate Europe and the New World, etc.

We could also talk about how Christianity also subverted the old modern order, the Roman Empire and how scientific and modern thinking advanced under Islam while it was regressing in the West, etc.

444,"&gt; My point was simply, you wouldn't change the very way you believe because someone else who says he believes the same thing goes around being evil. He clearly didn't believe the same things you do, because you're not a mass murderer.

Possibly, but I think there's some truth that having violent rhetoric in your holy book is one thing, seeing it taken out against you, your loved ones, or others is a different matter.

I mean at some point Christians and Jews decided that we no longer had to sacrifice their children to God to prove their faith, or stone people for the list of offenses the OT calls for, etc.

Even minor cultural violence went out of fashion with Christianity like circumcision, before coming back in fashion with the Progressive movement in America.

It's one thing to be a devout Muslim in a more modern state where the State hangs some gays here and there. Whatever, you know that homosexual acts are still rampant in your culture and that it's really only the men who don't make a show of having a family, etc. that ever really get caught and killed .... but then your state is overthrown and a religious sect holds power and they start tossing gays off buildings. 

I think that takes some of the civility off the table.  I think that does have the power for people to question why we care so much about punishing gays in the first place.  Why are we killing gays when we can't even get food in the stores or keep our kids safe and educated, etc.

Likewise, don't you think that the Western nations, who had rightly admired Germany for her modernization and industrialization, changed their views of the extent of BIG GOVERNMENT when we found out about the concentration camps and final solution? 

I think most Muslims, like most people everywhere, are indoctrinated into their birth culture and are marinated in it a good long while before they reach the age of reason and consider larger truths than the ones they've been told.  No one would recreate Islam or Christianity or any other religion if we all suddenly forgot our past... these things exist only because people continue to tell the myths to the next generation.

Compare that to observable truths, things that are objective and can be witnessed and empirically derived.  Science for the most part.  If we all forgot our past, we would eventually rediscover scientific truths. 

The only way we'd ever re-invent Islam or Christianity is if amazingly another prophet appeared and re-told the ""good word"" according to ""god."" 

In the West we have a growing secular moral debate. People who want to define right and wrong by reason and a more rational method than revelation from Gods or prophets.

We are in the process of down playing our historical indoctrination.

Islamic nations are largely going the other way. Iran was more modern and free and secular under the Shah. And the more modern dictators who have been ousted have not, so far, been replaced by increased modernity increased secular values, etc. ",2016-07-15 21:41:02+00:00,d5durle,9.0,t1_d5dt7wd,2298.0,pics
445,"That just speaks to the impotence of trying to compare Christianity with Islam.

Westboro Baptist?  Seriously, what is the extent of the harm of WB?  They hold up stupid signs and annoy people. That's about it. In fact,I'd argue the only reason anyone knows about WB is because they make a convenient target for the left to try and slander the religious-right, even though WB is actually founded by a Democrat. Politically, the Evangelicals align with the Republicans so any trashing of church-types appeals to the left, accurate or not. 

But what of WB? Are they some powerful force? Do they have expansive membership? Are they killing anyone? Are they getting any laws passed? 

In my view, they are only significant because they are a useful idiot for the media who gives them attention, much more than they deserve given any sort of power they have.  It's basically one crazy family.  Sort of like the Duggars, notable only because they are a minor spectacle.

Heck, the ""church"" aspect of WB isn't even very compelling. They aren't part of any larger organization, they aren't affiliated with anyone but themselves. They're basically one extended family of a few dozen people who protest.

Problem with Islam is that we can point to the actual doctrine which justifies this behavior.  It's there and is used by Imams to stir up this violence.

447,"Yes, and this is precisely the reason we're flopping around looking for some sort of strategy: we are not fighting a traditional nation state that has borders and established authorities and diplomats and the ABILITY to declare war and declare peace. 

Islam lacks the hierarchy that we've come to establish in the West.  At one time we had our Catholic popes leading armies, now that is gone and likely to never return, but we do have the ability to press for clarity of Catholic doctrine and there is ultimately a singular head that can pass down in as much as possible ""one voice"" of that religion. 

And all the Christian fragments off of Catholicism, we generally have similar power structures and modern concepts of accountability.

And of course, we really have no good comparison in Christianity to what is going on now with a swath of Islamic fundamentalism. 

We don't have the Pope out there demanding that gays be killed, etc.  Even where we do have Christians behaving badly, it's what... ""we don't want to cater your wedding"" and ""we don't want you to call that marriage.""  Meh.  I think it's silly and hardly productive to modern life, but it's nothing like the sort of oppression, violent or otherwise, that we have going on in Islam. 

Recall that Charlie Hebdo was about silencing Western criticism of Islam.  We can't even speak ill of the prophet. 

Targeting is a very hard issue. So is a solution.  It's not as if we can magically manufacture a version of Islam that catches up with the trajectory other major religions have taken ... namely coming more in line with secular morality and de-emphasizing the authoritarian elements.

I'm not sure it's even possible with Islam.  It was founded as a philosophy that justified violent conquest.  Consider this... and I don't think that we can even establish that a physical Jesus existed, but we do have the myth of Christ and that's ultimately what matters as a practical matter... but Christ led no armies. He killed no men, he raped no women, he married no children, he never called for any cities to be razed or nations conquered nor people harmed.

We can not say the same for Islam and Mohammed. He was a caravan raider who became a warlord who then enshrined his military and tactical supremacy with a religious myth.  And his doctrine, the doctrine of expanse and conversion and domination will always exist within that religion.

So the task of trying to water down Islam to match what has happened with Christianity in the West is perhaps impossible.  We had reason to be hopeful, nations like Turkey were Muslim and very modern.  But even Turkey is regressing.

448,"Heh. So you're sending this comment up via smoke signals from your fox hole, then? 

There are causes worth waging war for.  Crippling German imperialism was worth fighting two World Wars over (as a majority German nation, by the way, few people realize this about the USA, they think that we are a majority English nation), and relegating fascists like Stormfront into an impotent joke, was worth waging war.

It's funny you would think that speaking against the illiberality of Islam and fascism would make one sympathetic to Stormfront? What a joke.

It is rational and moral to declare that elevating and respecting women on the same level as men is a good thing and that Islam fails to do this, thus it is against modern values.  

It is moral and rational to declare that consenting adults should be allowed to form whatever relationships they please and that the state or any religion should remain powerless to prevent that.  Islam fails this standard and thus we should reject all forms of it that demand corporal punishments and carry them out against gays, etc.

Etc. etc. etc.

And it's not that I think every Muslim is ""out to get my ass,"" it's that there is not ONE single thing in Islam that would bring about a world I would want to live in.  Not one more liberal philosophy, not one push for a freedom that I do not have now, not ONE better idea on how to treat my fellow man.

And there hasn't been a century since its inception where Islam and its comparatively regressive philosophies has retreated from attempts to expand and dominate.  Islamists are setting fires at nearly every edge of its combined territory and Islamic states that were progressing on modernization and liberalization are being overthrown by regressive, brutal, and immoral brutes.

We have made the mistake of thinking that the Internet and modern realities would change the outcome of overthrowing dictators.  When the Shah of Iran was overthrown, that country regressed into greater religious fundamentalism and the same story has repeated following the Arab Spring and deposing Saddam and Mubarak and Gaddafi, and now Assad, etc.

There is absolutely a war within Islam over its future as either modern states or as a fundamentalist religious tribe.  Tribalism is winning in the Middle East.  Modern statehood appears to be stable in the East/Asian Islamic nations.

449,"&gt; 7)finally, yes the conflict between Christianity and pretty much every other religion has lasted thousands of years but honestly there's no reason anymore that religions can't come to terms with one another and overcome the us and them problem despite having differing beliefs in spirituality

Except in the West, we have mostly folded the good aspects of Christian morality into our civil code, morals which can be arrived at with secular philosophy, and downplayed the more cultish aspects of the religion which don't serve a moral purpose so much as a tribal one.  

The West is becoming largely secular and the realm of issues we even allow religious debate on are shrinking.  And this is a good thing in my view, replacing religious cultural indoctrination with reason and laws which are more readily subject to modification and adaptation.

I.e. taking the 10 commandments and chucking out the bits that exist only to prop up the religion (you have to believe in this God, you can't say bad things about this God, you have to worship this God, etc.) and keeping the parts that are more universal and don't actually require the belief in any magic sky powers to uphold like don't steal, don't kill, etc.

In light of civil, secular, morality, Islam is horribly out-dated and antithetical to modern Western values and mores.

Two basic points: (1) We should fight ISIS and Islamofascists on the ground, kill enough of them until they are not an operational threat and destabilizing force. (2) We should fight against the regressive elements within Islam that are anathema to our Western values.

This requires both the will to kill people as the extension of politics and also to name and shame the philosophy of a religion that is not compatible with modern Western values.

451,"&gt; Which nation are we at war with now? The nation of Islam? Should we hold all Muslims responsible? Akin to the Japanese internment camps of WWII?

I answered some of this in response to the comment from YouOkChum, but I'll reiterate. 

We are not at war with a Western ideal of a nation state.  We haven't seen something like this in earnest since the Ottoman empire.  We have had conflicts on behalf of and against proper states, i.e. the Gulf War where we propped up Kuwait against Iraqi invasion.

But we are in just one stage of what has been a many thousand year long culture war of Islamic expansion.

And we are in a culture war against a religion that has largely failed to evolve to our current Western standards of culture.

The usual replies ""not all Muslims"" isn't really helpful. It's basically a language game. Meh. It's not easy to say quickly, but it's not particularly difficult to stipulate what we're really talking about.  Not ALL Muslims anything, but all the Muslims who believe in corporal punishment for homosexuality, not ALL Muslims, but all Muslims who support violence or any sort of punishment against apostates, not ALL Muslims, but all Muslims who ... etc. etc. etc.

Islam is not one thing, with one authority, with one easy to define set of traits, but it's not EVERYTHING, it's not NOTHING, it's not so nebulous and cryptic that we can't talk about it in bulk.

We can get more specific, talk about X Muslim scholar vs. Y, or Wahhabism, or what not, fine.  

But we can also talk about ALL Muslims as people who believe in fairy tales and historical indoctrination as the truth and means to govern their lives and how that practice is now profoundly at odds with Western culture all over the globe and how this is not something that we can just easily pretend is something else.

People and their indoctrinated fairy tales are not unusual, we can criticize all religions as such.  The difference, of course, is that people's fantasy lives are ok so long as they keep it to themselves, which is NOT the case here.  We can justly blast Christians when they want to prevent other people from getting married based on their fables, and yet the modern Left has no problem with this.

They do have a problem with doing the same against Islam in all of Islams many failings against liberal values. 

So we have Progressives who care more about and criticize Christians for some Pizza parlor not catering a hypothetical gay wedding but throwing gays off of buildings is ... well, let's not talk about Islam. 

Or they care more about how many inches men's knees are on the subway but really could care less to make a stink about the mass abductions of women, their religiously approved marriage and rape and divorce and trading for cycles of abuse.

452,"ISIS isn't Islam, sure, but it's not like how the Nazis weren't all Christians.

The West HAS been at war with various stripes of Islam for thousands of years. This isn't a new issue and our own general understanding of things like the Crusades are woefully inadequate.

Most people have no idea that Muslim expansion not only conquered the majority of Spain, but crossed the Alps.  Most people have no idea just how far into Europe successive waves of Islamic conquest reached, besieging Vienna multiple times. The many ongoing conquests and attempted conquests against Italy and the islands to her west.

The many century expansion into Eastern Europe.

In fact, I'd argue that Western education goes out of their way to OBFUSCATE the history of Islam vs. the West.  Consider all the coded language used to describe the Balkans. ""Ethnic Albanians"" and such.

""Chechen rebels."" etc.

Getting back to the Germans, let us not forget that WWII was in many ways a continuation of WWI, which brings in to focus that we were not simply fighting Nazis.  Both World Wars involved Germany incubating war with her closest neighbors, France in particular with whom the Germans share significant historical heritage (see Charlemagne, etc.). 

But the wars were not particularly inspired by religion. And this is a major difference and a major difference in culture which doesn't make any war against Islamofascism as simple to define as state vs. state wars.

During the WWs and before we had established, named, elected (or otherwise) leadership who represented their nations and had the authority to declare war and establish peace.  

Islam and the Arab world has never really mirrored the culture of the West to organize so neatly into nation states. In fact much of what we call those nation states are European imposed and not organically formed. 

The Ottoman empire and Persia/Iran is perhaps the closest we can identify, but many of the lines on paper that we think represents coherent states in the Middle east are just that, lines on paper.",2016-07-15 19:15:39+00:00,d5dol35,5.0,t1_d5d8ttd,21841.0,pics
453,"Sure it makes sense.  And I don't disagree. 

We might look at The Patriot Act as an example of public reactionary emotion over-ruling our long term values, failing to recognize that ""we want to empower the government to fight Islamofascist terrorists"" also means that you empower the government to spy on Grandma and you, etc.

While we might even still lack broad support against government domestic spying, mostly because I don't think most people can see when they are being spied on, versus the more apparent over-reach like TSA security which you'd be hard pressed to find any success from and broad harassment and majorly increased suffering index for travel.

I agree that our WWII military response wasn't erratic and chaotic, but it was certainly driven by anger.  If you look back at almost all calls to war in history, you very often find singular incidents or even false-flag events, that are used specifically to embolden the polis  into supporting the state into effecting war. 

Believe the theory that Pearl Harbor was ""allowed"" to happen or not, the fallout is the same, we rushed off to fight GERMANY.  

(And let's not forget that much of what we now think of the Nazis, we didn't run off to stop concentration camps and the final solution. That was not widely known during the prelude and for much of the war.)

Pearl Harbor was very much the same sort of impetus that the sinking of the Lusitania ignited for the US to enter WWI.  ",2016-07-15 18:57:21+00:00,d5dnrm2,5.0,t1_d5dabk9,18188.0,pics
454,"You seem to mistake ""logic"" for ""thinking like I do.""  They're not one in the same.

Hatred and anger make wonderful decision makers. We didn't squash German fascism with love and cultural relativism.

We didn't check Japanese aggression with microaggressions, stern glances, and The Daily Show. 

Being angry and hating is fuel to do what must be done when faced with zealots who have already gone past get along, go along, past negotiation and self sufficiency (not just the ability to take care of your self but also self satisfaction that living your own life on your terms is enough without needing to recruit others or stop others from living their lives in their matter of choosing), past peace into violence. 

The answer to ISIS is the same as it was for Germany and Japan.  To kill them until they forego their values for peace.  Their values being the desire to rule, to control, to dominate others, to convert, to homogenize. 

And it's not just Islam, although that is a major part of the cultural package. It's the religion within the cultural landscape.  It's Islam in 2015 and how it is practiced from North Africa through Eastern Europe, the Middle East and into Asia. 

It's amusing watching Progressives try and explain their way in circles.  Masculinity is toxic. But Islam is not.  Manspreading is violence, but abducting and raping young women is just their culture. Christianity is the worst thing ever, but Islam is another wounded puppy to bring into the oppression olympics tent.  Everything the Progressives supposedly believe about women, gays, and religion is totally forgotten the second Islam enters the picture.  It's deep hypocrisy.  Stand up for Western values if you can bitch about white cis man, preferably rich ones, but abandon all those values if the bad actors are horrifically and comically barbaric Muslims.   

The left loves to cry about violence that hasn't been fresh in hundreds of years, but violence that is literally happening in their faces needs to be explained away.

You think the zealots can be easily ignored?  Ignored by whom? Latte liberals in America?  Or all the people they are recruiting for terrorism and archaic fundamentalist lifestyles?  Because it's not the former that matters.

And way to make the issue so nebulous and nonsensical.  Nothing has combated Poverty, Ignorance, and Disenfranchisement better than Western Culture. And those things are not the proximate cause of these temper tantrums.  You seem to think that the wise advice to the man who comes into the ER with a shard of glass sticking out of his neck is to chew him out about his cholesterol and lack of exfoliation.  

And you're myopic if you think there's some grand peaceful history of Muslims in France.  The splashy nature of these terrorist attacks might be more recent, especially with so many in such a few months' worth of time.  But 18 years ago I recall that my AP Comparative Government Textbook had extensive material on the issue of Arab youth revolts in French ghettos being a longstanding problem.  That's the better part of a generation ago, despite the mistaken belief that Arab Islamic fundamentalist expansionism is somehow NEW and different.

You can hop back decade by decade for HUNDREDS of years and trace the Islamist expansion against Europe, waves and waves crashing against all her borders. This is not a new struggle.  You're just mistaken to think that we live in some post-modern world where nations just don't redraw their borders any more and we just don't do things like world wars and religions just don't wage wars any more and we're just better and more sophisticated than all that.

The rest of the why is simply the observation that are the heroes the heroes because we're just told they are, that the story is from their perspective, or is it because of their inherent qualities.  

As much as I love the action and world building of Star Wars, the Jedi are (as a number of others have commented, like a few Cracked articles, etc.) not nearly so wonderful as to call the good guys.  Change Jedi to Jehadi and you might get a better perspective on them.  Hokey old religions, barbaric weapons, brutal philosophies, etc.

So why not play a Jedi are the bad guys game? But but buy the Sith, you might say. Well, they are as akin to the Jedi as the Sunni are from the Shiites.  Catholic Protestant. A split from the same basic philosophy.

When you recognize that in the Star Wars universe we have two factions of the same objectionable religion and the same nuclear family in power positions screwing up just about everything else with their petty little fight...

But what if they were... what if we take the supernatural beliefs of that era and make them reality in the game setting.  Magic though would still be limited.  It could never be full blown fantasy where just anyone can run around as mage with a spell list and fling fireballs and magic missiles, etc.

In our own world, there is a dichotomy between the Judeo-Christian philosophy and the Greek philosophy. The former being about faith, the later being about knowledge.   And in our own world the steady march of Science has created wondrous powers that most of us today think of as mundane.

If we compare it to other RPGs it's sort of like a fantasy PC party having to take on some lych lords or something similar.  If this were Sci-Fi the PCs are the space crew and the Jedi are closer to the Alien xenomorph in power.... they're actually monstrous. 

In playing various forms of SW RPGs my friends have come to the conclusion that you either have to be a party of Jedi or have no Jedi because there's just no way to balance the power well.

I want to run a challenging game in the Star Wars universe, taking on the stereotypical empire troops who never seem to shoot anything is sort of blah.  My initial thought was ""Defend the Empire"" and the PCs play Imperial Storm Troopers under siege by Jedi lead rebels and/or have to infiltrate a Jedi/rebel base, etc.  Sort of answering the question ""What if the Storm Troopers weren't all horrible shots and they have to actually go head to head with some powerful ""big bads"" which would be Jedi."" 

Problem is that given the standard portrayal you may as well play Axis killing Allies.  

Other problem is that in the SW movies, the big bad guys (Sith) are all handled by the hero Jedi, usually in one on one duels... and there's just so few of the big bad guys really and they're almost all Force monsters.  It's very imbalanced... lots of literally faceless clones who pose a threat only in their numbers ... pew pew pew... and demi-god Sith who are amazingly powerful and against whom the mundanes like Solo really can't do much.

The game system I'm using (Savage Worlds) and the number of players I'll be hosting (6-8) means that I want multiple ""Bads"" to fight and that doesn't help with a squad of PC Jedi attacking Sith ... there are only 2 at any given time and the mechanics of Savage Worlds could make it a very short encounter. 

So there are simply more Jedi to be had to be fought against... so how do you make players want to kill some Jedi?  Either players play evil/empire with a straight up reading of the source OR one option is to turn it a bit on its head and make the Jedi-Sith the scary medieval religious zealots infiltrating the highest levels of both the Empire and the Republic.

It's totally conspiracy theorist and all that, but a dispassionate look at the Jedi does make them easy to recast.

And I don't think it HAS to be Luke and Leia vs. Vader.  What if the whole false flag war to begin with was a plot by the Skywalker clan to find a means to raise Vader's power versus the Emperor and depose him while raising Luke and Leia within the Rebels.  All three are actually 100% allied and Alderaan and the Death Stars and all that are false flags, conspiracies and such.... and Vader isn't even dead.  They just used the duel as a cover to get both Luke and Anakin-Vader in close proximity to the Emperor and they tag teamed him.

Which as someone else said makes this totally Game of Thrones with Vader-Tywin getting his son Jaime close to the old King, killing him, and in effect serving as the new King with his incestuous daughter and son as his right and left hands. 

Anyway, you can see this is a work in progress. Goal is to have a commando squad of PCs have to take on magical ninja baddies and have to work together and use strategy to do so, because Jedi are formidable foes.

Yes, this is pretty good.  So we take it one step further. Instead of picking one or the other fundamentalist cults, we go down a third path that says no theocratic ministers of virtue and vice playing Space Taliban.

488,"I don't think it's really that hard of a sell, if you strip away the music and the assumption of heroism and look at actual actions and philosophy, the veneer falls away.  And yeah, Paladins are horrific things if you're not of their same religion and they're butchering people for being apostate. 

The Jedi Mind Trick is particularly horrific. It's an attack on people's free will, and there's really nothing preventing it from being an excuse or tool to rape, steal, etc. and get away with it.

The Jedi also don't appear to have a consistent set of values or rules, and they are accountable to no one.  They steal vehicles, they mutilate and murder people based on no system of justice save their own authority via light saber.  

Their weapons are barbaric and they have no less-than-lethal options. They just lop off limbs left and right.

They really don't care about the Republic or Democracy.  They go into a Trade Negotiation, unelected and lacking in any diplomacy save their weapons and end up doing the usual: lopping off limbs, killing sentient droids, etc.

Mace Windu basically advocates for a military coup of the Senate. 
Obi Wan literally dis-arms PondaBaba over nothing. 

Their training is to remove emotion, including pity and remorse.

Yoda manipulates Anakin to let his mother remain a slave.

The entire abduction and brain washing of children into their cult with the younglings is pretty objectionable.

Again, if you just remove the veneer of ""THESE ARE THE HEROES OF THIS STORY"" and instead look at them as Jihadis violating individual liberties and rights all over the place like some horrific space cowboys from a new-wild-west, save the fact that they aren't filling a void in social structure, they're negating one that already exists.  In our own world, such vigilantes/gangs grow in areas where infrastructure and technology hasn't reached people and the locals have little power to combat the mafia/gangs/cults, etc.

I don't think it's really a stretch to say, ""hey guys, look at this, the leadership on both sides of this false flag induced war just happen to be the same nuclear family and we're supposed to believe that this is just a coincidence?""

Frankly, the Skywalker coup makes a pretty decent conspiracy theory. ",2015-10-06 00:25:10+00:00,cvpjkso,2.0,t1_cvpfmdi,6944.0,rpg

492,"What if we portray Leia as a mastermind instead of an innocent.  Basically Anakin tried to infiltrate the senate by merging his religious zealotry with a hereditary monarch, Amidala. And their children would be both Force-abusers with a hereditary claim to a powerful position in the Senate. 

But Amidala figured out Anakin's ploy when he couldn't keep his Force-abuse under wraps and rejected him, leading to her death.

Leia got whisked away with the 1%er life which also brought her back to diplomatic power and Luke got taken off to the terrorist training camp route, hiding in caves and being trained to be a terrorist.  They're actually reconsolidating their power with an incestuous relationship and fighting with Daddy who blew up sister's planet and so brother blew up his WMD.

Han figures out that he's just being played and he's seen enough to piece it all together.  The rebellion needs to purge the Jedi and the Empire needs to purge the Sith and the two can come back together and end the civil war.",2015-10-05 20:58:39+00:00,cvpc926,4.0,t1_cvpbi99,1094.0,StarWars

So Han, Leia, and Lando are still the good guys and they just have to purge the Jedi-Sith elements left mucking up the future of the Republic.

Or is Leia just too tainted as a princess... seriously, monarchy? ",2015-10-05 19:14:06+00:00,cvp7zcb,2.0,t1_cvocw60,70220.0,StarWars
