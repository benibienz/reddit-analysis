We had a good time with them on The Night Of board and many of us agreed to reconvene here for our new Sunday fix.

(1) I think this show is sufficiently ""literary"" to justify this sort of analysis and conversation. Many of these themes and choices are very intentional and thought out.

(2) Anachronism.  There's a wonderful duality in this world, the OLD West meets FUTURE tech.  The past recreated with the future.  And in a meta way, we have a re-boot of a property wherein our own world is so much more advanced than when it was first conceive and written.  We are watching both the past and the future, a dual anachronism. 

There are a number of anachronisms in the show. The obvious ones that are pointed out to us by the characters themselves, the quoting of Gertrude Stein by ""The Professor,"" which was previous personality for Dolores' father. 

The musical choices were wonderful and clearly meant to be both modern and historical.  Black Hole Sun and Paint It, Black appeared and they were altered.  Black Hole Sun being re-keyed to a player piano with its tinny quality and Paint It, Black getting the orchestral treatment and featured prominently during a climax of the episode. 

(3) Re-visiting the past.  Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) visits Old Bill, the second oldest host, to talk.  Doing this unannounced causes quite the stir with _ and a team of armed guards to visit the cold storage.  I suspect Ford's unannounced choices will be a driving force in the chaos and conflict that is to come on the show. His ""reveries"" update has already set the ball in motion.  Visiting Old Bill is just another example.  There will likely be many more, and The Man In Black and his ""puzzle"" are likely directly involved revealing what Ford is up to. In a way I suspect that Hopkins was cast to replicate the ethos of Hannibal Lecter: plotting, genius, sinister, charming and several steps ahead of the protagonists and the audience. There is a game being played and Ford moved first. 

The guests to the park are also revisiting the past. First time guests are visiting the simulacra of the past, but The Man In Black (who gets a parallel theme in the choice of song titles and lyrics (many featuring Black) and the Johnny ""Man in Black"" Cash song at the end credits. 

The androids themselves are looping to their pasts, with Dolores' father bringing back memories of his past lives as a Professor and a Sheriff.  This access is what Bernard believes is giving the Hosts the ability to re-write their behaviors and go off-script. 
 
(4) Livestock Management.  Judas Steer.  This will come back again, for sure, with one of the androids being chosen by the management humans as the ""Judas"" to help direct the other newly self-aware androids. The fact that the hosts are referred to as sub-human, as livestock, is a common theme in constructs-becoming-human tales.  Pygmalion, My Fair Lady, Pinocchio, I Robot, Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Metropolis, etc.  These stories all deal with man-becoming-god by making non-life come alive.  And beyond life, sentience. Self awareness. Cogito Ergo Sum. Many of these stories feature dehumanizing of the constructs.  They are given names, here ""livestock"" to reinforce the gap they have between being life-like and being life. 

(5) Layers. Sub-level 83 Cold Storage. Looks like a 1980s mall.  Previous version of the park? Call back to the 1970s movie, Westworld? 
The Updates and Reveries.  New layers on top of old layers of code. 
The re-casting. We know that characters have played different roles in the past, and that the new update allowed some of them to access those ""wiped"" memories.  Layers of identity built on old identities. 
The physical layers of building up the Hosts. They feature prominently in the lab scenes where we see the spider-like muscle fibers being added and skin layers added via dipping. 
The geographical layers... we know there's the town and the ""good"" side of the river, but more dangers lie outside of town.  This is also reflected in the virtual map of the park and the zooming in and such that happens.

(6) Wouldn't hurt a fly.  The Asimov rules for robots are in effect.  No hurting humans.  But the robots are going off script and the use of flies was a repeated and important image of that.  When the Sheriff had his melt down there was a fly on his face. In the lab, Bernard repeats: wouldn't hurt a fly. We're shown several flies crawling all over the bots and they do nothing to them.  The show opens with an extended scene of one on Dolores.  And full circle, at the end, the awakening Dolores finally swats at the fly on her neck. A big deal and important repetition. 

(7) The days cycle, ground hog style. The plots repeat. There are subtle changes, but it keeps iterating and repeating. We see the same events many times. This is also parallel to the discussion of DNA (which repeats, which is passed on with slight variation), ""mistakes"" and change.    The Man In Black is returning (for the Nth time) to this place, and he's on a mission.  He knows about the cycle and pokes fun at it (I have other plans tonight, Dolores -- after we see him slaughter her family and drag her off the ""night"" before). We know Ford repeatedly visits Old Bill.  

(8) Writers. Grammar. The show has a meta-layer of writers... sort of like the play within a play.  We know the show was written by real people. But then there's the park employees who are writers, writing plot and dialogue.  And this is on top of the code writers.  There's a healthy deal of mocking that goes on (Maybe he'll get to your speech next time), and the same cliche or trite lines that keep showing up in the character's dialogue (Trying to look chivalrous).  The meta-nature of the show comes out in lines like Dolores telling dead-Teddy, ""We've only just begun!"" Well yes, this is the first episode. Heh. 

(9) Dreams. ""Slumber"" is a code word that shuts off the bots.  When they are being worked on they think they are in a dream.  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? 

Just some of the themes that seemed to jump out from the first episode.  I hope it helps increase your enjoyment. ",westworld,"Anachronism, Sentience, Humanity, and Repitition",https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/55mp80/anachronism_sentience_humanity_and_repitition/

The defense at that trial would have a field day that the prosecution already took another suspect through a trial, that the other suspect admitted to stabbing and sleeping with the victim and was high on drugs, all of the evidence on the two of them, etc.

Nothing screams reasonable doubt like ""the same prosecution and police who want you to believe this successful CPA did it, tried to make everyone think that immigrant druggie did it first."" 

Of course, like the first trial there might be a lot of evidence that just wasn't presented.  But the case so far? Not spectacular. 

And all because, against all odds, you have a situation with random sex, violence, and drugs, and another plausible murderer that all happened that night but didn't end in murder, and an actual murderer who just happens to strike at just the perfect time.

I mean, imagine if Naz wasn't knocked out. CPA shows up to kill one woman and finds a man and her to contend with.  Either one gets away and it's trouble.  But the guy is there to take the wrap but ineffective in stopping anything. 

And strangely he commits the murder, it's horribly violent, he doesn't leave enough evidence there, an yet he leaves the scene like that? One wonders why he would not set a fire or remove the body, etc.

Of course these are not the concerns of this show. Just interesting things to ponder. ",TheNightOf,Ray the CPA would probably get off,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNightOf/comments/5085y8/ray_the_cpa_would_probably_get_off/

I actually think it fails at this, if that's the point. (And I don't think that's the point).

(1) Naz and the circumstance of that night are a poor choice to declare that the justice system gets it wrong. Even in the original where he's convicted before being exonerated. 

Why? There's a ton of evidence against him and he's not even a reliable witness to his own situation. Frankly it's preposterous and a major outlier to anything that would actually happen.

Want to make a statement about criminal justice? Pick some cases that are more representative of the routine and popular abuses instead of carefully crafted one-in-a-billion sorts of murders. Pick people who are convicted with no evidence at all. 

This story is a case of [even though he stabbed her, took drugs with her, fraudulently picked her up in the first place, had rough sex with her and was the only person we know was also there that night] ... [he's not the killer].  This isn't where our or any other justice system botches it.

(2) The elements of drama and characterization were manipulated and unrealistic compared to what happens in real jails.  Real reform can't happen if you create a monster that doesn't exist.  This isn't a problem with a drama, per se, but it is if you start claiming that it's effective political commentary.  The dark, brooding, corrupted to the core jail that they create is interesting fictional drama. And that's the point, I think.  As fiction that speaks to our fears and has elements of reality thrown in, it's interesting.

This show was compelling as a drama, not as a documentary. ",TheNightOf,Actually it didn't criticize the Justice System well,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNightOf/comments/5081pi/actually_it_didnt_criticize_the_justice_system/

CSI has ruined us (and lawyers claim real juries too) with it's hyper-reality.  Showing the bullets bounce around inside bodies and hitting us over the head with every little piece of evidence.  The semen everywhere. Perfect fingerprints everywhere. Video that is clear as day and super incriminating taken off of a reflection from some sunglasses on an ATM machine across the street.

Never this show. Consider how subtle this show has been, a true ""subtle beast."" 

For instance, in the original BBC version they make a relationship between Freddy and Box very clear. They spell it out that Box has a working relationship with Freddy in order to get information and give information to make both of their lives easier.  It's one of the few things the BBC version is more explicit about (they drop a lot of subtle shots that are not over-explained. 

In the HBO version, we get the Chandra kissing Naz video as the proof of this relationship. The prison guard who is in Freddy's pocket sees it, shows it to Freddy, gives Freddy a DVD copy, and that copy shows up outside Stone's door. 

Stone then lightly accuses Box of putting it there and Box makes the customary denials. That conversation is as much for us, the audience, as it is those two.

And that's it. The entirety of a rather complicated relationship between Box and Freddy and the Prison Guards with those two scenes. 

Subtle, but not absent. They gave us just enough without beating us over the head.

Likewise with the murder, they never pull the CSI all wrapped up you KNOW for sure because they show you.  In the real world we really don't get this. We don't get a perfect video and perfect DNA and everything in support of only one single interpretation. 

The weak testimony of the Hearse Driver and Dwayne Reed sealed the deal there. They didn't do it. Creepy. Violent. But not enough.  

They established more on the CPA. A relationship. A motive. A thief. A confrontation that night. 

Then the nonsense behavior of him driving back there, paying cash even with an EZ Pass, and the video which shows him on that block and then later apparently tossing a murder weapon down a drain it seemed. 

Box gives us some more, the CPA's semen in the room. Could be a bluff (when did they get his DNA?). 

And then they show Box following the CPA. That's it.  That's all we're going to get.  And that's all we need.

We were already given more than any jury would get. We saw ""reality"" not filtered through a witness.  But we didn't see it all, and there's no way with the mood, tone, and style of this show that they'd do the perfect eye in the sky telling of what happened.

When the immune system gets out of hand and over-reacts we get allergies (defensive attacks against things which are actually not harmful to us) and auto-immune diseases like eczema where the immune system fails to identify friend from foe.

Stone is part of the immune system, sort of like a helper T cell that runs around bottom feeding the little threats trying to justify his existence ushering them through the immune process. 

But the big picture of the show has been stated to give us a glimpse into the system and when it goes wrong and why and what that does to people. Like when the immune system screws up and hurts us more than it helps us.

Another good thread here talks about the eczema as foreshadowing, but I'm not sure this is the case. I don't think it's so on-the-nose as that.  For example, can we say that the eczema has foretold plot points?  When it gets worse does it get worse for Naz and when it gets better does it get better for Naz?

I'd prefer the interpretation that it's actually more random and unpredictable and happens despite our best intentions and all we do to try and fix it.  Sort of like the injustice in the judicial system.

Corruption and incompetence and errors happen and they always will.  Ethics are compromised because people are just plugging away at their jobs, making sacrifices because that's how they protect themselves.  Like the medical examiner and expert witnesses who basically agree with the D.A. to tell their stories in the light that is most favorable to the prosecution, not the neutral or independent objective light. 

It's interesting that the eczema attacks Stone, though, instead of a more attacking part of the judicial system (one of the cops, the DA, the judges).  While Stone is part of the system, and he's a little bit of a hack, he's also the part of the system that is trying to keep Naz alive and free him instead of consume and destroy him... which is what the eczema does.

I guess this is an example of ""no good deed goes unpunished"" or a sign that when the immune system attacks the body itself, it too is corrupted and harmed.  Like Stone is the victim of the corruption as well.  He doesn't have the eczema because he represents the corruption, he has it because he's the part of the system that is paying the price for the other over-zealous immune cell actors (the cops, the forensic experts, the DA, the judge, etc.).

Why a deer? Well like Naz it is a prey animal, it is naive, it is on the bottom of the food chain.  The mortician makes this more clear when he talks about Andrea being a predator toying with her prey.  Naz is the prey.

Consider how Naz is both the prey of Andrea and Freddy in much the same way. He doesn't know what he's doing, they make him do things for them he doesn't really want to do, he gives in to their will, they make him take drugs and change his natural personality.

It's also dead.  Like Andrea. Her dead eyes, marked by blood and its dead eyes splashed with blood have been repeated elements.  Its death is important, that's why we hang it on the wall, as a conversation piece, to talk about. Well, now Andrea's death is important and the trial is likewise going to feature lots of people talking about images of her dead.  Because her death is something that we want to mark, to measure, to remember.  Like the memento of the deer. 

Both met something higher on the food chain and were left transformed after. 

Predator-Prey. Death. Witness. Eyes. Evidence on the dead.  All themes, and the deer head is one that brings us right back to those two people, that night, in that room.

So while there's a lot of people thinking that the deer head is going to be a practical element in the story, I think it's being used as a figurative element for the audience instead.

Rolling with a previous idea about Jedi=Evil, I'm going to run a Star Wars - Game of Thrones crossover scenario.  4 hours.

The concept is to take the goody goody nature of Star Wars and taint it with the R-rating moral ambiguity of GOT.  What I'd like from you all is some ideas on goals/tasks/cross-over potentials to make a fun, not too serious, game.

Here's the blurb so far:
=====================
Star Wars: Coming, Winter Is 

A blonde knight with one hand. A princess in the highest ranks of power. Siblings. Lovers. Conspiratorial murderers who brought down the last regime to install their evil father on the throne. Lannisters? Nay, Skywalkers. 

Alderaan was a false flag event. The destruction of the Death Star was an inside job. Anakin ""Darth Vader"" Skywalker and his progeny have always known, always been in league. Their rise to the top of the Rebel Alliance and the Empire is no coincidence, it's all been a part of their plan. And now the only thing that stands in their way to complete galactic domination is YOU.

Restore the Republic, oust the tyrants!
=====================

So the PCs will be the non-Jedi heroes (and maybe villains like Boba Fett), teaming up to defeat Luke, Leia, and Vader (and perhaps the Emperor if his inclusion is necessary).

The opening scene will be Han and Chewy returning from a mission early to find Luke and Leia in Han's bed going at it, just like GOT where Bran finds the Lanninster siblings.  Luke will force push Han out the window breaking his back, and for the first part of the game Chewy will have to carry Han around like Hodor carried Bran. 

So, Luke = Jaime Lannister, Leia = Cersei, Vader = Tywin

Chewy = Hodor
Han = Bran (at least until he can get to a Bacta tank and heal that broken spine)

What I would like from you geniuses is more ideas on how to cross over characters and plot ideas on what the PCs need to accomplish to test the core question of can a group of non-Jedi PCs beat the Jedi heroes from the series.

R2D2 = Tyrion is appealing, C3PO = Littlefinger, as well. 

The cross over stuff is just leitmotif, it doesn't have to be deep. Just something to make it humorous and allow the gamers to snap out of getting butt-hurt that Luke and Leia are bad guys and need to be dealt with.  

For example, I've got a good deal of Star Wars terrain to use and Star Wars minis, but I'm going to have the Iron Throne from GOT be the Emperor's chair during the finale.  

What other ideas come to mind on how to structure this little adventure and what elements I can work in from ST and GOT to have a little non-serious but deadly fun?  Thanks in advance.

I would like to write a 4 hour scenario where the PCs play high level characters tasked with the mission to overthrow both the Jedi and the Sith who, in this interpretation, are both anti-democratic religious zealots who have infiltrated the Republic to bring about their dominance of the Galaxy. So this isn't an Empire = Good as much as a third pro-Republic path. 

Luke, Leia, and Vader are all a part of an inter-family struggle for dominance, Leia infiltrated the Senate via a false hereditary claim.  She and Luke are actually lovers trying to keep their blood lines pure.  Their separation from their father, Vader isn't about ignorance but because their mother Amidala grew wise to Anakin trying to use her royalty and him being unable to keep his Jedi fanaticism under wraps. 

The Jedi being the military muscle of the Senate is a corruption of democracy and akin to enforcers of Sharia law taking over a secular peaceful government.

The films as we have seen them have been written by the Jedi and portray them as the good guys and their sectarian rivals, the Sith, as comically bad and the Republic as too broken and in need of the unaccountable and unelected Jedi to enforce trade negotiations and trump elected officials with their barbaric weapons and evil mind control powers. 

So, going with Jedi = Bad (and there are Cracked articles, etc. which add detail to this), my question to you is:

Who can I use to give the PCs the revelation that the entire Empire mess is basically a family fight (Daddy destroyed my planet so I got my lover-brother to blow up his WMD)? 

A Han Solo who realizes that he's just being played by Leia is one candidate.  Lando is close enough to all the players to put it together.

I think the bad guys in the Scenario would be Luke then Vader and finally the Emperor.  Han and Chewy can fly the PCs in to the first location and then head off to settle the score with evil Leia.

I'm writing a tongue-in-cheek scenario for an RPG event for my friends (so I can't pick their brains) which is a twist on the SW universe, and I need SW fanatics to help fill out the details.

I'm working off the interpretation that the Jedi and Sith are simply two sects of the same archaic and barbaric religion and their internecine / family conflicts are a side show to their taking over the Republic and replacing it with a familial dynastic empire.  

All the Jedi are evil and we've just been given the history written by one of the sects painting them in as good of a light as possible.

Others have written on why the Jedi are actually evil, but I want to establish who might be the good guys and how they'd be aware of the Skywalker clan and the Emperor being a Sith.

I'd like to pepper the adventure with real-world analogies (The bombing of the Death Star was an inside job!  Have we seen Darth Vader's long form birth certificate?  He can deny he's a Sith all he wants!, etc.) but I also want to find a plausible means for the heroes to be the good guys who KNOW this information, that the Jedi-Sith complex is really barbaric and anti-republic and anti-democracy and that the Galaxy would be better off not having these religious fundamentalists fighting over who gets to reign over it.

So neither the Rebels or the Empire who are both headed by the same fundamentalists from the same family.

If we take for a given that the Jedi are jihadis and Han Solo was a drug runner and Vader and the Emperor were crypto-Sith, who can we possibly establish as defenders of the Republic who would have the means to figure out that Luke and Leia are evil along with their Father, Alderaan was a false flag, the destruction of the Death Star WMD was an inside job,  etc.

So who outside of Luke, etc. would be able to find out that Luke, Leia and Vader are all the same family and all Jedi-Sith?   I'd like to set the game when Vader still lives so that the PCs can have the opportunity to take out the Emperor, Vader, and Luke and Leia.
