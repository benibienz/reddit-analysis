109,"Robin spoke more about this in his replies:

&gt; love Bob till I die but I think writing something that could legitimately be called literature requires a sensitivity, empathy and brilliance way beyond the blunt instruments employed by most white rhyming lyricists. Dylan has some ineffable thing that ""cuts"" but he has the benefit of music and theatrical delivery. It's all pretty flat on the page. And like ""there's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique"" is no ""A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.

&gt; How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?

&gt; A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?""

and

&gt; thank you so much but... I just write to fit words into a melodic / rhythmic context most of the time... it's a puzzle to be solved and if some meaning or novel word combination leaks in then cool but I'm a musician / vocalist first and a writer dead last.

&gt; The verses are a kind of dazed appeal to those who might vote for him. I'm trying to understand why, because I think he is a monstrous sore of a liability. By the time I hit the choruses I've worked myself into a frenzy considering his candidacy. I believe it is important to have an outlet for panic and irate disbelief.

742,"he wrote quite a bit about Animal Collective's history with the NYC music scene in the article:

&gt; Noise and New York City are inextricably linked for me. Aside from the obvious connection to the city’s constant din, my move to New York in the late 1990s coincided with my discovery of noise music, a genre that highlights dissonance, ambience, and texture more than traditional musical components like melody and rhythm. I saw noise bands play at clubs like The Cooler, Knitting Factory and Tonic, and I hosted a weekly music show on college radio from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., which was one of the only possible time slots I’d be allowed to play some of the harshest noise music in the station’s collection.

&gt; In the fall of 2000, Animal Collective got its first practice space in Brooklyn and started to release records and play shows. I was attending college in Manhattan at the time, and actually most of the clubs we played were there too, but we were considered part of a new scene associated more with Brooklyn. A lot of the bands in this scene didn’t sound anything like one another, and there wasn’t really a catch-all genre we fit into, but I remember the word “noise.” We even used it ourselves for lack of a better term, and it’d be stuck in front of another, more accessible genre: “noise rock,” “noise pop,” or sometimes something more loaded, like “experimental.”

&gt; Experimental and noise music was not new in New York City at the time; it has a long history there with many subsets, icons and classic records going back decades. Admittedly a lot of it sounds the same from one era to the next, and it’s a slippery slope between inspiration and direct replication, but we felt the bands in our circle were trying to achieve something new and unique without referencing our influences too much. It was always for others to decide if we were successful, but we tried nonetheless.

&gt; The fall of 2000 was also a time when people started talking about a new retro rock and roll scene in New York. I remember playing a club called the Mercury Lounge around that time and hearing about another good band that often played there. I hadn’t heard their music yet, but their name and style suggested a kind of retro ’70s rock and roll, and I wasn’t compelled to check them out. I assumed their sound would be something too classic NYC for my taste, even though I loved and respected some of that music. I was listening to Television’s Marquee Moon on a regular basis back then, and you could trace some of Animal Collective’s ideas back to things the Velvet Underground were exploring in the ’60s. We were by no means against the history of underground rock music in New York City.

&gt; But we always thought that we should carry on the spirit of those bands more than the sound. In their own time they were new-sounding and forward thinking. To be truly influenced by them and part of their tradition, I thought, a modern band should find its own sound. Now that I’m in my mid-30s my stance on that has softened somewhat, but I was 21 then, and I thought more like a sports fan whose allegiances and behaviors had been cemented in place during grade school. I was on one team, and the nostalgic CBGB’s romantics were on another.

&gt; That was a mistake, because that other band I'd heard about at the Mercury Lounge was The Strokes. I heard their first record a short time later and loved it. I liked them even more when their second record came out. I’ve since seen them play in front of thousands of people, but skipping their early shows in New York City in 2000 is a big regret of mine from that era (along with never playing CBGB’s before it closed, ironically). And there was no good reason for it.

&gt; The New York music scene always has room for something classic and something new, and it often sounds best when they combine. Some of the most essential New York City bands are the ones who were open to combining the traditional with the innovative. In the 1970s The Ramones took the new energy of punk rock and applied it to the already classic sound of Phil Spector-produced girl group music from the previous decade. In the ’80s, two iconic New York groups—Sonic Youth in Manhattan and Public Enemy on Long Island—set themselves apart from many of their peers by using experimental guitar and turntable techniques to add dense layers of noise to their music, yet still managed to keep a foot firmly in their overarching genres of rock and hip hop, respectively.",2016-04-07 19:13:07+00:00,d1txctk,1.0,t3_4dsh99,1896.0,AnimalCollective

It was always for others to decide if we were successful, but we tried nonetheless.

&gt; The fall of 2000 was also a time when people started talking about a new retro rock and roll scene in New York. I remember playing a club called the Mercury Lounge around that time and hearing about another good band that often played there. I hadn’t heard their music yet, but their name and style suggested a kind of retro ’70s rock and roll, and I wasn’t compelled to check them out. I assumed their sound would be something too classic NYC for my taste, even though I loved and respected some of that music. I was listening to Television’s Marquee Moon on a regular basis back then, and you could trace some of Animal Collective’s ideas back to things the Velvet Underground were exploring in the ’60s. We were by no means against the history of underground rock music in New York City.

&gt; But we always thought that we should carry on the spirit of those bands more than the sound. In their own time they were new-sounding and forward thinking. To be truly influenced by them and part of their tradition, I thought, a modern band should find its own sound. Now that I’m in my mid-30s my stance on that has softened somewhat, but I was 21 then, and I thought more like a sports fan whose allegiances and behaviors had been cemented in place during grade school. I was on one team, and the nostalgic CBGB’s romantics were on another.

&gt; That was a mistake, because that other band I'd heard about at the Mercury Lounge was The Strokes. I heard their first record a short time later and loved it. I liked them even more when their second record came out. I’ve since seen them play in front of thousands of people, but skipping their early shows in New York City in 2000 is a big regret of mine from that era (along with never playing CBGB’s before it closed, ironically). And there was no good reason for it.

&gt; The New York music scene always has room for something classic and something new, and it often sounds best when they combine. Some of the most essential New York City bands are the ones who were open to combining the traditional with the innovative. In the 1970s The Ramones took the new energy of punk rock and applied it to the already classic sound of Phil Spector-produced girl group music from the previous decade. In the ’80s, two iconic New York groups—Sonic Youth in Manhattan and Public Enemy on Long Island—set themselves apart from many of their peers by using experimental guitar and turntable techniques to add dense layers of noise to their music, yet still managed to keep a foot firmly in their overarching genres of rock and hip hop, respectively.",2016-04-07 19:11:52+00:00,d1txara,1.0,t3_4dsg4r,2207.0,indieheads

Avey - John; genius songwriters and band leaders

Panda - Paul; genius melody-makers and band leaders

Deakin - George; underappreciated members and guitarists

&gt; My grandfather Louis and his parents left a small village outside of Kiev in the Ukraine and came to America in 1910. They came from a family of bakers and set up a bakery in New Jersey. My grandfather invented the bagel press, which shapes the bagel in a mechanical, practical way. But he needed what little money he could get for it and sold it for very cheap to a larger company, which then spread the bagel nationwide. He also invented a device that makes the grooves in the tops of Kaiser rolls. My dad has all the diagrams and blueprints for these devices.

881,"really interesting to see what Geo had to say about the Beach Boys comparisons and the band's love for The Beatles:

&gt; Geo: We get asked about Pet Sounds all the time. We like that record. We love the Beach Boys. So it's always been a tricky question to answer, because I don't want to put down . . .

&gt; Interviewer: I mean, yeah, who doesn’t like the Beach Boys?

&gt; Geo: I think the thing was . . . when the first Pet Sounds reference happened, it was around our fifth album, Sung Tongs, and at the time, we actually were listening to a lot of Beach Boys. We had grown up knowing Pet Sounds and the early surf stuff. But if you're a record nerd, you eventually start to discover this post-Brian-Wilson-domination era of the Beach Boys, in the early ’70s, where Carl and Dennis did a lot of songwriting, and you have records like Sunflower, 20/20, or Friends. That was actually the era of the Beach Boys that we were listening to a lot. So people would be like, ‘Pet Sounds was a huge inspiration,’ and we were like, ‘Eh, sort of, not really.’

&gt; Interviewer: At the end of the day, you guys were still able to forage your own thing out of the shadow of that Beach Boys comparison.

&gt; Geo: Yeah. No disrespect to Pet Sounds. Pet Sounds was an amazing record. But in terms of our iconic records, the ones that the band kind of holds up and puts on a pedestal and says ‘this had a huge influence on us,’ I don't think I'd put Pet Sounds as one of them, as much as we love it, or the Beach Boys. I think what's important for us is, like, The Beatles. The Beatles did a lot of harmonies, too.

&gt; Interviewer: Any specific Beatles era?

&gt; Geo: Everything. It's pretty easy to go from start to finish. My favorite is probably Revolver. Or Magical Mystery Tour.",2016-02-17 19:09:23+00:00,d03iron,1.0,t3_467ekm,36441.0,AnimalCollective

* Met Jess and Holly, the lead singers from **Lucius** at the record store I used to work at. They did an acoustic performance and then signed stuff and took pictures with fans afterwards. They were nice, it seemed like they were pretty used to doing in-store events like that.

* Also got to meet **Lily &amp; Madeleine** after their show earlier this year. They were so, so sweet and chatted with my friends and I for a while.
