last week i got to see S. Carey perform at ... of all places ... a flying fishing store in Minneapolis. it was the band's last stop on their tour and apparently they love fishing/that store, so there we were. their set was really pretty and included a lot of songs from All We Grow ... [here's a pic i took of them performing from my spot on the floor.](http://imgur.com/lwR3PnA) after their set, i got to chat with the very sweet, down-to-earth Sean (S. Carey) and the drummer Zach. i asked Zach if the band was working on any new music and he told me **they already had about 7 new songs recorded and enough material for a full album.** he said he wasn't sure how soon this music would surface though because **Sean already has a lot on his plate with Bon Iver this year.** he couldn't tell me more than that but i'm speculating that this might mean Bon Iver has plans to record this year........

... cut to a few days later ...

on Saturday, i got to see Devendra Banhart perform at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. he played a short set with his band which consisted of a few songs from Mala and a few new songs (!) which sounded seriously fantastic and had vibes similar to the ones on Mala (aka the whole set grooved hard and sounded cohesive). [here's a blurry picture of them performing.](http://imgur.com/FlQr8AS) after their set and in reverse-opener style, Rodrigo Amarante, Hecuba, Bradford Ellis and ambient legend Harold Budd performed separately. afterwards my friend and i waited around long enough at the venue's bar to meet Devendra ... not only is he one of my favorite artists but he's also one of my biggest crushes so i was blushing harder than i have in years ha. he was extremely kind and thankful towards us, and he signed and drew hands on [this program from the show.](http://imgur.com/a/7WfKP) in this program (and in the 2nd to last image in the photo album of it), it says that **Devendra is currently finishing production on his new album Ape in Pink Marble**! apparently at the previous night's show he mentioned that he had just finished this new album the week before the shows :D

in conclusion, new music from these great artists is in the works and we'll hopefully get to hear it soon! woohoo, god bless &amp; happy Friday, fam :)",indieheads,"Exciting News about Devendra Banhart, S.
