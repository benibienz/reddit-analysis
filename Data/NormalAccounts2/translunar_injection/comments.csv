&gt; Trump made gains among blacks. He made gains among Latinos. He made gains among Asians. The only major racial group where he didn’t get a gain of greater than 5% was white people.

I am looking at this:

But also this:

&gt; She's said that she didn't badger me for immediate changes to her video because she knew that the feature was taking most of our time.

Was a 'final sign off' on the edit in contemplation during this three month hiatus, based on your negotiations at the beginning, or the previous way you had worked on project 1?

Or is there something you can point to that the revision notes were the final say?

As long as there is nothing on which she would say you contracted so she had final approval on the edit, you appear to be on strong ground.

I do think you're right to give more thought to the commercial issue here than the strict legal one.

&gt; it doesn't excite me like the last video did.

&gt; I also felt like the scenes that were showcasing the buildings were moving so fast you couldn't really catch the beautiful decay and architecture.

The contract terms are still unclear to me. But I assume this was not done to a style or shot specification, but rather the stylistic choices and direction were left to you? If so, the comments she's made really don't get her anywhere. Your obligations in this case are essentially to perform taking reasonable care, ie, to not perform negligently. Stylistic decisions, if they were left to your discretion under the contract, aren't grounds for rescission if she doesn't like the decisions you made.

If you have any more details about the contract negotiations and what was written at the time, that would help clarify, but it sounds to me like there isn't much she can point to.

Final comment is, law is only one part of the equation in disputes. There's always a commercial aspect too. That aspect here is, is she going to be a feature of the ecosystem you work in going forward? Not as a client, but someone who can bad mouth you in the general circles in which you work?

36,"Oh, something I can actually be useful on! I'm a lawyer who is English law qualified. I can't give formal legal advice not knowing the specifics, but happy to give some general guidance.

It sounds to me like you very much do have a contract. As you intuit, the contract is based on what was discussed orally or in writing at the time. Those terms are very important in defining what your obligations were wrt the final product you were obligated to deliver. It's a little hard to tell from your description what the agreement on that actually was. In the absence of explicit terms, the obligations of the parties can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances, and perhaps your course of previous dealings.

The fact that she paid, after reviewing the product, is extremely persuasive of the fact that you delivered according to the agreement. Was there anything that can be inferred by way of follow-up requirements on your part? Also, is there any significance to the three month period it took her to get back to you? (Like, idk, competition specified 60 fps but you shot 24?). I hope you can see why I want to keep that line of inquiry open. But if it was just ""Hey, can you shoot something for me"", and you delivered and she'd paid, it is a good place to start from.

Has she given any reason why she thinks, 3 months after approving the edit, you're obligated to accommodate her changing her mind?

Final word of advice: Keep your cool in the emails. Keep it short and to the point and professional. Emails have a habit of springing to life in ways that you don't always predict. Don't let the emails drag on and on. State your position and bring it to a close.

81,"First, a disclaimer - I hold the distinction of being so anti-Trump, I was labelled in a thread on t_d two months back that listed a bunch of suspected CTR operatives on here, and I was named as probably being ""in on it"". (The data point was literally every submission I posted here that month was anti-Trump). You just don't get better anti-Trump endorsement than that.

I approached this article extremely indisposed to the author if the title were anything to go by. But he does make a number of really good points. In fact, I think whether you agree with his conclusion or not, there is a bunch of data in there that genuinely challenges a lot of the mainstream narrative about Trump and race.

His closing was pretty strong on the identity politics point too it has to be said.

I feel he ducked one issue on the immigration question however. On this, he compares two models for how people look at immigration. He describes the Trump model like this:

&gt; In another, immigration is a privilege which members of a community extend at their pleasure to other people whom they think would be a good fit for their community. It’s like a home: you can invite your friends to come live with you, but if someone gives you a vague bad feeling or seems like a good person who’s just incompatible with your current lifestyle, you have the right not to invite them and it would be criminal for them to barge in anyway.

The author portrays this as perfectly fine, but I'm not so sure. I think this is a very big locus of racism in most predominantly-white countries. It's hard to tease out, because people regard 'defending their culture' as non-racist, but it hides a racist assumption. What is it about American culture that is specifically white? Why would a child who grows up in America from immigrant parents, not absorb the predominant culture around them? This aspect of race seems to hide in a chasm in the discussion. White people who oppose immigration seem to think it's about preserving their culture. Is that racist, for the reasons I suggested, because it implies that the predominant culture is a function of race? Or is it legitimate? Is it legitimate to regard, say, black culture, as something having a unique identity, but not white culture? I think this is a tough question that deserves more discussion.

There are a lot of reporters whose reflexive liberalism runs so deep they are not even aware of the assumptions that condition their reporting, who really ought to read this and have a think about how they are doing their jobs.",2016-11-17 06:20:50+00:00,da3wdvo,1.0,t3_5ddzh6,5809.0,TrueReddit
82,"Why are you picking a lens with a fixed focal length as your first lens? Do you want all of your shots to be very wide angle? You are giving yourself absolutely no flexibility with this, unless you're looking to buy more lenses down the track.

The rule of thumb to cover all the bases is you ideally want a wide angle, a mid range, and a zoom. You might not need a zoom for music videos, idk what other purposes you have in mind. 

For music videos I'd be looking at something at least zoombable in the wide angle range, somewhere like 14 through 35 or 50. You might even be able to get 2 on your budget, one for 17-55, and a fixed prime lens at 12 or 14.

&gt; I hope the editors and columnists of the New York Times own up to their role in this outcome. This was a change election. The Democrats had a primary candidate who embodied that change. Anyone who observed the support Bernie Sanders attracted to his unlikely candidacy must have known something was in the air. Something of the spirit Obama had campaigned on in 2008, but had failed to deliver. 

&gt; I can recall few media outlets that inserted itself more rigorously into the primary to try and stifle Sanders' campaign than the New York Times. When Clinton and Sanders went to Super Tuesday, the Times gave only the most cursory hint on its front page that there was even a contest. It announced the day with the banner front page headline [""INSIDE CLINTON TEAM'S PLANS TO DEFEAT TRUMP""](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-general-election.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=A3B4148566460FD4C3D45A927BF0C8A9&amp;gwt=pay). On the biggest day of the primary season, the Times was telling its readers the thing was already over. The choice had already been made. 

&gt; Paul Krugman must be feeling especially satisfied. He took the mood of the people, and saw in the winds of revolutionary change a hunger for his favored nominee to deliver ""incremental change"". Anyone supporting Bernie was informed they were economically illiterate (big banks aren't so bad after all), racist and misogynist ""Bernie Bros"". Well, you wanted incremental change and you got it. You now have the chance to increment your way, in thirty years time, back to where we are today, thanks to the generation of SCOTUS nominees the Republicans will place on the Court. In 2050, maybe we can start with the progress Sanders offered. 

&gt; Congratulations.

That Super Tuesday article has to be seen to be believed. Paragraph after paragraph, they wrote about Clinton as if she were not only inevitable, but as if there wasn't even a contest for the Democratic nomination.",2016-11-12 04:57:39+00:00,d9wurxl,1.0,t3_5cioa2,4880.0,politics

We all know this same courtesy was not going to be extended by the Republicans to Hillary had Trump lost. She was going to be impeached whatever the merits, they were threatening not even to allow her to appoint to SCOTUS for as long as there was any Democratic President.

The Republicans play democracy like it's total war. Democrats have played it like its boxing under the Queensbury Rules. I must say it's time for the Republicans to get a taste of their own medicine, if only to teach them a lesson that two can play at that.

224,"And this is how it starts. My fears about Trump were most acute not around him having actual malevolent plans. It was around ""shit happens"". To be the President is to be in the middle of a continual firestorm. You are going to be tested. You are going to be challenged. You are going to be fiercely criticized. How you respond to that all comes down to experience, judgment and temperament. 

So when I heard Trump give a gracious acceptance speech, my fears weren't diminished. With the best will in the world, our safety and prosperity is going to be determined in a large part by his ability to keep his cool, and make good decisions.

And that remains my source of fear from a Trump Presidency.

232,"Oh this is great. The LA Times expressing concern about people turning to ""partisan media"" with its ""proclivity for checking facts"".

I'm just going to leave here a comment I made on the New York Times, as to its role in this election. 

&gt; I hope the editors and columnists of the New York Times own up to their role in this outcome. This was a change election. The Democrats had a primary candidate who embodied that change. Anyone who observed the support Bernie Sanders attracted to his unlikely candidacy must have known something was in the air. Something of the spirit Obama had campaigned on in 2008, but had failed to deliver. 

&gt; I can recall few media outlets that inserted itself more rigorously into the primary to try and stifle Sanders' campaign than the New York Times. When Clinton and Sanders went to Super Tuesday, the Times gave only the most cursory hint on its front page that there was even a contest. It announced the day with the banner front page headline [""INSIDE CLINTON TEAM'S PLANS TO DEFEAT TRUMP""](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-general-election.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=A3B4148566460FD4C3D45A927BF0C8A9&amp;gwt=pay). On the biggest day of the primary season, the Times was telling its readers the thing was already over. The choice had already been made. 

&gt; Paul Krugman must be feeling especially satisfied. He took the mood of the people, and saw in the winds of revolutionary change a hunger for his favored nominee to deliver ""incremental change"". Anyone supporting Bernie was informed they were economically illiterate (big banks aren't so bad after all), racist and misogynist ""Bernie Bros"". Well, you wanted incremental change and you got it. You now have the chance to increment your way, in thirty years time, back to where we are today, thanks to the generation of SCOTUS nominees the Republicans will place on the Court. In 2050, maybe we can start with the progress Sanders offered.

486,"I wish everyone could read this piece and reflect on it during a few quiet moments.

By coincidence, just a couple of hours ago I went over to my bookcase and picked up Simon Shama's book on the French Revolution, Citizens. 

This election has brought seems of anti-establishmentariansm to the surface in ways that haven't been seen in living memory. The author rightly notes some of the underlying causes, so well documented in long form studies of the electorate both here and that which voted for Brexit in the UK:

&gt; While acknowledging the strands of “greed, selfishness, racial intolerance, homophobia” in her subjects’ nature, Hochschild emphasizes their virtues, many of them shaped by biblical teachings: “their capacity for loyalty, sacrifice, and endurance.”

&gt; Of these, endurance is the defining quality, and the most tragic. Their suffering is not merely a personal or demographic crisis but a national tragedy. It threatens to capsize the entire republic. The Tea Partiers can’t be blamed for making a virtue of their anguish. Their situation, after all, is unlikely to improve anytime soon.

[""Inside the Sacrifice Zone"", NYRB](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/11/10/american-right-inside-the-sacrifice-zone/)

On Brexit:

&gt; Immigration, the issue on which Leave campaigned most effectively and most cynically, is the subject on which this bewilderment is most apparent. There are obviously strong elements of racism and xenophobia in anti-immigrant sentiment. All racists who voted, voted Leave. But there are plenty of people who aren’t so much hostile to immigrants as baffled by them. They feel left behind, abandoned, poor, ignored and struggling; so how come immigrants want to come here, and do so well when they get here? If Britain is broken, which is what many Leave voters think, why is it so attractive? How can so many people succeed where they are failing? A revealing, and sad, piece in the Economist in 2014 described Tilbury, forty minutes from London, where the white working class look on resentfully as immigrants get up early and get the train to jobs in the capital which, to them, seems impossibly distant. ‘Most residents of the town, one of England’s poorest places, are as likely to commute to the capital as fly to the moon.’

[""Brexit Blues"", LRB](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n15/john-lanchester/brexit-blues)

It's understandable that people want to turn over the furniture. People are suffering. The costs of globalization have been extremely badly distributed. For the professional and managerial classes on the coasts, globalization means paying a few hundred dollars for an enormous slab of television that can hang on a wall. Those people pay none of the costs borne by those in the interior who lose their jobs, often at an age where they have no realistic options for retraining (and would face age discrimination in many cases even if they did). [“Is everybody who is not a white-collar worker supposed to earn $12 an hour?”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/business/economy/carrier-workers-see-costs-not-benefits-of-global-trade.html)

These people do matter. This is what happens when you ignore their plight for 30 years. You drive them into the arms of extremism. The defeat that would be snared from a Clinton victory is if the ruling classes on the coasts who have now started paying these people at least some attention, wake up on November 9 and pay them no further thought. 

But none of that excuses what Trump is playing at. He is playing with powerful and dangerous forces. You see those countries, that are in the news every night, that have no idea of what effective government looks like? These places are proof that democracies with strong institutions are worth having. And they are so, so difficult to get. It took the Anglo-American strain from about 1215 to the 1700s to get there. It took the French several revolutions, getting there in the 20th Century. The Germans only got there after driving themselves and nearly all of Europe into the Abyss 60 years ago.

The people Trump has whipped up, and even Trump himself, has no idea what they are putting in jeopardy. [As Thomas Friedman recently said](https://soundcloud.com/katiecouricshow/8-thomas-l-friedman-connecting-the-dots), quoting a friend of his from Zimbabwe: ""You Americans kick this country like it's a football. It's not a football. It's a Faberge Egg. You can drop it. You can break it. So be careful"".

This country has come closer to the precipice of something unimaginably serious. I wish people realized that as attractive as ""burning it all down"" may sound, when you start destablizing government there is an unfathomable price to be paid.

507,"Well it's a tough one. It has been a policy free election. Something has been lost from the dialog because of that. Trump's policies would be *transformative* to put it benignly. Depending on who you listen to, they would even be disastrous.

While Vox is right on this point, I think they missed a beat when they went on to blame the attention Clinton's email server had received. First of all, it was a legitimate concern. But this misses the bigger point. People slam the media for giving rise to Donald Trump and not doing enough to ""stop"" him, which I take as shorthand for educating people on the dangers his Presidency would present.

But the media has done its job on that bit extraordinarily well. Two weeks ago I tapped out the following comment on my feelings about Trump:

&gt; Attacking federal judges - check

&gt; Attacking journalists - check

&gt; Threatening to imprison political opponents - check

&gt; Threatening to imprison attorneys acting for political opponents - check

&gt; Denouncing elections as rigged - check

&gt; Fomenting violence at election stations - check

&gt; Fomenting violence at political rallies - check

&gt; Fomenting violence against political opponents - check

&gt; All of this before he has even gained access to the levers of executive power.

&gt; This guy is a serious threat to the Republic. How much more evidence do you want?

[Link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/59qrcr/trump_we_should_just_cancel_the_election_and_just/d9av8xg/)

Agree or disagree with all or any of that as you want; but the point is, all of these judgments were formed on the basis of the media's coverage of Trump. And all of this rather blows out of the water any issues about tax rates and the economic implications of a trade war (serious though those are).

If you view Trump in the way I think many people - and almost the entirety of the media - see him, there's a much bigger risk to peoples' lives in a Trump Presidency than questions of policy. Risks like, would there even be an election in 2020, after he's arrested all his opponents?

I think the media has done better than they're given credit for.

No way could he just sit on this. The issue, I think, is simply that he's gone off half-cocked.

614,"Oh gimmie a break.

First - a disclosure, I am absolute in my preference for Hillary over Trump as President. It's not even up for discussion.

But these speeches are hardly reassuring to anyone wanting a tougher line on Wall Street. Closing the carried interest loophole is great and all, but that isn't what caused 2008. And opposing the Bear Sterns bail out as the author claims actually would have exacerbated / accelerated the catastrophe that came with the collapse of Lehman. The crisis was already baked-in. There's no point trying to be tough on the banks when the banks are - quite literally - too big (interconnected) to fail and teetering on collapse. The time was, ironically, in the 90s and 2000s when successive administrations failed to regulate the banks' risk-taking.

And here's where anyone with a seasoned eye can see she's promising to beat them with a feather duster:

&gt; And Clinton did say nice things. She said, “I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown and a lot of respect for the work you do.”

These are words intended to reassure her audience that's she's their friend. Everything she says that follows is to be viewed through that prism.

&gt; Then came the pivot: “But I do … think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in ’08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.”

Mandatory motherhood statement. One for the record. Yep, it was bad. No one in the room could deny it. So what you going to do about it? 

&gt; She did suggest **that people in the industry could help improve the regulatory system.** Even that could be defended on the grounds that only insiders understood the exotic financial instruments that almost brought the house down. (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had said he couldn’t make heads or tails of them.)

THAT""S A BINGO! Hand over regulation to the regulated. If you want a concise sentence of what lies at the root of so much that is completely fucked in America, that's as good as sentence as you'll find. Every 2, 5, n days here, when there's a story on the top of /r/all about cable companies and drug companies, and infrastructure spending, and health care, in most of those cases the root cause of that situation is regulatory failure due to corporate lobbying.

It should go without saying that Hillary's get-out for turning over regulating to the regulated, ""that only the bankers understand this stuff"", is a smokescreen designed to cover that horseshit with a veneer of plausibility.

Bankers wrote the regulations in the 90s and 2000s and/or lobbied for the absence of regulations - chiefly, in the field of derivatives, which remains a kind of financial nuclear bomb because it is many times the size of the real economy. This speech from Clinton is her saying, yep things need to be done, and we're going to toughen up a few areas that are not going to fundamentally shake up the way you make money. And we might have to single out some baddies for a perp walk every now and then if they're misselling mortgages to single mothers. But you guys at the top are fine, there's not going to be a shake up.

There are many, many things that I like about Hillary's platform. It absolutely benefited from the support Bernie got and the platform changes he extracted in his concession negotiations. And there are too many reasons to prefer her as a candidate to Trump. But let's not indulge fantasy and forget that she's been close to the corporates all her political life, and there is not a scintilla of evidence in these speeches that that's about to change, at least not to the degree the country ultimately needs.",2016-10-25 16:09:35+00:00,d97697r,1.0,t3_59bkeq,3191.0,politics

629,"I think you have left out - understandably, because it's not the most famous bit - the most *important* bit Kennedy's speech has looking back from the perspective of post-Reagan America:

&gt; During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City.

&gt; **To be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money. This year¹s space budget is three times what it was in January 1961, and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined. That budget now stands at $5,400 million a year--a staggering sum**, though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year. **Space expenditures will soon rise some more, from 40 cents per person per week to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman and child in the United States**, for we have given this program a high national priority--even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us. 

This is a description of a government that *worked*. It was a belief that paying taxes to the government *helped achieved good things*. 

Politicians don't talk like this anymore. Half of them are subscribed to a vision that wants to 'drown the government in the bathtub'. They are literally opposed to things like raising taxes to pursue important national priorities.

It is staggering to look at Kennedy's words today, seeing how he could talk about raising government expenditures, representing an increase ""for every man, woman and child"", not only without embarrassment, but with enormous pride.

It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

How fitting that the site at which Lincoln warned that the American experiment in self-government would have to be defended vigilantly, now plays host to a fascist who has declared the he ""alone"" can solve America's problems, who has threatened not to recognize the results of a democratic election, has threatened to jail his political opponents, has called for their assassination, has promised to restrict the freedom of the press, and has disparaged the independence of federal judges.

Sorry, this is sophomoric nonsense.

Your first two points are right, but the conclusions you draw from them are illogical.

Evaluation doesn't work as follows

* 5 Clinton bad things === 5 Trump bad things

The Trump bad things are off the charts. The most concerning are his lack of experience, his lack of knowledge, his lack of interest in acquiring knowledge, his lack of any competence or interest in the skills of diplomacy, his thin skin and vindictive instincts against people who criticize him.

This isn't someone who should be commanding the military. This isn't someone who should be representing the interests of the United States in negotiations on security and on trade with foreign partners and adversaries. This isn't someone who should be able to give the direction for the development of domestic policy.

You can say ""But Hillary's server"" and ""Libya"" all you like. All that proves to me is she is capable of fuck ups of the same type and order of just about every other administration in modern politics. (Much much less fuck ups than the Bush administration - hello, Iraq and global financial crisis). 

The downside case with Trump is simply of an unprecedented magnitude.

Trump's life has come to resemble an Arthur Miller play. The man who just couldn't get through life without the adulation of others. A man who, despite being wholly unqualified, ran for the Presidency because he was stung by the humiliation of an actual President at the White House Correspondents' Dinner in 2011 - mockery that he worked to bring upon himself. A man who is so shallow in his thinking, that he believed winning the Presidency would be [the answer to all his critics, the ultimate proof of his superiority over - well, everyone.](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-aide-critics-will-bow-down-president-trump/amp) A man who in his late 60s, couldn't even recognize not only that ""when you get to the top, there's nothing there"", but that there is not a person in the world under more sustained and vociferous criticism than the President. That the very thing he aspired to could never satiate the urges and desires that made him want to attain it.

On November 9 he will be branded a loser on the biggest stage on earth. He will be a national pariah, and a punchline in the bien elevée company whose acceptance he has always sought but never attained. He is a fool, who has confirmed his foolishness to anyone who was uncertain.

For the folly of his candidacy and the foolishness of his insatiable craving for approval, his exit from national political candidacy should be accompanied by an endless loop of the audience at the White House Correspondents' dinner [laughing in his face, as he sits there, humiliated, burning from the inside out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzJhvC-8E&amp;t=9m38s)",2016-10-11 12:10:23+00:00,d8n7coy,1.0,t3_56xhbw,3519.0,politics

870,"The number of separate comment threads complaining about supposed CTR shills is ridiculous.

Trump supporters for some reason don't seem to understand how strongly sentiment is running against their candidate. Sure, while the polls are somewhat even-*ish*, your candidate is someone who has vritually 100% of the mainstream media gunning against him, and that's for a reason. He has ZERO major newspaper endorsements, a historic record. He has an unprecedented number of former Congressmen of his own party campaigning against him. He has an unprecedented number of former Presidents of his own party voting for the other candidate.

Whether you like it or not, whether you agree with it, or whether you think Hillary has flaws that make Trump (for all his) a better choice, you can't escape the piling up of sentiment against this guy. Part of that sentiment includes a strong feeling among many in the media, and in the public, that he is a direct threat to American democracy, maybe even the Republic, and is *absolutely* a non-zero threat to the existence of civilzation itself.

Again, I am not litigating those points here. I know what points you have in response, I've read them. My point is, there are many people who think this election has stakes that are higher than any election there has been, maybe since 1864, possibly ever.

What do you think is going to happen when a good portion of this sub's readership feels that way? You're going to see the patterns of submissions, voting, and commenting that you do. 

The idea that people are only doing this because there's an army of Chinese out there getting paid $0.03 an hour isn't just offensive, it is totally divorced from the reality of how the election is being covered and how a lot of people are feeling about it.",2016-10-07 16:29:01+00:00,d8i1ps0,1.0,t3_56bfu0,9546.0,politics

It is not a journalist's job to try and control the narrative. If the facts tarnish someone, then it is incumbent on that person to get out and explain to the public why they do not deserve that stain, or to remind the public that there are other competing priorities they also need to think about.

1045,"&gt; What may be most significant about Clinton’s total, however, is not the $62 million she raised for her own campaign but the $81 million she took in for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. That portion dwarfs what Obama and Mitt Romney raised for their parties during this period four years ago. And it signals an aggressive effort by Clinton to extend her coattails far down the ballot as Democrats try to take back control of Congress, governorships, and state legislative chambers that they lost during the Obama era.

This is flat out wrong. There was an NPR or Politico podcast a few weeks back that dissected this in depth. The ""joint fundraising agreement"" between HRC and the DNC is simply a sham to circumvent donor limits. The agreement allows people to donate up to ~ $445,000 to the joint fundraising, on the basis that it is money being donated to local committees. In truth, Hillary's own filings have shown that they retain 10% or less of these funds. They simply plough it into H4A or Super PACS campaigning for her.

Numbers are approximate but the punchline is it is a total sham.

&gt; Her campaign said more than 2.7 million people have now contributed to her bid, but the focus on big-money donors has raised the average contribution to $50—**nearly twice the $27 average that Bernie Sanders famously boasted about during his primary run.**

First that's not going to happen. But I'm much more optimistic that that's not required. What kills Trumps movement is electoral non-viability. It is, in some ways, not a bad thing that these things are coming out. Because you have the chance to repudiate them at the polls. And then the Republican leadership will stop flirting with racism as it does not hold the path to electoral success. 

If enough people come out on November 8 and hand Trump the landslide defeat that I expect will happen, it will be a great day for the country. Someone will have offered Americans a platform of nativism and bigotry, and the electorate slams the door in his face. 

Of course there's going to be malcontents left behind, but they're out there anyway. The country as a whole will have given a clear message about the country it wants to be.

1053,"&gt; As discussed ad nausem in the multiple epipen threads, this is NOT free market, as lobbyists have influenced the government to make restrictions preventing competition.

Step back and it's not even a free market from the very first step: a patent. The patent is a creation of the state. It is the *very definition* of government intervention.

Let me be clear: medical companies are getting rich not because of the ""free market""; they are getting rich abusing a concession granted to them by the public, in the form of a patent which is a legal creation of the government.

So don't be fooled when Republicans say it's the free market. It's a government privilege - a patent - that medical companies are relying on. But of course, you won't hear Republicans speak out against that, because it's what their corporate donors rely upon.

The simple way to cut through this argument is to realize that the patent is a concession given by the public. Same deal as copyright. If companies want to enjoy these privileges given to them, they need to observe some fair play, which the government is absolutely free and justified to stipulate as conditions to those privileges. Starting with the imposition of constraints against price gouging.

No no no. Go back to to MJ in early June, they were launching some of the most viscious attacks on him of anyone in the media. They excoriated him over Judge Curiel, and over Orlando, and pretty much most things since.

What they said last winter idk but they were calling out his bs waaay before the Conventions.

These numbers only make sense if you've subscribed to a certain lifestyle. If you want to own a nice apartment and spend the rest of your time travelling the world or playing in a band an annual income of $50,000-$100,000k is more than sufficient. 

Of course to yield even $50,000 a year is going to require a $1-2MM endowment (depending whether you want it to depreciate or not) so still unattainable for most living on $140k in a big city with no inherited assets, unless you swing for the fences.

That isn't near the whole truth of what Trump said. That quote came from a victory speech after the Nevada caucus. He trotted off a long line of ""I love the ...

1161,"&gt; Trump's about to start sounding more like Breitbart. More vindictive, aggressive, and conspiracy-laden. 

Disagree. And I was totally with this theory until 24 hours ago. Then I saw an interview Mark Halperin did with a guy on WADR who was very up the curve on Bannon. What this guy said was really interesting. He gave Bannon a lot of credit for being very laser focused, referring to the work he did to put together the Clinton Cash doco. And his focus is going to be on Clinton. [Here's the clip, starts at 25.45 ish](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/videos/2016-08-17/full-show-with-all-due-respect-08-17-16)

Already the signs are showing that. The 'pivot' by Trump under the influence of his other appointee and now constant travelling companion is consistent with this. Bring Trump into the middle road, make the focus relentless on Clinton.

I'm not saying that in the end, Trump isn't going to be a vehicle for Breitbartian ideology. But I do believe both of his new advisors are smart people, and the initial indicators suggest they are going to gun for Clinton and that means keeping Trump on a very tight leash.

I think the election campaign just got tighter. I still think Clinton will win, and I think she will win comfortably. But right now my attitude is a kind of mind set that was once applied in describing the Italian national soccer team: the glass isn't just half full, it's full of poison.

They have a battle ahead but they aren't going anywhere, and the most important thing is that these people all found each other, thanks to Bernie's movement.

* Has encouraged violence against people exercising their Constitutional rights to protest

* Has incited the possibility of using violence against Supreme Court Judges and future Presidents

* Has insinuated that the current sitting President conspired with ISIS to perpetrate terrorist atrocities in the United States, including in Orlando

* Is laying the foundation for violent upheaval by insinuating that any electoral process that does not crown him the winner is illegitimate

* Is laying the foundation for violence and intimidation at polling booths in the election on November 8, by forming his own band of ""election observers"", otherwise known as vigilantes

This is man who is an actual threat to the Republic. And he is still supported by the Republican leadership to hold the office of President.

The approach was distilled when Leave’s Michael Gove, an Oxford-educated newspaper columnist turned government minister, declared, “the people of this country have had enough of experts.” Indeed, “expert” became a dirty word, its currency more soiled the more experts warned of the instability and mayhem that Brexit would bring.

1310,"&gt; “By any objective analysis, this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of American presidential politics,” Rather wrote. “This is no longer about policy, civility, decency or even temperament. This is a direct threat of violence against a political rival.”

This is right. The biggest problem I have with this incident like all those others is what it portends for a Trump Presidency. Based on what we've seen it is entirely justified to expect that Trump would:

* ban journalists who are critical of him from White House press credentials
* dismiss members of cabinet and members of federal agencies who don't act according to how he felt on a given day the Constitution entitled him to
* encourage violence against peaceful demonstrations by groups opposed to his policies. 
* publicly threaten and ostracize members of the judiciary, especially those reviewing his executive decisions
* continue to inflame the potential for political assassinations of those who were getting in his way (including those upholding Constitutional constraints on his authority)
* inflame foreign sentiment and potentially provoke belligerent actions and terrorism by supporting violence to be used against them / in regions of the world where even the threat of that kind of action would be destabilizing

This is all justified on the evidence we've seen. Trump is not one for de-escalating. He seeks, rather than avoids, escalation. He has a propensity to appeal for violence when things don't go his way. He does not respect hallowed Constitutional conventions such as respecting the independence of the judiciary. He has no discipline or self control in moderating his language, or accepting differences of opinion, or indeed in accepting the Constitutional rights of others to criticize him.

I don't think people understand fully how grave this moment is. Democratic representative government such as the US has known it for 200 years is *unimaginably hard* to attain, and incredibly easy to lose. Trump is a threat to all this. There's not a modicum of doubt. But if you sit back and wait till January 2017 to wait for proof, it'll be too late. There is literally a three month window to lawfully stop this guy, and yet it still feels like many in the country are like the proverbial frog sitting in a pot on the stove.

Here's a long-ish comment I won't cut and paste here that I wrote on the weekend essentially agreeing with you that the system is broken, and these people really do need listening to:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/4wehux/the_original_underclass_poor_white_americans/d66olkp

Where I objected to your thread was the suggestion that certain things don't matter because a cohort of the electorate have simply given up. Things do matter. It does matter when 50 national security advisors come out and say that Trump would be the most reckless President in American history. It does matter that Trump is completely unfit to be President, much less Commander in Chief. It does matter that he's inflaming bigotry to win his following.

You can't have any truck with that. It has to be denounced firmly. The people supporting him need to be told this, and not indulged in the sentiments he's exploiting.

But these people do have genuine grievance to which I am wholly sympathetic. The global economy has totally left them behind. They have been thrown on the scrapheap by the policy decisions that supported globalization, which was the right policy for the economy and society as a whole, but whose costs were borne in a totally asymmetrical way.

I do agree this should be a wake up call for the elites in that respect. From the left, Bernie Sanders' movement is the most promising at effecting a very necessary transformation. That movement is definitely not going anywhere. To an outsider it might appear that he didn't accomplish much, but that movement begat many, many leaders and put them all in touch with each other, and forged a commitment to progressivism that will make itself felt for many more years. 

It's possible to listen to Trump's electorate and approach their genuine grievances in a compassionate way. One must do that without indulging the bigotry and the anti-intellectualism that they are turning to. It flirts with a grave danger that I don't think many people - including many of the people on here, who are better educated than most - quite yet appreciate.",2016-08-09 14:59:46+00:00,d6afmcs,6.0,t1_d6adn2i,2812.0,politics

This is not news. Yes, everyone gets this. Everyone. Gets. This.

But the support Trump needs to attract to get across the line includes people who do not have this frame of mind. People for whom policy matters, issues matter, and fitness to hold the office matters.

If there is one thing the polling of the last week confirms is that this cohort was indeed a very large part of Trump's polling numbers. The more they are exposed to Trump's recklessness and contempt for the process, his disorganization, and the warnings of serious people that this guy is a huge problem for the country, the further out of reach the election gets for him.

The second thing you are missing is that there is a second group of people in play. That's the people who lean Democrat and have to be persuaded to go out and vote in November. That includes many Berniecrats, like me, who were on the fence about Trump until shit got real.

Imagine the values anyone coming up through K-12 has today. Gay marriage is just not even an issue in their minds, it's like ""duh"".

I think Paul Ryan's wing is the only way the Republicans survive the next decade as a viable party. They have got to come to the center on social policy, just as the Democratic party (in fact, the global left wing parties) had to come to the center on economics in the 80s and 90s.

But there doesn't seem to be terribly much left in the current GOP once you take away the social conservatism. They need to come up with a new platform around economic differences, and that's going to be hard because the Dems are already about as business-friendly as you can get, short of repealing all regulations and allowing a pre-30s business free for all.

1384,"&gt; Democrats want to help poor people and create jobs and social programs.

First, let me get this out of the way: I supported Bernie, and after a (very) brief flirtation back in the spring with Trump's anti-establishmentarianism I have turned away from him in revulsion and will fully support Clinton.

Here's the thing. The working class have *had* Democratic governments before. 8 years of Clinton, 8 years of Obama. Pointing out that programs x, y, and z benefited the middle and working classes simply is not an answer to what these people have been through. The decimation of meaningful work outside of the middle class. The decimation of their towns and communities. The feeling that they were left behind while the beneficiaries of globilzation got extremely rich.

The benefits of the technological explosion and globalization have been poorly distributed. That happened on the watch of 16 years of Democractic administrations as much as on Republican ones. There is no solace for these people in whether the Democrats were marginally better or worse.

Trump is the only person even pretending to listen to these people. It doesn't matter whether he screws them over in the end or not. No one else is even bothering to represent their interests.

The biggest risk of nuclear war by far is the defensive stress you are under if you are getting reports that a foe has launched a strike. You have basically in the region of TWO MINUTES to verify that that threat is real - ie, it's not a bunch of aluminium strips in the air setting of radar, or a flock of birds, or whatever - and launch the retaliatory strike. Because if you don't do it in 2 minutes, their missiles hit and wipe out the country. But of course, if you launch retaliation and the report was a false positive, you're going to get a retaliation defensive launch from the other side.

Seriously one of the scariest articles I've ever read. My takeaways were:

I've noticed one thing in common to all of those. The media plays a crucial role in forcing the issue. First there's a long campaign of whispers, and dissent, but eventually it gathers momentum. In the end, it reaches a point where the prospect of a leadership spill is the only story the media covers, it reaches such a frenzy. The entire business of government stops, the entire national dialogue admits of no other discussion but the impending overthrow of the Prime Minister.

The comparison to what I've seen in the media covering these things many times is incredibly similar in what I see happening now in the American press. Ever since last Friday, the media is in a place where there is simply no other discussion than Trump's manifest unsuitability to be President.

And let me be clear: Trump did this to himself. It is not a media conspiracy. But the media is now at a point where the question is so large, and looms over so much, that it simply cannot be put back in the box. They will only move on once this issue is resolved, and it will only be resolved by Trump's withdrawal from the race.

**Edit** In response to comments that the GOP cannot under its rules actually spill his nomination: what I've said in a few other comments is it may well be enough to force him out that they simply withdraw the entire GOPs campaign machinery from him - no money, no ground operations, and no endorsements. Whether he can be cajoled / threatened / humiliated to see the writing is on the wall and step down without it coming to that, who knows, but there are ways of effectively ending his campaign, if only by turning it into a zombie candidacy.

1484,"Here's the theory they ran on Morning Joe this morning.

Sources 'very close' to Trump say he doesn't want to *lose*, but he doesn't want to win either, because that would mean he would have to govern. He doesn't want to spend his life doing that. Consistent with that is all of his campaign chaos, the serial political malpractice that is occurring. He's not invested in the ground game to win, he keeps going off on his rants that he's been advised constantly by people close to him are hurting. He knows he has a choice between acting like himself, and acting in the way he needs to in order to win. He's not really trying to win, he's trying to be national cult figure, Donald Trump. He's made his choice.

So the best result for him is to lose by a close margin (maybe not even that close) and for the rest of his life, claim the election was stolen from him. With ~40% of the country with him - even with less - he can go and launch Trump TV, and make hundreds of millions a year. (He could even get Russian money to set it up). 

Either way, Trump isn't going anywhere after this election. He's not going back to running a real estate business. He's going to stay in this spotlight and continue to agitate the nation and the government and the Republican Party from tv land with the enormous base of followers he's won.

1. Following Twiiter in real time looking forward to the Obama speech around 10.30, and seeing it reported that Air Force One has just made wheels up in Washington at 9.20pm. Just a reminder at what a mind blowing entourage you have as the President - flying to Philadelphia in a 747 to deliver a speech, and get home in time for a late supper.

2. Obama's speech saying nobody has been more qualified to be President, ""not me, not Bill - nobody"" -- and watching Bill leap out of his seat to lead the standing ovation.

This was a special moment remembering the incredible speech that Bill had given for Obama in 2008. Obama had just beaten his wife in an acrimonious primary, which Bill himself got into the mudslinging on. But when he had to sell Obama to the nation at that convention, on Bill's record as the economic manager in chief, he just knocked it out of the park. That speech did so much to establish Obama's credibility with the nation at that moment. It was great seeing the favor repaid in real time, eight years later, with Obama's amazing speech for Bill's wife.

1611,"&gt; I understand what negligence is

Your previous post was quite clear that you didn't.

&gt; I think it's pretty hard to argue that people in general take specific precautions against unintentionally leaving their child in the car.

You are conflating the state of mind (unintentionally) with the outcome (leaving the child in the car). Your analysis is faulty.

&gt; if it was standard for people to have some type of carseat/device with an alert system installed that prevents you from forgetting your kid in the car, and you didn't install this device, then that would be negligent, because a reasonable person would take that precaution. But right now, reasonable people are not taking precautions like that. 

Once again you show confusion on the basic issues. Negligence is the failure to take reasonable care; it is not limited to a failure simply to ""engage alert systems"". 

Anyway, I have laid out the correct legal reasoning and the conclusions that apply in this case. ",2016-07-24 17:13:07+00:00,d5owf5b,10.0,t1_d5ow13c,647.0,news

1614,"You are clearly not a lawyer and your analysis of negligence is faulty. Negligence is the failure to observe the standard a reasonable person would observe to prevent the occurrence of foreseeable risks of harm. The applicable foresight here is that if you leave a child in a hot car, they are likely to die. What you are totally omitting is the standard of care in taking precautions against that risk. We expect, and the law of negligence / criminal negligence requires, people to take reasonable care. Moreover, the standard of care to be expected rises the likelier it is that a risk will occur, and the more serious a risk it is.

Most people will take care not to leave their children in a car. Moreover, we are right to expect a high degree of care to be taken, because as a society we want people to act with a high degree of care when looking after children. Especially when there is a risk of death. The policy of the law here should encourage people to exercise a very high degree of care when it comes to the welfare of children, and the application of the principles of negligence / criminal negligence will reflect that.

It is clear to me that there is a very strong case that this does meet the standard of gross negligence, whether the person simply forgot or not.",2016-07-24 12:17:40+00:00,d5ons3g,8.0,t1_d5odhzt,31167.0,news

I would caution strongly against the advice you've been given by another poster to *start by learning music theory*. There will come a time where that will be relevant. That time, in my judgment, is not now. Your focus now should be on creating enjoyable experiences at the piano, and that means playing.

Learning to read music is going to be essential. It is not difficult. Literally, take some time to memorise what the notes on the staves mean. I mean sit down at a desk with some paper and drill yourself, what's this note, what's that note. If you can memorize the players on a football team, you can do it. It can get complex later on, but you'll grow with your playing skills to get better and better at it. For the type of pieces you'll be playing now, it'll be fairly simple notation.

I can't recommend a particular course or curriculum to follow. There must be a music board in America that does formal music education and exams, like one enrolls school children in? These course would have very good simple exercises and pieces of music to bring you up to speed. I would recommend that path - it might sound a little dry, but it's very good preparation and gives you a solid grounding. If you can afford to see a teacher once a week, do so, there's nothing like it. Otherwise, YouTube and the internet will be able to help.

1683,"**DANGER DANGER DANGER**

Ok, I can speak somewhat meaningfully to this. I was a big law firm corporate lawyer for many years. I did not specialize in tax, but tax was present in most of the deals I did. From that experience, I acquired some basic understanding of how tax law works, and especially what the rationale and policy approach is, that makes it work in some ways a lay person may find surprising. I also had my personal tax affairs subject to residency ""structuring"" after I left the law to travel for a few years.

Here's my warning. 

With no disrespect to the OP, this advice is full of traps. It provides you with enough knowledge to be dangerous, and completely fuck yourself up. I will give a couple of examples below, but the **TLDR** is:

* If you're a national of X (be that USA or another country), you'll obviously need a strong familiarity with the tax treatment of X when you move overseas. That's generally doable, and is not going to be the bit you screw up.

* It is the tax treatment in the ROTW where you are at risk, especially from a false sense of security from things like ""It takes 6 months to be resident"" rule

* Offshore companies are another area where you are going to step on a landmine, probably without even knowing you're standing on it.

* The punchline is - for your ROTW taxes - you have a choice: (i) either just totally wing it and hope you'll be able to fly under the radar, and be prepared to have serious problems if it catches up with you, or (ii) invest serious time WAY beyond the kind of guidance offered here, to investigate the tax issues of any country you're spending meaningful time in, and be totally across the residence requirements as they relate to both you and any companies you own.

Without saying this is comprehensive, here are at least two areas where you can screw this up:

**Residence**

The 6 month rule is extremely vulnerable. Many countries do not look at time spent alone. Countries such as the UK test things by the quality of your connections there. The biggest lookout that has been totally missed here is whether you maintain (own, lease, rent) a residence in that country. If that's the case, you may well be caught even spending less than 6 month intervals in the country. A trip overseas is not going to do anything to change that, short of completely severing your ties, including leases, and not even having storage kept in that country.

So here - if you think you can wing it by following some hard and fast 6 month rule, accept that you are winging it and it's very likely you'll come unstuck. Otherwise, just be aware that there is a whole lot of country specific rules you are going to have to properly structure all of your arrangements.

**Offshore companies**

This is the biggest area of misconception I see on this board and in other places discussing these issues.

Having a company in a tax haven such as BVI, Cayman, Bermuda, HK, hell even Delaware, *does not insulate that company from being taxed in the country in which you are currently resident*. 

The issue here is where is the company ""effectively managed"". If you are running a company which essentially has a business which you yourself run, the tax authorities *in the country in which you are living* are very likely to say that that company is effectively managed in that country, and is therefore liable to local company taxes. Whatever your arrangements are in BVI, HK or wherever are irrelevant. If the effective control of the company is being exercised in the local jurisdiction, you are likely to have to pay local taxes - not on just the drawings you make (ie, personal income), but on the company's corporate income itself.

This is why local tradesmen for instance don't bother running their businesses through BVI companies - it's pointless, the local authorities will treat the company as being domiciled or tax resident locally for their tax purposes.

As I say, it is very easy to have a read of something like this and not realize how many ways there are to come unstuck in the local jurisdiction. Especially with offshore companies, which I see time and again people think ""BVI = No worries"". ",2016-07-18 04:48:01+00:00,d5ggpfc,1.0,t3_4tck9u,13492.0,digitalnomad

It is of far greater significance that they show what a deeply flawed candidate Clinton is, that an opponent who has been described as the coming of the Apocalypse is even within 20 points, much less tied or ahead.

I continue to believe that demographics mean Clinton will march into the White House. I also believe that these polling indications of her immense unpopularity with the electorate do not bode well for her Presidency if it comes. The Republicans spent 8 years at war with her husband and her last time. They will resume that war to a much more forgiving / willing public backdrop this time. Plus, we know Clinton's propensity for shortcuts and self-dealing is going to give them no shortage of ammunition.

I wouldn't be surprised if Clinton fails to finish her first term. I would be surprised if she did.

The DNC ought to be ashamed and embarrassed at not running a competitive field of candidates for the public to choose from, instead insisting on a coronation of this deeply flawed candidate.

He was saying that up to California, and that was the only way he could justify even staying in the race, because he was not going to catch up in super delegates. 

But he lost California and there was nothing at Convention to fight for. He had no moral case to argue that he had the momentum behind him. And it was only with that kind of momentum could he even make the argument for the super delegates to flip - a huge argument even if he had.

He had a strategy to stay in the race and keep fighting. The numbers to support him in that strategy however didn't break his way.

Going to Convention with the numbers he now has would be a pointless exercise, and exercise in humiliation and one branding him a wrecker, and forfeiting any right to have a say in the direction of anything in the party.

Ahh.

Look, it's not like designing a rocket to go to the moon. Democracy would be a terrible vehicle to make those types of decisions.
But who else can decide what are the best policy settings for a country other than its inhabitants?
Where is it legislated that a country must have x% economic growth, at certain costs and tradeoffs? Why is it x%? Why not make it 2x, by getting rid of rules and regulations? Why not make it 3x by getting rid of the 40 hour week? Why not make it 5x, by targeting a 20% net immigration every year? What is the right level of immigration anyway?

All of these things are decisions eminently the domain of a country's citizens. The backlash of the elites to a decision that might shave a couple points of economic growth in the short to medium term is indicative of the obsessive level of control they expect to exert over society. It's not a bad thing for the governing elites to be given a shock every now and then. ",2016-06-30 14:30:13+00:00,d4tzgpr,1.0,t3_4qlkda,4932.0,politics

It's probably too much for one person, unless they are hugely experienced. You might be able to make it own your own, maybe, but I think it is far more likely you get overwhelmed and give up. 

Here are a few major pieces of the architecture:

1. A front-end for the app. Can you build a basic app to display this thing? If not, start with programming skills here. 

2. A backend. Basically a database with the wiring to serve up data - pages, streams, comments, user profiles - to the front end. A huge area in and of itself.

3. A media server - google it. You can find media servers that you can pay a monthly fee for and are more or less plug-and-play (subject to being integrated with your backend and frontend). This is to turn all the various formats of incomming video into something that then gets displayed on your app / website.

1965,"**Late edit** For those commenting without seeing the video, the title is susceptible to confuse you, in two ways. First, it is a historical quote from a contemporary source writing in 1875. Second, the *use* of the quote here is deeply sardonic; Professor Blight is pointing out how misplaced the idea is that the ""questions that grew out of slavery"" had, by 1875, been ""fully and finally settled"". He is reflecting on two things here: one is the failure of will following the Civil War to continue the work of Reconstruction; the second is how vast an enterprise Reconstruction really is.

**Edit: [Here is the correct video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQOk4h4hhwo&amp;list=PL5DD220D6A1282057&amp;index=26) in the playlist that was intended to be linked, from which the quote is taken**

I wanted to bring to the attention of the readers of this sub this superb 27 part lecture series from Professor David Blight at Yale on the Civil War and Reconstruction. The discussion here yesterday about the failure of Reconstruction - and the failure of the curriculum to teach it - suggested some would be interested in learning more about this period of history.

Fully a third of Blight's course deals with the failure of Reconstruction. I have linked to one of the latter episodes in the lecture series just to share a 10 minute passage that stayed in my mind. 

There is no doubting the ferocity of Blight's feelings about this topic and it is certainly a case where understanding this period of history has enlightened my own understanding of more recent history, and of the present.",2016-06-17 11:13:57+00:00,d4cvplq,1.0,t3_4oiq7i,198.0,history

He's been given plenty the last 4 weeks, and the latest comments about how Obama is in cahoots with ISIS just show him flipping the desk. He's completely uncoachable.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the discussion was Kasie Hunt picking up on Trump's remarks that he ""may have to go it alone"". She thinks that he's foreshadowing the outcome of what have been actual discussions behind closed doors. 

It seems the RNC may have no choice but to cut him adrift completely. No money, no endorsements, a total Zombie candidate. I can't quite see how that still doesn't wound the party at least indirectly in terms of turn out.

I agree the Republicans are on the horns of an impossible dilemma. If I were in their shoes: I'd (1) change the rules to unpledge all the delegates, (2) put Ryan forward, (3) face a wrathful electorate in the hope that at least they'll pick Ryan over Hillary.

2004,"I'm at level 9 and honestly am not finding it too difficult. Level 9 is also much harder to face this problem vs level 8, because the resource cost for upgrades is much higher.

Here's my strategy - I am playing as Imperial.

1. Pick your targets when you attack. I generally try not to attack targets with less than 100k alloy and coin both. There were *lots* of these tagets at level 8. Strangely, there's fewer at level 9, maybe because players quitting the game. Point is, I will say no to 10 or 15 attacks sometimes all around 50-80k resources, to find one worthwhile. Of course you can do the 70k or 80k ones too.

2. I found Tatooine has many more players and higher likelihood of finding players with large loots to attack. Other planets, eg Hoth, was much more difficult.

3. It does take a couple of hour ""burst"" of activity to save up resources to go for an upgrade. So example, say I need 1 million alloy to upgrade something. I'll get to say 500k level on day one. Maybe I get attacked overnight, say go down to 300k because of 200k loss. So next day, I am starting at 300k - well I attack until I get the 1 million. Don't go to sleep or walk away from the game. Do it continuously so you're not attacked. And if you're attacking targets where you get on average 100k loot, well that's only 7 attacks you need to carry off. Takes 1-2 hours usually.

It's honestly not too bad.",2016-06-11 11:19:45+00:00,d44rswz,1.0,t3_4lxv1g,911209.0,Starwarscommander

I liked the clicker one. Just one comment if I may, which is intended to be more encouraging than it sounds. These are both very generic-y type apps. I imagine there are other clickers out there, and really the app store is a bit like Google search page for these things: the top 2 or 3 results are going to hover up all of the typed-in search queries. No one is going to scroll the page looking for these if they think they found something that fits the bill in the first couple of results.

Wrack these up to experience, and don't be disappointed or even surprised that they're being overlooked.

You ought to think about whether there are more distinctive things you can build and potentially charge for. You then have something that might justify some marketing effort to aid discoverability.

2019,"The article is worth reading. There are some good points, and the proposal to increase bank capital adequacy requirements is an interesting one, that *may* counterweight the need for more direct government regulation.

The same can be said for creating a new bankruptcy regime for large bank insolvencies.

The devil in all this is in the detail. I am skeptical of them setting capital adequacy requirements at a level that really can protect banks from collapse under the kind of pressures seen in 2007-8. Even A rated securities were deeply impaired in that crisis. 

The problem is you need true prophylactics. An attitude like this is just utterly naive:

&gt; “Some large firms will likely become smaller because the credit they now obtain will be priced according to their inherent risk of failure without implicit government guarantees,” Hensarling said in his New York speech. “As a result, failure—when it does happen—will be more contained.”

Anyone who knows anything about the credit markets in 2005-2006 knows that they were *totally* mispricing risk, and the bankers at the big banks *totally* didn't care enough to take their foot off the gas. ""When the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance"", said the Citi CEO famously just after (of even before) the crash of September 2008, referring to the execissive risk taking during the bubble.

Big financial institutions with CDO obligations many times the GDP of the country is a baaad place to be. To have an attitude that ""the market will constrain them"" by correctly pricing risk is contadicted by the evidence of the first bubble. Therefore, a policy premised on ""Let them fail"" is misguided, because if the financial system is still allowed to have a situation where the collapse of a handful of institutions threatens to collapse all of them, it'll be 2008 again and you'll either have to bail them out or have a depression.

&gt; 
&gt; So, from a cursory read of the article we already know the headline statistic is off by 300% and is clearly sensational.

Now who's being sensational. You bolded the error rate (300%), and didn't bother bolding the actual important bit - it's an employment rate of 0.9%.

The ""300%"" is a classic abuse of statistics. It's like saying you have a 300% higher change of winning the lottery on your birthday. Or that you have **10 times** the chance of dying in an airplane collision if your name starts with J.

These are big headline numbers that obscure (and are intended to obscure) the real underlying statistics.

Headline here suggests 0.3. Your calcs show 0.9. 

Headline is mostly accurate; the shitty use of stats is yours.

You either have that or you have a ""Let them all come"" approach which is that advocated by asylum seeker advocates who flip their minds over the idea that countries should have borders.

""In any other way"". You say it as though being successful in the first way doesn't count. So then, what value do you put on advertising, a trillion dollar industry? People pay what they do for advertising because getting peoples' attention is hard. That's what Trump does. It may not be a business like Bill Gates' or Steve Jobs', but is it one modality of business success. If you don't think that's a type of business success why don't you start a business marketing assets based on nothing but your own name recognition and tell us how you get on.

&gt; Look at his record of bankruptcies and failures. 

It happens in business. Bankruptcy is there (and particularly in the particular flavor it is in the United States) to encourage entrepreneurial risk-taking. You can make big bets, and it's not a death sentence if you fail. It is part and parcel of America's entrepreneurial culture. (Cf: about 90% of Silicon Valley startups in the last decade. The entire premise of that culture is there is no disgrace in failure).

&gt; Honestly, if your dad left your hundreds of millions of dollars, turning that into $1 billion over 30 years is not an accomplishment. 

Wasn't it like $1 million when he started? And he was pretty much already a household name in the US before he received his father's inheritance. So taking $1 million to achieve the prominence and branding he did is trivial? It's a serious accomplishment. Again, show me how easy it is if anyone can do it.

As I say, is he Steve Jobs? No. Hell, I don't even like his brand or his 'style'. But to deny that he has accomplished a large amount of business success seems churlish.

2200,"I'd make a decision: Where do you want to end up working primarily - web, or mobile?

If you want mobile, stick to a native mobile platform. First, Ruby is not (to my knowledge) something that has compilers for building mobile apps. So, for that part of your question the answer is ROR is not the droid you're looking for. Second, there are languages which do have serious compilers into mobile built for them: JavaScript is one (the compiler is Cordova (open source) / Phonegap (Adobe flavored Cordova) and the other is C# (or C++?) compiled by Xamarin (sp?). This is built by Windows.

The promise of these platforms is ""write once, run everywhere"". I would exercise a lot of caution. In javascript, I still think that is something of a hollow promise. There are a wall of issues, and some very difficult problems arise when you think you will also need UI layers for these apps, for which you will have to program responsive CSS without the benefit of native UI kits. There has been some development in this area (see: Ionic framework) but like so much of Javascript, what seems to be a platform quickly reveals itself to be a building built on shifting sands. In Ionic's case, those shifting sands are that it is built on Angular framework. And Angular is itself in the middle of a rewrite.

I spent (wasted?) several months looking at all of this, and by the end, I just couldn't get the fuck out of there quickly enough. Add, on top of all that, general javascript ecosystem fuck-a-about-ery. (Google: javascript fatigue). It is not an environment, and the web generally is not a production environment, I would easily recommend to anyone who isn't already up the curve (aka, have the benefit / misfortune of already being in the middle of that entire shitstorm called webdev).

I'm sorry if this sounds jaded. This is all very subjective and for me - there are just more pleasant ways of earning a living. You may find the rapid pace of change (aka total chaos) of webdev gets your juices flowing, idk).

That leaves - for cross-platform development - Xamarin. It's being heavily invested in by Microsoft. That is a very, very good sign after the zoo of open source javascript. I have heard really good things about it (I can't tell whether the commenters are paid shills or just zealous converts, but they act like missionaries these people). I would at least check it out. DO query: how good is the UI support, what is the UI development process like, and how much of a headache is producing UI on each of iOS and Android going to be (because UI is not something you can skimp on in today's app markets).

Also, make sure you're comfortable with going into C# / C++ (I forget which). They have a reputation for being  *slightly* more difficult (I am talking about things like ""pointers"") but I am sure the people on here experienced in those languages will say that's not a big a deal as it is made out to be.).

If you don't like the look of those, go Java for Android or Swift for iOS.

But yeah, Ruby is not going to help you for making hybrid mobile apps. And to the extent Javascript does (seem to) offer that help - it's really not there yet, and it's a shitstorm anyway.",2016-05-18 12:23:42+00:00,d3a422a,1.0,t3_4jvmvq,15045.0,learnprogramming

I would really advise better uses of your time now. It is far far more important that you:

1. Do well enough academically to put yourself in the running for law school - but that's really all you need to do at this stage.
2. Get to know yourself and anything else that might conceivably appeal to you. Going in to law will open up some career avenues for you. It will close off others. You want to make a good choice.

**PAUL KRUGMAN**

**What he said then**

* Writes, three days after the collapse of Lehman Bros, that the knock on effects of the collapse left him [""terrified as a citizen"".](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/less-than-zero/) 
* Writes in 2008 in the midst of the ""worst crisis since the 30s"" of the need to reign in the ""out of control financial system"", ""before the next crisis"". (In a delicious irony, the piece is titled [""Lest we forget""](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/opinion/28krugman.html?_r=0).) 

* In the same article, he issues this warning:
&gt; Once the economy is on the road to recovery, the wheeler-dealers will be making easy money again — and will lobby hard against anyone who tries to limit their bottom lines.

* On the day Lehman filed for bk in 2008, complains against a financial system in which ""it’s starting to look as if the rule is heads you win, tails the taxpayers lose.""

* Continues with the theme during the fall crisis of 2008 that the banks ought to be nationalised. In a presentation to Princeton University, [stated:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj_JNwNbETA&amp;t=54m15s) 
&gt; Financial crises always end with a big government bailout. The only question is whether it will lead to a resonable deal for the taxpayer.

* Complains in the wake of Lehman's collapse that the Treasury's plan to support the financial system [""[offer's] no quid pro quo here — nothing that gives taxpayers a stake in the upside, nothing that ensures that the money is used to stabilize the system rather than reward the undeserving""](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/no-deal/)

* In 2011, in a piece with no less a title than [""Oligarchy, American Style""](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/opinion/oligarchy-american-style.html)  writes a lengthy essay entirely premised on (i) the proven fact of inequality, (ii) it's growing importance, and (iii) its threat to the very existence of democracy:
&gt; Inequality is back in the news, largely thanks to Occupy Wall Street, but with an assist from the Congressional Budget Office. And you know what that means: It’s time to roll out the obfuscators! Anyone who has tracked this issue over time knows what I mean. Whenever growing income disparities threaten to come into focus, a reliable set of defenders tries to bring back the blur. Think tanks put out reports claiming that inequality isn’t really rising, or that it doesn’t matter. Pundits try to put a more benign face on the phenomenon, claiming that it’s not really the wealthy few versus the rest, it’s the educated versus the less educated. So what you need to know is that all of these claims are basically attempts to obscure the stark reality: **We have a society in which money is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people, and in which that concentration of income and wealth threatens to make us a democracy in name only.**

&gt; feedback loop between political and market power. Rising wealth at the top buys growing political influence, via campaign contributions, lobbying, and the rewards of the revolving door. Political influence in turn is used to rewrite the rules of the game—antitrust laws, deregulation, changes in contract law, union-busting—in a way that reinforces income concentration. The result is a sort of spiral, a vicious circle of oligarchy.

2330,"Hey thanks for the detailed thoughts.

My perspective would be very different had I already been in the industry. Angular is a very good example of this. If you're already in, you've probably been using 1.x for several years. Going to 2.0 is a pain but just an incremental step.

If you're a total beginner, you're being advised to learn 1.x for the first time (because that's where the overwhelming number of jobs remain) in the knowledge you're going to have to pick up 2.0 as well.

The incremental additions for someone already up the curve is one thing; I'd probably find it doable if it was just adding things as they come up. Being a beginner looking at the full stack right now though, and all the production add-ons, yeah it's just a huge mountain and I think there are easier ways to live.

On the Xamarin, I had a very bad experience with ""write once, deploy everywhere"" on Meteor. This is a platform that promises to deploy on the web and an most major mobile app stores using web views. You can imagine just how attractive a proposition that sounded, and it really was the biggest attraction to going full steam ahead with javascript. Only after I made a significant investment in learning that environment, I found out that the UI layer is just an absolute nightmare. If you are unwilling to learn Angular as well, which has a UI wrapper for mobile called Iconic, then you're having to do hand rolled mobile interfaces.

That honestly was the last straw for me in that ecosystem.

I don't know if the UI issue is the same in Xamarin but the Meteor experience was so disappointing it has made me very wary of run-everywhere platforms now.

2336,"This hits home for me very hard.

I set my sights on a career change about a year ago. I come from a professional background, three degrees, but not STEM. Programming seemed like the biggest, most unapproachable black box to me. Like, it was something for people who went to Harvard or Stanford, or you did it since you were 10 years old ddossing government sites. Those were the only routes in. I think most of the population still has something of this view of the guild nature of programming.

But then I stumbled on /r/learnprogramming and found it really encouraged me to try it out. I can't tell you what it was like building my first html and css site. It was like someone had just given me a book of magic spells. It was just crazy - like, wow, you can do this? And some people get paid to do this?

A year later and all of that sparkle and enjoyment, well, it's still there on the occassions I think of throwing up a static personal site for a bit of fun. But in terms of doing this as a career, nfw. As I progressed in my learning, it was just buckling under the weight of bootstrap and node and sass and then meteor, and realising the whole thing is just thrown together gaffa tape and I have not even scratched the surface yet in terms of building anything complex.

I'm trying now to rekindle my naive interest in software development by learning iOS. I hope I don't sound like a cop out. I know iOS itself is changing - like I'm learning Swift 2.0, bracing for Swift 3.0, and have the thought that I'll need to learn a bit of Obj C. 

But, well, a human can keep up with that change. You can spend time in that ecosystem and actually program, not read shitty articles on new frameworks everyday, and articles complaining about those new frameworks (as enjoyable as this entire thread has been).

Yesterday, Paul Krugman did a disgraceful hit piece on Bernie, in which Krugman made some of the most startling claims to anyone familiar with his (Krugman's) earlier work.

Among those claims were that:

* The banks did not cause the financial crisis
* Banks like Lehman Bros weren't really that big and therefore didn't need regulating.

All of this was pressed into service of Krugman's increasingly personal and unprincipled attacks to prop up the interests of his employers and discredit Sanders' campaign.

Just one problem. Krugman had previously written - before he started shilling for Hillary -

* That the banks were such a danger to the economy they ought to have been nationalised, and
* The collapse of Lehman Bros almost brought down the world economy.

This video walks you through Krugman's startling transformation - from someone who spent years writing about the danger of the banking system, and the danger of the American oligarchy, and the dangers of money in politics - to someone who is now waging what can only be described as a propaganda campaign of breathtaking mendacity.",2016-04-09 04:15:00+00:00,d1vuaaf,1.0,t3_4dzy9r,297.0,SandersForPresident

2373,"I wrote a lengthy review on FCC a few weeks back, as an intermediate learner looking to work out my JavaScript skills a bit more. 

I skipped over the first two projects because I've advanced (well) beyond that level, but I did take a glance at them. From what I saw you definitely had the material you needed to complete those, if you glanced back at what you covered in the course. Reference to outside material I don't think was really necessary, but that shouldn't be an issue anyway. 

I would strongly, strongly encourage you to go back and try them again without looking at the code. There is simply no other way to cement the knowledge you gain by trying it out. Trying stuff out and having to nut out why it DOESNT WORK is a bigger part of the process than you think. Nothing lays bare all the misunderstandings and false assumptions you have than seeing things fuck up on the screen in ways you never imagined. 

I am working on a fairly big personal project of my own right now and I can tell you ""Why the fuck didn't that come up in the way I thought it would"" is about 50% of my working time at the moment trying to layout some complex pages. 

You're going to have to embrace this sooner or later. It is really driven by a basic sense of inquisitiveness without which I don't think it's possible to become a developer. 

You are shortchanging yourself and I can guarantee you that typing in someone else's code and going ""yeah that all makes sense"" is not even 10 or even 5 percent of the learning you do when you look at a blank code editor and start typing code where you are almost certain not to get it right but over a few hours you wrestle order out of the chaos. 

The only excuse would be if you didn't even have the basic concepts, the basic vocabulary to even begin to process what it is you want to achieve. Like giving you a code editor and asking you to program up a node sever isn't something you're just going to come up with with no prior knowledge  

But I do think FCC had given you the basic tools you need - the basic ingredients if you like - to throw together those personal projects they set up for you. So no excuses there. You may want to go back over the lessons and refamiliarise yourself with what they have taught, making a mental note as you go of the bits that you'll be needing to compose the project in your mind's eye.

There's really no avoiding having to get your hands dirty in writing your own code. That's where you want to end up anyway, so the longer you put it off the more time you're wasting. 

Good luck. PM me if you get stuck.

If you're referring more to the algorithm challenges my answer is slightly different. Yes try and solve it, go back over the previous lessons that seem applicable (eg array methods) and look up MDN documentation. But if then you just can't nut it out then ofc look up the solution. But try this - don't just copy out the solution code straight away. Try it yourself after you notice what the key methods or techniques were used in the answer. See if you can construct the whole thing yourself",2016-04-06 14:23:02+00:00,d1s4p9l,1.0,t3_4dl017,18403.0,learnprogramming

2380,"&gt; I am understanding everything, but it is seeming more and more complicated. I just learned how to build a program that has the user guess a randomly generated number, and then provide multiple outcomes using else if statements, such as providing hints. 

I did Treehouse and I remember that particular challenge. Don't worry too much about this. That one in particular had quite a few things going on - there was the whole Math.floor, Math.random and the + 1 thing, then the prompts and alerts, and the if/else testing. It's not something that I would expect many people just to belt out on the first way through.

These patterns will become more familiar to you - eg, if / else, and especially cycling through for loops. Some you'll internalise, others you'll just know are out there and look them up when needed.

The real question I'd be asking here is not whether you nutted this out yourself, but could you understand the answer once you had it? If so, keep going. ",2016-04-04 05:33:01+00:00,d1p15fs,1.0,t3_4d994h,9310.0,learnprogramming

2453,"&gt; the feeling of being something better just because being born in a rich country is so strong everywhere.

This is the problem I have with crusaders like you. You see the world strictly in terms of black and white. 

First of all, this:

&gt; I used to vote right wing until I began to travel and saw the misery in this world.

I saw it when I travelled the world as a child. Look at my comment history - and especially the gilded comments. I am on most issues pretty left wing. 

You mean to imply that travel has given you an open mind but you rush to judgment assuming I must be right wing because I am in favor of borders. It's also implicit in your apparent boast that you've travelled, as if only someone who hasn't travelled could believe in immigration restrictions? That's not very open minded, is it? You'd be shocked to know I've lived in three continents and hold two passports, one Asian, one European. I think you should spend some time in the mirror and realize you're not as open minded as you think you are.

The prosperity, the security, the freedoms we enjoy depend on our borders at this moment in history. Guess what - the rest of the world wants to come and live in the west. And if we let them come in an uncontrolled fashion, we will destroy the aspects of our societies that make the west such an attractive destination to the rest of the world.

I keep hearing refugee advocates like yourselves go on and on about the suffering of the refugees, but you never seem to have an awareness of the suffering going on in the rest of the world. What do you propose doing about that? Is it enough that anyone suffering should be able to claim refugee status? If not, you're granting privilege to a handful at the expense of the great majority.

We cannot let everyone in. Do you even acknoledge that? If so, where do you propose we draw the line? Because you're deliberately being cruel then to those you leave out.

I'm sorry that I can't promise lollypops and candyfloss for the entire world. We just can't. It took us a thousand years of fucking war and struggle to build our own societies. We can't take on that work for the entire world.

In the end, I don't think you show any appreciation for the fact that the world is a complex place, and just crying about the poor and the suffering and having the response ""Let them all come"" is a terribly unsophisticated way of trying to solve a difficult problem.",2016-03-22 12:22:28+00:00,d1913jm,7.0,t1_d190lie,1282.0,worldnews

Do this AFTER you polish your existing site. You could then put your services on freelancing sites -- and then show those works off in your portfolio.

There is NO reason why you cannot make a career as a freelancer if you come up the curve on design a bit, or as a back-end engineer if you pursue that and keep adding that to your portfolio.

This is the thread by which your entire comment hangs though. And very obviously one of the main ingredients in a successful revolution by arms is the co-operation or at least acquiesence of the military. That's why the military is coveted by dictators.

You need only look to the Arab Spring revolutions to see that in evidence. It was the refusal of the Egyptian military to fire on the protestors in Tahrir Square that allowed that revolution to succeed. For the opposite result, see Tianamen Square.

No violent revolution is even on the cards in the US, that's not what Sanders' movement is. It's a political revolution, not a violent revolution. But to answer your broader question, no, no violent revolution in the US could succeed unless it had the backing of the military. But history shows that's not as impossible as it sounds.

EDIT: To elaborate. Your point is people are going to be disappointed if they think Bernie's going to get in there and start implementing all of his policies on day one. My response is, first, of course I get the division of powers in government, and that puts barriers in the way of government by decree. 

But second, it is misguided to assume that this will not lead to a profound political change towards the direction of the policies Bernie is talking about. People always mistake projections of the future by modelling things as static versions of the present, with only the variables they are looking at being different. ""Bernie is President but everything else is the same"". Reality is dynamic. Bernie becomming President doesn't just make Bernie President, it changes a whole host of things. Starting with the turnout of those college kids voting down the ticket in the Congressional elections in the general. And a much, much larger change in the conversation in the country, and the market for the progressive ideas he is campaigning on. There has not been a market in the US for those ideas since 1980.

Third, you are also underestimating the shape and time of forces of history. One President may only do so much. But the historical forces Bernie represents were unleased in the US in the Occupy Wall Street movement (in terms of equality) and the Civil Rights Movement (in terms of racial equality) and the feminist movement of the 70s in terms of gender equality. (In fact, there's a historian at Yale - David Blight - who regards **everything** happening in Civil Rights to this day as a continuation of the work that was unfinished in Reconstruction).

You think the hedge fund classes are just going to go ""Oh yeah, we'll pay our taxes, fair's fair"".

It doesn't work that way. The good news is, what Bernie is proposing doesn't require a single drop of blood to be spilt. You just need to phonebank and get the college kids to turn up.

2544,"Hi, former lawyer here. I'll happily have a look at your or anyone else's contracts in exchange for intermediate-advance js lessons, pound for pound!

Ok, so this isn't formal legal advice as you're not a client, but here are some top level look outs. 

Starting point: Where do you start in these things? Start with the commercial deal. What do you want, and what do they want. That will tell you where you need to drill down.

1. Profit share. They earn 60%, you earn 40%. Great, you just took a whole bunch of problems off the table! If you were a lender, you'd be going in opposite directions. But you're both getting profit, which means you should both be rowing in the same direction. This is a good start and a more important point than it seems. You'll be surprised how often this resolves issues - you both want to do well in the same way.

Now, here are some real issues:

a. How do you know what your 40% cut is?
i Are there any issues around the definition of ""revenues""? 
ii. How are their expenses calculated? Is there anything murky in those definitions? Is their internal overhead counted? If so, that had better be a fixed cost (per month etc), otherwise the venture may never see a ""profit"".
iii. How will you get reports? How often, and what is the quality of the information?

2. What is the legal form of the agreement. If you are simply licensing the rights, you may not need a specialised subsidiary. Equally, you may not want or need to become a director - but that is useful in terms of you having a seat at the table and observing what's going on.

3. Always check out the laws on director liability in your local jurisdiction any time you think of taking a directorship. You don't want to be liable for debts if the thing trades fraudulently or insolvently. Directorship has a lot going for it, for good business reasons, but it is something to be respectful of in that it is a serious legal office and should be treated as such. Educate yourself on this anyway from your local companies registrar.

Also, if it is a company, note there are two ways of getting you your money: Either it can be license payments under the licence; or profit distributions in the form of dividends from the company. There's a big difference in documenting these; licence (contract) payments are much better than corporate dividends, because for corporate dividends there is then a whole corporate machinery inside the company that you have to make sure works (including if things go hostile). You should prefer contract payments when you can get them.

4. Exclusive licence. Be careful anytime you enter an exclusive licence. The issue here is always defining when you can get the licence back. What if they underpeform? Should there be a benchmark of actual sales they need to meet, or other indicia of effot? You need to be able to pull the licence if they're complete duds, or if they just give up trying.

Exclusive licences *really* need to be documented clearly.

These are just a few things to hopefully get you thinking in the right direction. Similar to programming, thinking like a lawyer is all about hanging thoughts on and around much larger structures. It's the structures that you're looking for. Everything else is then just plain html skin.

If they are a serious outfit they should already have a serious document that lays most of this out. No one writes these contracts coming up with a definition of ""revenue"" from complete scratch. 

Hopefully that means the job of your counsel can be kept pretty short in reviewing it.

If you'd like a chat about it offline either in general terms, or once you are looking at documents, ping me a PM. Once again, I can't agree to formally legally advise you, because I won't be licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction for one thing.

Even if you *do* make it, it is a shitty way to organize a society. It is mathematically impossible for 100% of people to pull themselves into the 1%, or the 5%, or the 10%, no matter how hard they work, or how many qualifications they attain. There is only an arms race between them, where the winners take all the prizes, and everyone else gets thrown on the scrap heap.

Some people have to clean the streets, and drive the buses, and serve the fast food, and nurse people, and clean the hotel rooms, and serve the drinks at the bars, and stock the groceries in the stores - do all those things that you, when you've made it, will be demanding they do.

If every person in society had Law degrees and MBAs from Harvard, those jobs would be filled by people holding those degrees. Society cannot function with bankers and lawyers alone.

Do people who fulfill those other roles in society deserve dignity? Do they deserve to nourish themselves, and enjoy any leisure? Do they deserve to feed and educate their children, and hope they can follow their share of the American dream? Do they deserve to be cared for when they get sick?

**Healthcare** We're gonna get rid of Obamacare which is such garbage. We're going to have something much better. I have the best healthcare. We're not gonna let people die on the streets.

**Education** We're getting rid of common core folks. Just a load of garbage. We're going to have local education curriculums. 

**Trade policy** We're always losing, losing, losing. Now we're going to be winning, winning, winning. We're going to tear up these trade pacts that have been such garbage. Really, just a load of junk. We're going to have much better ones. They're going to be great.
By the way, I love the Chinese, they're terrific people. The biggest tenant in my building is from China! They're fantastic payers! But lemme tell you, they've been killing us these guys. We'll that's gonna stop.

**Jobs** We have the best jobs plan. Really, it's going to be great.

**Taxes** We're going to cut taxes and the economy is going to boom. I'm going to cut the waste. Waste, waste, waste - if you saw all the waste going on you wouldn't believe it. There's some ... EPA programs ... I'm going to start with some EPA cuts. Gong to cut the EPA! You're going to love it.

**Middle East** No more foreign wars folks. No! You know why? We're going to have the best military. The strongest military like you wouldn't believe. I am the strongest of all the candidates on the military. And when people see how strong our military is, believe me - they ain't going to be trying anything. That's why we won't need to do any more foreign wars. Terrible for this country they are. But we're not having them any more.

2619,"The cynics are trying to tell you you are throwing good money away.

Let me say a few things about that - one obvious, but a bigger point that is perhaps less so.

First, this competition is very much alive. Most of you have read the post from 538 saying Sanders may well lose ground over coming weeks but still come back strongly and potentially win the thing in the clutch. Nothing about S.C. seals this by any shot.

Second, there is a bigger fight here. This is the first time in **thirty years** that I have been following politics I have ever seen a candidate for President even mention the words democratic socialism, much less the concrete proposals Sanders has, for a fundamentally fairer society. One where people can educate their children, and the social welfare net exists not just for big banks, but for hard working Americans, as it was designed to in FDR's day.

Barack Obama has a saying about gun control that is illustrative of a broader point. He said: ""Americans will get gun control when they want it."" Do you remember the quote? He's said it on a number of occasions. Often in a forlorn type of way. 

He's saying: There's only so far Washington can lead the people. There's only so much he can do as President. Or Congress leaders can do beyond the terrain that challengers to their positions would take up.

**The grass roots matter.** The American people set the agenda, whether they consciously know it or not. To put it in the Spanish proverb: Money makes the dog dance.

Beyond anything this campaign achieves - and it's not over - never forget this: **You are showing a generation of politicians that there is an electorate out there for these policies. That there is money out there to back candidates pushing for these things.**

Don't think that other candidates lining themselves up for shots in 2020 and further on aren't going to notice. Marilyn Warren has to be doing the calculations. A future Barack Obama maybe is also preparing to line up their voting record behind these types of policies.

Your dollars are economic votes. In any capitalist system, when the demand appears, the supply will always materialize to meet it.

Don't ever let the cynics dissuade you or erode your passion. The march of progressivism is long, and there is a long way to go. This fight - and your contributions of time and money - is putting down solid pavement for future politicians to follow.

But saying people wishing to learn to code should start with university mathematics is a sure way to build frustration and deter people from taking up programming in the first place.

NB: I'm not critizing OP's intentions or even his actual advice that this stuff is useful. I would just be loath to suggest to others that this is by any means necessary to become - in some fashion - someone who can code productively and with enjoyment.",2016-02-17 10:05:49+00:00,d031ku8,2.0,t1_d02xx6l,12618.0,learnprogramming

If you're just there for a visit, make sure to hire a bike. (If you're there to live, you'll be buying one). It is cycle friendly as it gets and it's a great way to see the city, especially the inner part.

For activities, again if you're just visiting, try walking tours for the history, the clubbing (if you're into that, not my thing) is meant to be legendary, and there's plenty of good bars around for other nightlife.

I visited for a few days years ago and ended up moving there for several years. It's really a place that's about the ""vibe"" and the way of living.

Course Summary

Familiarity with basic programming at the level of Stanford's CS106B is required, particularly in Python. Some exposure to HTML, CSS, and Javascript will also be helpful. Students who have previously taken the Autumn 2015 versions of CS251 and CS251P will have more context, but this course is primarily new material.

    Introduction to Bitcoin. Introduction to basic Bitcoin concepts such as transactions, digital signatures, the blockchain, and mining.

    Introduction to Bitcoin Computing. Introduction to Bitcoin micropayments. Learn how to transparently add micropayments to any web service using payment gateways that implement the HTTP 402 error code. Gain experience by running and then modifying several demo apps.

    Hack Week 1. A free week for your creativity. Extend any of the micropayments demos that you've worked with over the previous week to add new functionality, or build a new one entirely.

    Bitcoin Instagram. Develop an app that allows you to set a price on your Instagram photos and build a machine-payable stock photo search engine. Project: after getting this to work, experiment with monetizing your user-generated content on other services.

    Bitcoin Twitter. Develop an app that allows you to accept micropayments for making retweets. Add permissions and filters to ensure you only promote content that’s interesting to your followers. Project: experiment with paid endorsements on your other social networks.

    Bitcoin WordPress. Develop an app that lets you monetize your blog by charging a small micropayment for each page view. Project: place the same micropayments wrapper around other types of content, like wikis or database result pages.

    Hack Week 2. A free week for your creativity. Extend any of the code that you've worked with over the previous weeks to add new functionality, or build a new demo entirely.

    Bitcoin Linux. Develop a command line program that outsources part of its code to the cloud, charging micropayments for each use. Project: build your own simple machine-payable command line app.

    Bitcoin Google. Develop a simple web search engine funded not by ad views but by micropayments, turning the primary customer into the user rather than the advertiser. Project: extend the search functionality to search other kinds of content.

    Bitcoin Dropbox. Develop a file server that charges clients per byte with precision even below a single satoshi (below $0.000004 USD) using Bitcoin micropayment channels. Project: build other kinds of grid computing services with fine-grained micropayments.

The thing I think people in the US don't get when they talk about ""socialised"" medicine, is this. **You can still go private if you wish**. You are NOT stuck with the government health system as your only health provider. If you are wealthy, you can opt-in to the private health system, which of course, costs a premium. You want to see a doctor of your choice, at a time of your convenience? That'll be 45 pounds a visit. You want to see a doctor in the public system, at a time they can fit you in? Then that's free.

This system works so well that in fact here in Australia, you are *penalised* by the tax system if you are 'wealthy' (top 5-10%) and you *don't* take out private health insurance. That penalty is of course redirected back into the funding of the public system. It's like, you can still go public and it will always be there for you, but you really ought to go private at your own extra (insurance) cost, to alleviate pressure on the public system.

I have, for most of my life, been in the private system. I just love the public systems in both countries. I love the idea that my compatriots are not stuck having to sew up their own injuries or whatever. It boils down to having a level of compassion for your other countrymen, or rather, a set of standards you want to define your country by.

TLDR: The idea that socialised medicine excludes getting your own private insurance and private treatment is a scare tactic sold by your incredibly misanthropic health insurance industry.",2015-12-27 13:18:31+00:00,cycp7gh,3.0,t1_cycnvb1,6339.0,politics

&gt; If anyone has any learning resources for any MVC JS framework

My suggestion: try learning Meteor. Meteor is well known for the approachability of its templating library, Blaze. (*Ignore ignore ignore* for now the whole ""React replacing Blaze"" discussion that you will encounter. People who know these things have advised Blaze is going to be around a while yet, and jumping into React is *not* the easy approachability I'm suggesting Meteor to you for).

From all reports, this combo seems to be a lot more approachable to get your head around what MVC is and how it works. You might then find it easier getting the hang of Angular (where most all of the jobs are, at least in my region). Angular has a somewhat tough reputation for its learning curve.

2897,"&gt;  I'm thinking of learning HTML and CSS so I can get into web design.

Ok, time for a talk about the facts of life.

The path you are talking about is front-end web development. You know what is so great about that? The ability to put anything at all you want (well, within your capabilities) up on the internet. That is a serious ability in a world where most of our storytelling and narratives these days occur on the web. It's a genuinely useful skill to have a least some ability in I believe. At the very least, I'd encourage anyone to spend at least a little time in that ecosystem, if not to get good at it, to at least see what's inside the black box, and realise it's a skill they could acquire in fairly short time if they ever need it.

In your position, most people will say if you want to go down this path, HTML and CSS aren't languages, and you should focus on the execution programming language javascript. I'm going to take a different approach. CSS is, it is true, not a programming language, and in fact it is *deceptive* how difficult that field is. Trivial to begin with, very very difficult to master. I'm talking agency built websites that are 3000+ lines of CSS. It really isn't for everyone working in that area. 

In terms of career, again, it's got great benefits. A chronic skilled worker deficiency that doesn't look like being filled anytime soon, especially as legacy B2B desktop software migrates massively over to webapps for ease of maintainability.

On the other hand, the pace of change in that field is exhausting. Just literally ... you can''t explain it. Have a look at smashingmagazine.com and browse through it. While front-end webdev is a modest stack (HTML, CSS, JS), the actual ecosystem is teeming with life in the form of frameworks and libraries that are ever changing. There is a site I believe that has a  counter showing how many days it's been since someone released a new js framework. 

There was a good thread on here I'll try and dig up, but it had a lot of grizzled old veterans saying how glad they were doing back-end work when they saw the carnage their front-end colleagues go through trying to keep up. 

As a total newbie to programming a year ago, that's too where I came out, with a preference for back-end work if I was going to continue with js. 

Some people in front end might say it may look like a zoo on the outside, but once you have you're feet under the desk in a job, you're probably only dealing with one framework and a handfull of libraries that only change at the same pace as you'd find elsewhere in software. Maybe that's true, but there's still a ton of extras you want to have a handle on and that's what did it for me.

EDIT: Still come back to my top part of the comment though: It is quite fun and not a difficult thing to dip your toe into these waters, and a good thing to be able to think about or discuss intelligibly. So if you're talking about an investment of time that is like a side-project to your main curriculum at school, I still say you should give it a try, and now's in fact a good time to do it.",2015-12-16 07:37:25+00:00,cy0srl2,1.0,t3_3x1u5o,2810.0,learnprogramming
2898,"Yes. If you want to add a front-end capability to do things on the web, all roads lead to javascript. No need to decide now which if any frameworks you want to combine that with (you'll have plenty of time to immerse yourself in those debates and come to a decision).

On the larger issue, I achieved *some* proficiency in javascript, before deciding to go in a different direction and learn swift to do iOS programming. I am really finding the benefits of knowing one language and reinforcing my understanding of both as I study a second. Ie, learning swift is not just benefiting from previous language knowledge, but seeing many of the same concepts discussed in different ways - OOP, closures etc - is really helping fill in things I had a tenuous hold on in JS.

In hindsight, while I understand the encouragement to ""get good"" at one language first, I have found the process of learning a second is somewhat complementary to just being a better programmer.

2957,"So, he managed to cover what should have been a basic point of economics, as the 5th edit of his post, after people told him he hadn't thought of it. Again, just shows what shitty analysis his preceding commentary was.

And as for his comments on that point:

&gt; Edit 5 To the ""Sales would rise because people would have more money to spend"" responses. Sure, assuming that there is the same demand or greater for McDonalds with people who make higher incomes. McDonalds customers don't go there for high quality - they go there because its cheap &amp; fast. Keep in mind, living expenses such as utilities/rents/etc won't go up as dramatically with minimum wage hikes - so the new $15/hr earners will be able to put a higher percentage of their income towards food. Do you think people with a lot more money to spend on food will be flocking to spend it at MickyDs? Maybe, or maybe they'll switch to higher quality/healthier options. People will still buy fast food - but they're probably going to want to buy higher-quality junky fast food than McDonalds currently has to offer.

This isn't anything resembling economic analysis.

The whole thing is a guy propping up a bar. I'm really sorry that this passes for economics in your book.",2015-11-29 07:12:51+00:00,cxgkcxn,5.0,t1_cxgit2b,4370.0,explainlikeimfive
2958,"TP did an accounting exercise without as much as even a sideways glance at economics. ANY economic post (and I have a Bachelors) would start first by asking what is the effect of all that new money in the economy going to do to aggregate demand (generally) and demand for McDonalds food (specifically). And you are not talking about the money on its first spend (by the minimum wage earner), but each subsequent spend.

You would then go on to analyse things like the marginal propensity to spend, adjusted for different income groups, and things like the amount of excess capacity in the economy, and the marginal cost of production. (Think all that new money is simply going to increase inflation? Wrong).

So yeah, TP hasn't touched on a single point that any very basic economic analysis would, and he makes a case that only sounds slightly sophisticated enough to take in people too uneducated on the specific topic to question the absence of this analysis.

Edit: If you really do have a BA in Economics, and thought TP was a ""phenomenal ELI5"", I'd seek a remission for your student loans, because you didn't seem to have taken away any actual economics.

We have no dog in that fight, and it's not our responsibility to take everyone off the African continent because a few teenagers are running around in the back of Toyotas with some AK-47s, and everyone locally reacts by not challenging them but simply saying, fuck it, I'd rather go and live in Italy.",2015-11-11 06:42:29+00:00,cwwaf4a,5.0,t1_cwvr0z8,34346.0,worldnews
3019,"Make something simple. Really really simple.

This was my first app:

- Have a button, labbelled ""start""
- Have a button, labelled ""stop""
- Have a &lt;p&gt; in a nice big div in the middle of the page. 
- When you pressed start, the text read: ""This is the start text"". 
- When you pressed stop, the text changed to ""This is the stop text"".

This was my first ever program I wrote the whole thing for. The key for me was, it was small and therefore *the problems were extremely discrete*. 

Start with something small, small, small. You are after, I think, programs that raise only a tiny number of very very discrete problems. Because then you know what you need to tackle.

Then, you can build this out. You can make all sorts of things start happening. Ultimately, anything with buttons and a main body text field, you're heading in the right direction to build a quiz now. How do you get the text field to generate some random questions? Well, you're into arrays, and you're into building a randomiser function. How do you get the buttons to show the answers that apply to that question? How do you know if the button pressed is the right answer? How do you remove that question from the array of questions once it's answered.

DON'T TRY AND BUILD THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE. Just take the first one, solve that. Then solve the next one. Then keep going until you finish the whole thing.

While you're doing that, keep reading / watching generally, for more functionality of js you want to master. Can you think of another incremental project to test out those capabilities?

But it wouldn't be funny (to us anyway) if it didn't target some tropes so effectively. And it really covers quite a few Australian types, so you'll get a better overall glimpse of things.

I would add a proximity boundry to the timing of holes opening up - ie, ball must be not less than x tiles away. Keeps it as game of skill, because you then have a chance to avoid them.

The biggest issue seems to me: should this be like an Ikea kit (ie - supply your own tablet device, that slots in easily), or a whole plug-in-and-play (where you supply the tablet).

I guess there's a whole bunch of those type issues you need to surmount first. And the gesture recognition could be a very big one.

Context:
*This is why Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom says that “no news is good news.” The discovery of even simple life on Mars would be devastating, because it would cut out a number of potential Great Filters behind us. And if we were to find fossilized complex life on Mars, Bostrom says “it would be by far the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover,” because it would mean The Great Filter is almost definitely ahead of us—ultimately dooming the species. Bostrom believes that when it comes to The Fermi Paradox, “the silence of the night sky is golden.”*

A few others that I would suggest if you don't already know about them. They're different films but they are essentially dialogue films + a certain moodiness

* Three Colors Red (French)

* Eric Rhomer Collection (French again) - Pauline at the Beach and The Green Ray are the highlights  for me here. Dated now but pretty wonderfully charming.

* Metropolitan and (not quite as good) the follow up Barcelona (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/whit_stillman/)

* Maybe *some* Woody Allen? Midnight in Paris and Vicki Christie Barcelona are two where it's not quite as quirky Allen as others. Hannah and Her Sisters is also a suprisingly wry look at the foibles of 80s New Yokers.

There's plenty of good reasons for people to link courses they like. God knows, there's a ""Just finished [x] on Codecademy, what next"" thread every 3 days where recommendations are pertinent.

Even content authors who *contribute to the discussion*, I don't mind if they want to say ""look I did this course, you may find it helpful"". I think we all are roughly aware of the fine line on self-promotion.

3168,"Hi

I was an expat living in London a few years ago. Got the ILR and after that (I think it's a 1 year period iirc?) got naturalised.

It's funny, I felt very similar to you. London wore me down quite a bit after a few years. Also a very big fan of Bali, not so much the long two flight treck from LHR via SIN.

Anyway, in terms of your questions, this was a few years ago that I looked into this. So I can't answer them off the top of my head. Note these points though:

* ILR is a very different thing from being naturalised. You want the latter if you want the benefits of EU citizenship. ILR only allows you permanent residence in the UK. If you want to live and work elsewhere in the EU, you need to become a UK citizen. When I did the process, it was an extra 1 year to get citizenship. Totally worth it.

* Yes, you do need to be mindful of the dates you're absent. I think you can be away up to 90 days.

* Note, to get citizenship you need to pass a citizenship test. This is a whole hurdle in itself, and iirc the 1 year time limit didn't start (or something) until you passed this test. Make sure you study for it and are ready to sit it on the first day you become eligible to do so. (This comment might not make sense now but come back to it once you've read the processes! Do not stuff this up or you are adding time to the total amount of time the whole thing will take you).

From memory, the UK govt websites (UK border agency when I did it) had excellent guidance on the times and processes. You need to go through it carefully and nail all the details.

Good luck, it's definitely worth it having come so far.",2015-08-30 21:17:26+00:00,cul4ny1,1.0,t3_3iyotu,20824.0,digitalnomad
3169,"IAAL and you are correct. 

The last sentence kills the whole enterprise. ""They're not intended to resemble or mimic actual persons"". **BUT THEY DO**.

That's the punchline. Unless those ""women"" are popping up on your screen with a label: ""Ashley's Angels"", then any ordinary person is going to expect they're interacting with a real person. 

There are a very great number of other indicators of fraud to bear in mind too. All of the advertising was suggestive of the possibility of having an affair. Now, if the population of the site was 5% Ashleys Angels, well ok. If it's 95%? Give me a break. That's clear misselling regardless of the fine print.

I'd say there's no right answer. Leaving the stream did give me an appreciation of having constants in your life, that people enjoy living a normal job. Being around for family and friends. Rituals you have with them, and the yearly rituals around certain holidays or other events. Anywhere you go, people follow these things. They do have value I concluded.

Of course, waking up in Paris at 7am and heading to a cafe to watch everyone else on their way to work has its own particular value too.

3236,"&gt; Actually, what this is going to do in the long run, is cause inflation. 

Good god this is a horrible attempt at economics.

Price increases will only cause inflation if there is constraint on supply. If there is excess capacity, supply will increase *at the same prices* to meet the additional demand.

And there's lots of excess capacity. But wait - not just in the US. Most of the household goods and clothing these people buy is imported, as well as a lot of the food too. It's imported from places like China that has more capacity than this wage increase will ever touch the sides of.

That's before you even get into the microeconomics of (1) not everyone is getting this wage increase, rather it's going to a small portion of the population, and an even tiner portion of aggregate national income (2) the dispersion of where these people are likely to spend their money (probably not Tim Hortons).

Second of all, your point fails on its own terms. You have shown that redistributing wealth of two individuals in the top 1% has a trivial impact. You have then made the impermissible jump from that to conclude that redistributing the wealth of the 1% is not worthwhile. This is a logical failure on your part.

For your argument to hold, you would need to do the math on the entire wealth held by the 1%. Given that that wealth is in order of 40% of the entire wealth of the country, ex hypothesi a redistribution of that wealth would not be trivial.

Follow your gut on going back end if you think that appeals. There seems to be a lot of demand for Node devs out there.

It's no wonder that haters as prominent as Tim Lane have read it and felt the need to come out swinging (hard) against the AFL. He's late to the party and only just caught on what we all knew since at least last August's court case, but the fact he has turned still says something about the force of what Chip has put together.

I truly feel for Hird. The sight of the entirety of Melbourne's old boys club coming together to stitch him up is something I find sickening, and it's an insight into this town's power elite that won't ever leave me.

It is remarkable in hindsight what an unbelievably decisive intervention #StandByHird really was. All the more incredible for having been done so early - in April 2013. It truly was the only thing that saved the guy from everyone in the AFL and for that matter the Club itself from pushing him out.

I get that Evans thought he was doing what he felt best for the Club at the time. I personally feel that if ""What is best for the Club"" was doing what he did to Hird, the Club is better off for his absence. He was brought to the Club to steer it through at the highest levels, he got every call diabolically wrong (I mean, his whole strategy of throwing people overboard to save the players lies in total and utter ruins) and the expediency with which he sold people out is something I never want this club associated with.

Granted, the current crop of short sighted property developers in this town would probably build shitty 30sqm apartments over them but it doesn't have to be that way.

This is completely incorrect. You didn't read the ""except such *as may be*"" part correctly. That doesn't mean all are excluded, it means some ""may be"". You need to point to where that was specifically dealt with. (IIRC, it was Southerners who owned 20 or more slaves).

The ""disenfranchisement"" didn't prevent the South electing Democratic representatives who eventually took control of both Houses of Congress less than a decade after the war finish.

The case for Southern grievance is pretty extraordinary given not one single Southern military or political leader was charged with treason, and they were returned to self-rule within a decade after they defeated the cause of Reconstruction.
