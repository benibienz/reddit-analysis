This happened last night, well this morning, around 1am on Fitzroy Street in St Kilda, starting around the intersection at the George Hotel.

I live on this street and ducked out to the 24 hour shops near the corner to get a drink and some chocolates before coming back to watch a film I had lined up. It was kinda typical for this time on a Saturday night, plenty of people around generally but definitely winding down and pretty quiet in patches.

So I'm coming back from the shop and cross the Canterbury Rd intersection, heading north back up Fitzroy Street in the direction of St Kilda Road. There's a women in her 20s, dressed up, not drunk but a little unsteady on her feet, walking in the same direction. Loud loud heels. She's on her own. We're walking in the same direction and I overtake her.

There's a sex shop on the right hand side just past the George, and as I walk past, she's a couple of steps behind me, two guys are in the doorway. Late 20s, early 30s. They both see her and make there way over to her. They start walking with her real close, matching her pace, and try to start up a conversation. One of them mentions how loud her shoes are. She's kinda responding but trying to shut the convo down. I'm getting a bad feeling already just by the fact that they're so obviously walking in step with her now it's like they're not going to leave her alone. So I kinda decide at this stage I'm going to stay with her wherever this ends up going. I slow down and I'm a foot or so ahead of her / them but a couple of feet off to the side. I try to shoot her a concerned look on the side but I'm not sure if she gets that I'm not with them - this is the first time she's noticed me.

They keep trying to talk to her, ask her where she's going. This is now about 40 or 50 meters on now, we walk past the Adina (sp?) serviced apartments, and one of them says does she want to come up? She says no thanks. So one of them peels off and walks into there, and the other one says he's going to walk the girl home. So at this stage now I'm definitely concerned. The three of us keep walking up Fitzroy St, towards Princes St now. He's still very close to her, pestering her with more questions. She says something like she doesn't know the area, she's not sure where she's going, but she's looking for a place on St Kilda Road where she just moved. He says he'll walk her there. She tries to say she's fine but he's insistent. If you know this area you'll know that after Princess St it gets pretty quiet at the top end of Fitzroy Street, and it's definitely dark and quiet around St Kilda Road at the top. And now I'm thinking this is definitely bad and trying to think what I can do. I'm a shorter guy, he's 6 foot plus and solidly built so I'm thinking trying to confront the guy directly could end up pretty bad. It's kind of a worry how quickly we're making it up Fitrzoy Street. Like there are still people around but we're flying past them and I just don't know how to get someone's attention or help. I think she may have felt similarly.

We get to Princess Street and are waiting at the intersection. They're off on the left side of the light pole, I stand to the other side of it. I bend around the pole a bit to make eye contact with her, that he can't see. I mouth silently ""ARE YOU O.K?"" She doesn't get it the first time so I repeat it and she looks directly at me and shakes her head, no. I give her a nod to confirm I understand.

He's still pestering her and we start crossing the street. At this stage she brilliantly gets the idea to come over to me and ask if I know the area, she's looking for [gives me the address]. I say I live just by there and so I'll walk her there to show her the way. (My apartment is 200 metres behind us in the other direction by now ...). Now she makes a very good move, and turns to the other guy and says ""This guy [me] lives just by there so I'll walk with him"". Thank god, the other guy says ""oh ok"" and turns around and leaves. We keep walking silently until he's safely away, and then we turn back in the direction she really needs to be going and I ask if she wants me to walk with her a bit more and she said she did. She said she had been very scared that something bad was close to happening. I walk with her until she gets on to the street she lives in and we say goodbye and she thanks me.

This really frightened me. Just how quick it happened and how few opportunities there were for her to throw this guy off before she potentially got into a very, very isolated position alone with him on a deserted St Kilda Road junction.

I have been thinking all morning how you get out of a situation like that. It's harder in real time than you might think. My takeaways are: Don't hail a cab and get in. [*Edit: someone below said this is bad advice, you should get a cab if you can. On second thoughts I think they're right*] This was initially what I was hoping she'd do last night in the first stages of her being harrassed. But I think a guy like that, there's a real risk he'd get in the car with her. If the driver starts taking instructions from him and not her it could be really bad. The best option I think was to walk into a pub or a bar, or anywhere, especially if it has restrooms. At least you have a chance to get on your own there and telephone someone.

The main thing I feel though is so much anger towards this guy. He is just a flat out menace, if not possibly an actual rapist. Just the fucking worst. At not stage was this woman ever signalling that she wanted his company, she was just trying to get home. What kind of person just invades someone's space like that and insists on walking with them totally uninvited, to their house, at 1am? And his mate, who knew what was going on, who just peeled off at their hotel and let him continue with it.

I've never known or seen men actually do something like this before. It's unbelievable that these men have families and friends and colleagues and and out there.",melbourne,Stumbled into a possible Jill Meagher situation last night.

They must have realized this had become a joke, and they made a big announcement that their course were from now on going to be priced in the $20-30 range, with no (few?) courses above $50.

What happened then was people got offered courses with sensible prices. I bought a bunch for $30-50 *which was the same I was paying before anyway using their coupons*.

Now, literally in the last week, they've jacked their prices back into the stratosphere. Any of the well reviewed mobile and web dev courses are back around $125 or $150 USD (I am seeing AUD$200+ local prices, so am approximating USD).

A *single* iOS course on there is going for AUD200 / USD130ish. 

You can buy an *entire year* subscription to skillshare.com (an all you can eat smorgasboard that is pretty good and getting better) for like $96. Or 5-6 months of all you can eat at Lynda for the same price.

The courses Udemy are offering are good, but they're not *that* good. To clarify: none of these courses are ""one and done"". I don't care if you build 15 apps, or 30 apps, none of them are at a standard where you have all the instruction you need (yes and I am including the obvious work you need then to go off and do yourself).

Here's an example:

    [Inside the viewcontroller.swift]

    someFunction() {

    self.answerButtonArray.removeAll(keepCapacity: false) 

    let indexOfCurrentQuestion: Int? = self.questions.indexOf(currentQuestion!)

    // Check if it found the current index
    if let actualCurrentIndex = indexOfCurrentQuestion {

These are examples placed inside a custom function definition. What I don't get is why self is needed to refer to some properties (answerButtonArray) but not others (indexOfCurrentQuestion).

Is it that you only need ""self"" to refer to properties defined in outside scope?

It's frustrating in that in all these things the instructors tell you ""add this, add that"" and I haven't the fainest idea what they mean. (Ok, UITableView makes sense, but the variety of different methods is overwhelming).

I feel like I'm learning the violin with a teacher saying ""play this note, then play this note, then this note"" but never learning to actually read music.

Two questions:

1. I assume the pareto principle applies here (20% of the methods are 80% of the use) - do you just go along until it all clicks?

2. Are there any useful summaries that explain in a systematic way what these methods are and how they work, that I could read in tandem?",learnprogramming,[iOS] Feeling lost in the pile up of built in methods,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4hu9rz/ios_feeling_lost_in_the_pile_up_of_built_in/

There's a lot of sites that use world or country maps in which you have extremely irregular shapes that are clickable. Say you have an area representing Greenland. The click maps that area pretty precisely, and takes you through to some Greenland connected pages or data.

How are these maps created? I can't actually figure out what the alternatives are but 
- styling the entire map as a bunch of extremely irregular divs,  each clickable - but the styling of an entire map to achieve this seems far too much work
- collating the entire map as a series of connected &lt;imgs&gt;, again each of those clickable. Same objection - seems like a CSS nightmare to bring all of those irregular shapes into alignment.

I assume the answer lies in the map being a single &lt;img&gt;, being the only practicable css implementation. But how do you overlay such irregularly shaped clickable areas?

It's a name that comes up here quite a lot, as a course recommended for beginners. Specifically, it teaches front-end and back-end web development, wholly in the flavor of javascript. 

It has consistently (and very noticeably to me, as I lurk here most days) received a lot of praise in the comments threads on here, to almost any ""Should I try FCC"" type threads. In fact, the comments threads have been so *uniformly* positive that it aroused my suspicions that it was potentially astroturfing. That wasn't a grudge against FCC. It was really a product of innate spidey-sense that the internet develops in many of us, plus a more personalized scepticism: There's so many courses out there, how could this one be so good? And specifically, could it really claim to be a ""one stop shop"" for an aspiring learner?

This scepticism was heightened recently when FCC started an ad campaign (on Reddit) saying no one finishes their course because they all get hired before they finish!

Well, having decided that I have some unfinished business with my own (toehold intermediate) javascript learning, I decided to have a look. 

(*) This review covers the first ""25 hours"" of FCC. That *excludes* the 50 hours allocated to (the first) two (of many subsequent) personal projects - building two (extremely) basic websites. I've done enough of that, so I skipped over that bit and followed the curriculum. The 25 hours is the estimated course time allocated by FCC to that part of the curriculum, and includes:

* A little bit on onboarding

* An introduction to HTML and CSS (5 hours)

* Introduction to Bootstrap (if you haven't heard of it, chalk it up as more CSS really) (5 hours)

* jQuery (3 hours)

* Basic javascript; and OOP and functional javascript (10 hours; 2 hours)

(For any total newbies reading this, these are the elemental building blocks of making things visible on the web, and is the foundation to a career as a front-end web developer or tinkerer as well.)

Proof of completion of these units: http://imgur.com/AvRYzFb 

**Background** I have been teaching myself code for about a 15 months, but with a very long break of about 10 months in between when I had to turn to a consulting project in my other occupation. I did no learning or practice at all in that period, so all told it's about 5-6 months of leaning, in my own time.

For the purpose of benchmarking, I'll set out roughly what my learning curve looked like:

* A couple of months with Treehouse and Codeschool

* Read a few books (the two books by Jon Duckett, and some other books on Javascript)

* After that (and in conjunction with continuing reading), built a bunch of projects based on some $10 coupon courses I bought off Udemy, and sourced on YouTube (very good source if you are prepared to sift through a lot of dross)

* Probably around the same time as this, headed over to Codecademy to fill in some gaps on my jQuery and JS OOP especially - did the whole thing and flew through the bits I thought I knew

* Continuous - bits and pieces as I need them in Bootstrap and specialist CSS topics etc, sourced from all over the place - eg Linda.com, more YouTube, more Udemy

* Did a bit of Udacity on Git and learned the command line somewhere along the way.

* Build a bunch of websites off my own initiative along the way, almost continuously - many of them simple, even silly experiments really (can I get an array to pop up like this on a screen) - these have been very important

Anyway, I'm not here to show off my progress or do a victory lap as I haven't got a job yet, so all this is really to set out what I approached FCC with. I believe I'm fairly well acquainted with what's out there, both if you spend some cash and for free.

**Review**

**FCC is a very fine program and I would recommend it unhesitatingly to anyone as either a starting point, or anyone who is looking to consolidate their initial education in front-end webdev gained anywhere else. However, it should be pointed out (and it does not qualify the previous recommendation) that -- based on what I have seen -- I very much doubt that it is a one-stop-shop to getting hired. But stop chasing that unicorn anyway. It's fantastic and your should do it.**

I flew through the course reasonably quickly as you'd expect, on and off over a handful of days in the last week. The time estimate of 50 hours for the material I mentioned above is about right if you're a total noob taking on these concepts for the first time.

This section of the course gives you some very early satisfaction in seeing you put some results up on the web. You'll gain (just barely) enough information to have a genuine web page up on the internet with some basic styling. 

These initial units in HTML and CSS (and Bootstrap) are nothing more than the basics however. The same goes for the jQuery module. You're taught just the bare minimum to scrape something together to put up on a web page. The instruction however is incredibly shallow, and the concern I have is where anyone gets real skill in CSS sufficient to know really anything about what they're doing. I don't recall, for instance, anything about the concept of floats being discussed. I think someone relying solely on this instruction would lack a basic vocabulary sufficient to be able to imagine what CSS is really about. 

The same could be said of the Bootstrap and jQuery material. There is no doubt this leaves you with a ton to learn. While that is true of any course of instruction, this material really does only just scratch the surface. While Codecademy's jQuery course gets you into toggle menus, dropdowns and carousels, you won't find those possibilities even hinted at in this material. It's all 
    $(.class).css(""color"", ""red"")

I have two takeaways here. One paradoxically is: it is great that they introduce Bootstrap and jQuery so very early in the program. In my experience, I spent more time in a state of anxiety about these big features approaching on the horizon, than in took actually to learn the basis of them. It really is great to give you a taste of these up front and get that anxiety out of the way.

On the other hand, I did not notice any further material in the course at all on those topics (save for jQuery events and AJAX a little bit later). *On the CSS side especially, the course leaves you with a huge amount to learn on your own steam.* Of course, some of this may well be picked up in the personal projects you need to make as you progress, but you are going to have to acquire that knowledge on your own, and you may lack even the basic frame of reference as to what the possibilities are.

On the javascript side however I think the course is superb. I haven't seen dedicated material on events handling -- this seems to be left entirely to jQuery. So again, a bit of a blackspot there, but that's an easy enough one to fill in. 

But what is here in the javascript sections is really, really solid. There appears to have been a huge investment of focus in programming details that many others skip over or miss out - you do a lot of array methods for instance, and then you apply these in some really interesting and quite challenging algorithm tests, like this one:

    // my solution code for ""Factorilize the number 5

    function factorialize(num) {
    var factor = 1;
    var numOfFactors = num / 1;
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= numOfFactors; i++ ) {
      factor *= i;
      console.log(factor);
      }
    return factor;
    }

This is a really fantastic little program to be writing at only ~50 hours of instruction in! And the course drills dozens, even hundreds of these tests. This was the actual attraction to me for doing FCC at this stage, being to fill in some of these gaps in programming analytically like this. 

These little projects may seem quite abstract, but when it comes time to make your own programs, and you're looking blankly at an array thinking ""how do I get these things to appear this certain way in this order on the screen"", it is stuff like these challenges that will really sort you out.

**Conclusion** I highly recommend it. FCC is not a one-stop-shop and I have to say I don't think there's a one-stop-shop in existence. I don't think there can be. (Here, for example, is a *NINE HOUR* course just on CSS page layouts: https://www.lynda.com/Web-Interactive-CSS-training/CSS-Page-Layouts/86003-2.html.). 
No one course simply ""has it all"".

If you're a beginner and you're asking ""I'm interested in web development, should I try FCC"", my answer is unequivocally: Yes.

However, if you're asking ""Should I do FCC or Codecademy or [otherCourse]"" my answer is, do them both.

Didn't think my enquiry was strictly suited to cscareerquestions as I'm self-teaching.

I've been learning front-end for a while and need to go into templating land to progress. There appears to be overwhelming demand for Angular (on the front end) and Node (on the back) in the jobs market.

I started learning with the objective of making my own stuff, but at some point I would also like to consider getting a job in the sector.

For making my own stuff Meteor.js is incredibly attractive for the ability to put together a back-end fairly seemlessly. It also has a fairly simple templating language (based on Handlebars.js) and the ability to switch that to React.js.

The jobs market for professional Meteor developers seems somewhat dire though. In fairness, it's only just recently had its 1.0 release, so I guess it will take time to attract adoption. But there are a few concerns about its scalability, again that might change in future (they currently don't support SQL).

Could I seek some advice on whether Meteor is a sensible option if I ever want to get a job? And also, whether experience in Meteor + React.js opens up the React front-end jobs world?

TIA

My mother recommended this to me, I didn't think I'd enjoy the subject matter (not having any interest in high school football - or so I thought), but boy what a great set of stories and what a wonderful cast.

Anyway I just have to get a few things off my chest if anyone is around!

* Jason Street is driving me mad. What a shitty boyfriend. I'm in the episode where Lila has just driven 200 miles to visit him at the rugby tryouts in Austin. His reaction is ""Oh, what a surprise"". (Lila's driven in a highly emotional state as her parents are having a huge fight). 
Jason's behaviour towards her is really poor (and I am talking after the Tim Riggins stuff has burnt off).
Jeez he's just really really difficult to like. 

* The match up between Smash and his love interest Waverley doesn't work IMO. I just can't see him going for someone who is a bit of a nerd and, well, not all that hot. I mean, there's no chemistry on there and it doesn't work on screen either.

* Julie is my favourite character - brains, sweet, and being in the middle of the coach's family and dating the QB puts her in the middle of great plot lines. Really enjoy any scene she is in at the moment.

* Actually, need to amend the above - Coach is my favourite character. Am sure that's a safe choice. Great guy. I love the way he works through all the crap floating around.

* Don't know about Matt Sarasson. Likeable guy but ... I don't know if there's any character in there. He's in the middle of a lot of stuff, and you can tell he's a sweet guy with a good head on his shoulders but ... is there any more material in his character to develop? I like the scene's he's in but I don't know where his substance is ...

* Matt's sidekick is a crack up. Great actor.

Anyway I'm just loving this series and it would be good to hear any other views.

I guess the B2B web won't change dramatically that quickly, so there will still be lots of business SPAs around, but in terms of the consumer market, will there be a massive shift of time on the web (and mobile apps etc) to VR?

&gt;Magic Leap, a secretive company making wearable technology for mixing digital imagery with the real world, is seeking to raise $1.14 billion. Jaunt, maker of a 3D camera for filming virtual reality video, has nabbed a total of $138 million, including $90 million in September. And 8i, which makes technology that lets people interact with video of humans as though they were in the same room, has raised nearly $21 million.

&gt; None of these start-ups is a household name. Few members of the public have had an opportunity to interact with — much less buy — the virtual and augmented reality technology that these companies are developing.

&gt; Yet investors and entrepreneurs believe that headsets made to immerse people in digital worlds are the next giant moneymakers in technology, setting off an investor frenzy rarely seen since the early days of the web and mobile markets. Virtual reality start-ups are multiplying, venture capital is pouring into them and the believers are expressing blue-sky thinking about how the new products could reshape entertainment, communications and work.

I've been learning about 5-6 months on and off, and there's some issues I know that I have about participating in a group like this, and maybe others will feel the same.

The issues are mainly confidence sharing the issues I face, wondering if they're too basic for people who are up the curve, but also too advanced for people just starting out.

I'm talking about things like getting in to OOP beyond just the ""Here's an address book"" illustration found on Codecademy or a million other tutes. Like, actually deploying OOP on practical problems. To make the example more concrete, there's some nifty [examples of code on github I'd like help walking through](https://github.com/saadq/Anagrams), and piecing together, but I feel selfish asking for help just as one person on that one exercise.

He is going through some inline event handling to illustrate some things. In this example, he is swapping a ""before.jpg"" image with an ""after.jpg"" image onMouseover.

He has created a function to do this, and I can't understand how the function call is identifying / grabbing / finding the first argument.

I have highlighted the argument / parameter where I can't follow the chain:

This is the html being operated on, with the function call:

    &lt;img src=""before.jpg"" **id=""before""** onMouseover = ""swapPic(**id**, 'after.jpg');""&gt;

And the function:

    function swapPic(**eId**, newPic) {
      document.getElementById(eId).src = newPic;
    }

**So the function has a param, ""eId"", and it receives the argument ""id"" from the function call. But how does ""id"" in the function call supply the function with what the id actually is (which is id='before')**.

Is this a mistake, or is onMouseover supplying the content to what the ""id"" argument is?

All of the OOP is extremely simplistic, like creating an address book, or a list of products.

Whenever I see OOP in production code however I get extremely lost trying to follow it. More importantly, I have no idea how to turn the basics into something useable, eg, even refactoring simple procedural code for tic-tac-toe, or similar.

Any resources (preferably books but video etc ok) that brings you up the curve on using OOP in a more sophisticated way would be very helpful.

The basic set up is:

    var d = new Date();
    var h = d.getHours();
    // equivalent variables for m and s

All of h, m and s log to console accurately.

The problem is when I try to concatenate h + m + s and output these to the screen as text strings.

This code concatenates them, but displays the output as a sum, not a string concat:

    var output = h + m + s;
    var el = document.getElementById('display');
    el.textContent = ""#"" + output;

Result screenshot: http://imgur.com/z6XtDeb

If I change the code however, I can get it to not sum h+m+s, but instead concatenate them. This works:

    // delete [var output = h + m + s]
    // instead, ""hard code"" the output into the textContent
    var el = document.getElementById('display');
    el.textContent = ""#"" + h + m + s;

Result is correct: http://imgur.com/FmB0xt8

I'm happy that I've debugged it, but not happy that I don't understand why it works, and what was wrong with:

     var output = h + m + s;

Grateful for any clarity.
