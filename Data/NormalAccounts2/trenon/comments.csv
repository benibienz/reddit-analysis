21,"I am a landlord.

1. Talk to your landlord and tell them whats going on. No landlord wants someone in their building that doesn't want to be there. Damage deposits are peanuts compared to the damage a tenant can do. Taking a tenant to court costs money and although the landlord might get some back they will never have all their time and costs covered. 

2. The landlord is responsible for showing the property...BUT...you are liable for the lease until someone else rents it. Make it look good so someone want to rent it, and someone will probably rent it. You did so theres a good chance someone else will as well. 

3. Walk away option. Talk to you landlord and make them an offer. Tell them you'll clean the unit after you go but they can keep the damage deposit or something like that...regardless if they rent the unit or not. Most will agree to this because if they rent it out they get double rent for a month. GET IT IN WRITING. Worth noting that they will be motivated to agree to this as they have the potential to make more, and you get off the hook regardless of if they rent it out or not. 

4. Last but not least. You are liable for the loss the landlord has to take to re-rent the unit. Advertising, and if he has to drop the rent to get someone else in there he could fight for you to pay the difference in rent. (He will win on this) So even with 2. you could still have to pay money. With 3. you just walk away from your damage deposit (on good terms with the landlord, don't just walk away. If he sues it will go badly for you) and are free. 

5. Keep records of all your interactions with your landlord. If all the above fails. Start a tenant dispute the the tenancy act. Take screen shots of the add for more monthly rent. Do this while you are in good standing (ie still paying rent). If you can clearly show your landlord is being unreasonable (sounds like they are), and you are in good standing they can (and normally will) nullify a lease.

All tire science and tests prove you wrong. Show me a test with all seasons out performing winter tires in cold conditions. There aren't any. Winter tires do better than all seasons on dry and wet pavement below 7°C. 

Calgary has these lovely things called Chinooks you may be familiar with. Where everything melts and then refreezes. Have you been up  Sarcee? Out west on Bow Tr? Up 10th ST hill by sait? Home Road? These are all in the city and get littered ever year with people that ""don't need no winter tires"" and they just can't make it up the road, they don't get enough traction. Yet all of us with winter tires drive around them effortlessly wondering why they are stopped in the middle of the road. 

By you're own admission you alleged there is 4 weeks a year in Calgary where winter tires are beneficial. I take it you stop driving for those 4 weeks then since you do not use winter tires? Oh no right, you have a bottomless pit of misinformation...oh wait i meant driving talent.

We have milder winters here than most, but we still get winter. Unless you are going to stop driving when its bad outside you should get winter tires. A good driver wants anything that will make the drive safer. By your own admission theres 4 weeks a year that is true for winter tires. (It's actually much longer than that). 

You make the argument about cost. It does cost more to have winter tires as well. There's no way around that. But its not as bad as people think. Since you are now running 2 sets of tires they wear at half the speed. So really you are out the cost of switching your tires twice a year, and a second set or rims. Hell if you're a commercial driver you can write all that stuff off anyways.

Lastly yielding the bolt is not always a bad thing. It's a necessary for some designs. Might want to go back to the fundamentals of machine design.

46,"Like I said, unless you use a cheater bar / hammer / jump on the bar you're not going to over torque it. Use the tool as it was intended and you'll be fine. I highly doubt you can curl 140lbs with one arm. 

As I said if you have a torque wrench, great, use it but trying to say that the average joe doesn't have the right tools for the job is fear mongering to try and get them to come to a mechanic. If you want to get all technical every fastener in the car will have a torque specification. You should be using a torque wrench on ever single one, but its pretty rare to do so. Automotive design has quite a large safety margin, it has too, as the cars can be serviced anywhere by anyone. We could make them a fair bit lighter if the car specs only allowed it to be serviced by a mechanic that was specifically trained in that one car, but we can't. 

You've cast doubt on my qualifications. My Dad is a mechanic who's worked on 3 continents and in the military over a 50 year career. I grew up working on cars with him. I went a different route and became a mechanical engineer. I specialized in stress analysis and failure mechanics. I have built my own street legal car for fun, have owned a variety of race cars (rally, track) and motorcycles and done all the work on them myself. I've now got into welding and machining my own parts. 

So to put this in perspective the mechanic is guy that looks in the book to see 80 ft-lbs but has no idea why. I'm the guy that tells you use 80ft-lbs and has a closet full of design data, destructive test results to base it off of. 

You're right that if you yield the bolt you can work harden it, which isn't always a bad thing. Technically yielding the bolt makes it stronger. The problem with that is that it hardens it as well which lowers its cracking threshold which lowers its fatigue design life.  Anything with threads has a bad fatigue resistance to begin with as you've created the best place for a crack to start by design. Hardening it makes it even more susceptible to cracking which does not help. But like my original comment said, if you use the wrench provided with the car, and don't stand on the thing you'll be fine. 

Garage based torque wrenches are not usually calibrated, they are commonly out a fair bit, out a ton if stored improperly. Then you get into the accuracy of using torque to tension a bolt. The accuracy on that is horrible. If you actually want to get 80 ft-lb of equivalent tension you'd need to use a bolt tensioner that is really expensive, and quite large. The cost to change your tired would go up by an order of magnitude. Which is why it isn't done.

People have been changing tires without torque wrenches for a long time. You are correct the textbook way to install one is with a torque wrench. I have one so I use it, but I have installed many a tires...ON RACE CARS... without out them with no problems. Tire shops are typically using highschool kids / apprentices to do basic (ie change a tire) maintenance that every single person who drives a car should be able to do. 

If you don't have seperate rims then going to a shop makes sense. If you do....your car comes with all the tools required to change your own tires, and if you drive you should know how to change a tire.

You have ZERO chance of that lien holding up in court inside the city limits. Also if you build it on their property they can sue you for encroaching on their land and you will be liable for legal costs. They can even make you pay their taxes for the portion of their property you have now occupied (if they let you keep the fence).

Lastly that is mainly meant for farms and as such the ""reasonable"" cost of fence will be the cheapest possible barrier. It does not have anything to do with the fence you decide to build. The second part of that is proving they gain a benefit from it. Unless they have livestock, a child or a dog you SOL. 

You will spend far more in legal fees trying to enforce that act than you will get from your neighbor. According to my lawyer it is extremely rare for a judge to rule in favor of enforcing it in the city limits. My lawyer had seen it upheld in acreages but never in the actual city.

127,"Mine was last weekend. 

I had family in town so my brew buddy was supposed to head to the local brew store when it opened at 10am to get out grains so we could be done before supper. Aparently there was some miscommunication there and he took that as leave his house at 11:30am to go get them.... Brew day delayed until 12:30. 

We finally get started. Clean everything up so its ready to go. I look at the recipie my brew buddy chose for the first time. It's a lager that has like 7 types of hops in it...Why? So now were brewing an expensive lager (not my first choice). He had just got Beersmith the night before and totaly botched entering the recipie so all the volumes were off. I had to go inside redo everything and scale it properly so it would work. 

We mash the grain in a converted 10 gallon igloo. I had forgot that I had an appointment scheduled at 3pm that day. Luckily it was for something in the garage. During the 30 min appointment it was time for my brew buddy to sparge. Stuck mash. I have never had a stuck mash ever (brewed ~20 AG batches at this point). We brew 12 gallon batches so I had to remove all the grain make sure the valves, false bottom, and hoses were clear and dump it all back in. 

We get the mash to move very slowly but whatever the day is progressing. 

Boil time. I made a hop spider out of a 3x4 PVC reducer and some threaded rod. We've used it a number of times and it works great. This time I decided to lave my pump recirculating during the boil to get more out of the 7 different types of hops we were adding. Some of the re-circulation hit the PVC reducer and it was enough to soften it and the hop bag fell into the boil....FACK. I spend the next 20 min recirculating the boil through a strainer to try and capture all the pulp of the pellets. We add more hops as we really have no idea how much of the original hops are going to get utilized. 

Fast forward 20 min and the PVC reducer starts actually melting. It was about 1/4"" away from falling into the boil when I noticed it. Throw it in the garbage and just hang the nylon sac from the side of the pot. 

The only good thing about this day was I had previously picked up an inline filter to keep crud out of my plate exchanger. We'd had issues in the past cleaning the thing so this was meant to keep out anything large enough to get stuck.  (It worked)

It's now supper time so I have to man the BBQ while my brew buddy keeps going. He sterilizes the primaries (we use 7 gal kegs) and the exchanger, hoses etc. I keep 3 gallons of star san in a jog to use for such occasions. 

Turns out the keg he grabbed was one I had soaking with oxyclean in it. He assumed it was star san so he mixed two together. I didn't find out until later on when he was trying to put the entire mixture into my 5 gallon container and it didn't all fit. 

This means nothing was sterilized, and both the start san and oxyclean were neutralized. Oh and that keg was probably full of garbage in the bottom as well as I had just got it. So we have an expensive lager that will most likely turn to shit. 

It was a long brutal day that will most likely result in shit beer.",2016-05-05 21:52:16+00:00,d2udfz3,1.0,t3_4hzm3l,34786.0,Homebrewing

132,"Fatigue can be tricky as the bolts are threaded so there is a perfect start to a crack. Failure mechanics usually are usually more of a issue than the fatigue loading that you would complete doing a FEA analysis. 

Strain hardening can hold up well in fatigue if it is designed for it. In some cases better than non yielded see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque-to-yield_fastener

Typically in bolting the mean stress is high but the alternating load (ie fatigue) is not. Which makes fatigue a small issue. 

A quick google will provide you with a number of books talking about the subject.

134,"You know that the stresses you are seeing at the bolts are totally invalid right? That's a gross structural discontinuity, the smaller you make your mesh size the higher the stress will go. 

Before you start trying to fix a problem you should quickly check to see if your model is valid. To do that you need to see if your results are dependent on mesh size. Run the model to get initial results, double your mesh density and see if they change. 

I would also question why you are running an FEA on such a simple geometry. If there are hand calcs out there for it use them first. FEA is just a tool, its really easy to make a pretty picture that doesn't mean anything.

I'm all into this vise for about 300$ CDN (like 5$ USD) and its now straight and parallel within half a thou. Pretty happy with the results. I had him grind every piece, jaws, base, blocks and all. The only down side is I didn't have him chamfer anything so the edges are damn near razor blades now.
