To do this I'm using a 1/2"" thick piece of aluminum. There are a few bolts that cannot extend through the aluminum plate. I'm looking for some sort of press in fitting / nut kind of like a rivet nut but a bit more aggressive on the outside. I have currently threaded the aluminium but it is not confidence inspiring when there is ~400HP held by 4 M12 bolts. 

I do not know the name of what I am looking for. The bolt is M12x1.5 if that matters. Any advice /  places I could buy such a thing?",Machinists,Press in nut?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Machinists/comments/5ccz5f/press_in_nut/

After looking at the costs of various options I decided to go with PaulCNC (Paulcnc.com)

After you get over the poor website you can look at what he has done with the kit he sells and I was fairly impressed. The RF-31 was never going to be a super high tolerance machine for me so a low costs CNC option that may not be the most rigid was ideal. 

I hooked everything up and after a few technical glitches with parallel ports and a set of mixed up wires everything was up and running. 

The base kit he sells consists of 3 stepper motors, some drivers a breakout board and power supply. I was a bit weary of how the motors mount with a simple hose clamp but it seems to be rigid enough for the cuts I do. I have been using Mach3 with backlash compensation. The CNC cuts have been holding as good of a tolerance as I can get by hand or better. ( I don't have a DRO)

I just finished getting it up and running today so I don't have anything exciting to show but here's a video of it in action. I was just going to cut a 1"" hole but somehow I had entered 3.25"" which doesn't work well in 1.5"" square tube.

I've purchased an old vertical mill, tore it apart, cleaned everything and lubed it up. I started to make some chips and everything seemed good until I started measuring. 

I had checked the table when I purchased the mill and new it was about 1.5 thousandths out across the entire length of the table. That I expected. But what I did not expect was my brand new 6"" vise to be out 5 thousandths over 6"". It's a cheep Chinese vice as is all my tooling but it should be pretty much flat shouldn't it? Should I return it? What would be an acceptable amount for it to be out?
