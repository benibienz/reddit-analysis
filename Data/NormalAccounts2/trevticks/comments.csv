4,"Can you become a second shooter for a wedding photographer?  I have been a second shooter / assistant photographer for a few weddings and I learned a lot. I would recommend that before you buy gear, you should get as much experience as possible.  Everyone has their opinions on lenses and bodies, see what works best for you.   My favorites for weddings are the 70-200mm 2.8   and the 85mm 1.4.  I shoot with a D600 and a D800E but I doubt the bodies or the lenses really matter that much.  I saw a beautiful wedding album from a photographer that shot an entire wedding with 2 old Minolta XD11 35mm film cameras.  

Best of luck and please feel free to PM me anytime.  I'm no expert though.

If you can, go to a range where you can shoot a bunch of different models to get a feel for what you like. You might want to try something chambered in .380 if the 9mm has too much recoil, I wouldn't recommend a .22 for defense mainly because rimfire cartridges are not as reliable as centerfire cartridges.  

If you plan to leave your weapon in a car be sure to install something more secure than your glove box. There are specially made boxes and safes for this purpose.

If you find yourself waiting for a customer, do something about it. Get on the phone.  Go to the service manager, see if they can get you a list of regular service customers with high mileage vehicles.  Call them and ask about their service experience, mention current offers, etc explain that you would be happy to set some time aside to show them the new model or a clean pre owned model.  Set the appointment!  Before they arrive have the vehicle gassed up, clean and ready to demo.   

As your sales manager if there are any dead deals, call them all and have a conversation about why the deal died.  Maybe circumstances have changed. 

If your dealership has a service drive, get there early and help people check in or move their shit.  Give them your card, thank them for the business...etc.  You will get leads.  Build a relationship with the service writers, they are great for leads.  Sometimes the shop estimate is more than the car is worth and the customer will want to explore the option of a newer vehicle.  

Whatever you do, don't sit and wait for business to come to you, don't be one of the guys waiting for customers to show up.   Set a lot of appointments, talk to everyone, be aggressive.  When your appointments show, ask them all to buy.  Do great walkarounds, spend time getting the customer engaged with the car, pull it out of the line, open all the doors and shit. Ask everyone to buy.

166,"I am not an expert in those areas but the team of people who answer the web form submissions are true experts with decades of experience and education. I will try to give my opinion on some of the topics though.  My personal areas of expertise are related to lift truck applications.

- Best Practices for Order Picking - HUGE topic.  To me, a lot of these practices will vary by application.  For example a single shift 10,000 sqft. warehouse will be run very differently than a 1,500,000 sqft. 3 shift distribution center. Using a hands-free pick to light or pick to voice system might be great for the larger DC but the costs would outweigh the benefits at a smaller, slower warehouse.  There are certain practices that seem to hold true for all applications though.  For example, keeping faster moving SKUs low and closer to the entry point of an aisle.  Lately I've seen a shift towards more automation, specifically with conveyor systems. Anything that can reduce travel time is key. As a general rule, picking should be done horizontally at the ground level. etc  I really should find a resource that lists best practices.  When I get a good one I'll post a link.  Is there a specific area that concerns you the most?

- Solar. I think solar panel installations can make sense in terms of reducing the organizations environmental impact as well as reducing operating costs. I would like to see an ROI calculation before I open my wallet though. A couple of my customers have added solar to reduce costs and it seems to be working. I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to make a definitive determination.  On another note, I'm excited to see how LED lighting will benefit warehouse operations. 

- Warehouse Supplier to Gigafactory 1 - I would be throwing out a wild guess at this question.  I am quite sure that it will have a great deal of automation, very efficient component delivery systems, AGVs, vertical carousel machines etc.  The size and scope of that particular project will be massive. There are teams of people who have made this kind of thing their life's work.  I am always blown away when I see a CAD drawing of a large warehouse.  The thought and science that goes into it is magical to me. 

- Worst Warehouse Setup.  I have seen some things that I wish I could forget. One of the worst warehouses that I've been in was an automotive parts supplier.  The aisles were very short and laid out 90 degrees opposite of how they should have been, also the ends of the aisles were closed on one side so the forklift operator had to go up and down an aisle instead of being able to continue around.  This made for very long runs between picks.   The pallets were heavier than the racking was rated for and the racking wasn't even anchored properly.  Small parts of different SKUs were kept in the same bins.  The lifts were not maintained well and the batteries were rarely watered. It was a mess. Another place I visited was a very old building and only had 3 docks.  The lack of docks created a huge bottleneck for shipping and receiving. I could go on.  I am amazed that some organizations will work so hard to gain a 5% increase in sales but won't spend any effort to look for double digit increases in efficiency.  

I doubt that I have been much help but thank you for the interest.
