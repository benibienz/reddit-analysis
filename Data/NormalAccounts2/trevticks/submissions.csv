What are some of the best ways to sell it off that are low risk and relatively time efficient? Where is a good place to learn about values?

There are about 30 camera bodies, everything ranging from Leica, Canon, Nikon, Hasselblad, Contax, Yashica, Zensa, Zeiss, Voigtlander etc. Tons of lenses, Voigtlander, Zeiss, Nikkor...  Lighting gear, flashes...

Edit:  Damn, you guys and gals are amazing. Thank you! 

I will try to create a list and take some pics as soon as I can.

Thank you all in advance, I appreciate any information. ",photography,How should I sell a camera collection? Is there a better way than eBay and Craigslist?,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/54oxuu/how_should_i_sell_a_camera_collection_is_there_a/
