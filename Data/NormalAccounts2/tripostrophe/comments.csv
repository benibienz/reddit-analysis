14,"Hi u/shitzafit,

I'm sorry to hear that you've had to endure that kind of treatment from folks because of your accent -- as the child of first generation immigrants to the US, I can somewhat empathize with that.

I would like to make sure you've had a chance to read our [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/wiki/about.compact) and taken a bit of time to get a feel for what folks have already put out there in terms of talking about racism and class, especially from a rural/poor white perspective. [This](http://thefeministbreeder.com/explaining-white-privilege-broke-white-person/) is a great start.

That said, I have a friend who also grew up in the Appalachian region, and they've let me know about some really cool orgs doing anti-racism work in poor and rural white communities. 
[Southerners on New Ground](http://southernersonnewground.org/about/) is a great example of an org that does work across racial lines and specifically with poor/rural populations that you might want to look into if you identify strongly as an Appalachian person.

One of our other mods also found the [Appalachian Community Fund](http://www.appalachiancommunityfund.org/our-grantees/), which supports some orgs doing similarly great work (though none of us have really vetted it as an org personally).

20,"The focus on Castile's race was missing the forest for the trees on both sides, and the far more important parts of the document are the works by Afropessimist theorists like Dr. Frank B Wilderson III and Dr. Jared Sexton, who calls for non-Black POC to move beyond attempts to create facile equivalencies among non-White groups in America (the Asian American civil rights struggle is just like that of African Americans!) when the major driving force informing US racism continues to be, and has always been, anti-Blackness. Sexton argues for example that ""It [was] racial blackness as a necessary condition for enslavement that matters most, rather than whiteness as a sufficient condition for freedom.""

I think Indigenous and refugee POVs offer important perspectives that must be brought into dialogue with Afropessimism when talking about socially dead populations, but have found few other arguments against giving anti-Blackness primacy in this current moment (""Black Lives Matter"") to be very convincing.

With regard to police violence, most of the well-written pieces on Gurley/Liang will be advocating for equal accountability under the law and arguing against the [raciological](https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/693) reaction that arose in support of Liang, which required that APIs adopt a white supremacist worldview that devalued Black life in order to redeem an exceptional and ""fundamentally good"" member of the limited community we've imagined for ourselves -- same as those who've defended the abusive shitbag George Zimmerman or convicted rapists like Brock Turner.

69,"Latinx is a relatively new term that didn't start seeing heavy use outside the community until the last year or so and Jared Sexton is admittedly a bit up there, but this subreddit is not TiA and you bet that anyone critiquing the work of another community of color without doing some incredibly basic research is going to be called on it...especially when they conflate Women of Color feminism with white feminism.

These terms can be academic and inaccessible, sure, but nowadays no college educated person has an excuse, and even people who don't have access to college can get some really great, accessible information from sites like everyday feminism, colorlines, and code switch.",2015-11-21 17:22:26+00:00,cx83zsk,4.0,t1_cx82sg0,2225.0,asianamerican
70,"&gt;""Hey White people, I'm a 'good' Asian American liberal who's not like all those dirty FOBs and their stupid backwards racist ways! I know how to use your terminology like 'trigger warnings,' 'Latinx,' 'intersectionality,' etc.""

1) The author makes no mention of generational differences.
2) Latinx is a gender-neutral term coined by genderqueer people of color who identify as members of the community you might know as Latina/o, Chicana/o, Hispanic.
3) [Intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) is a term coined and popularized by Black and Latina feminists including Kimberle Crenshaw, Patricia Hill Collins, and Gloria Anzaldua. Intersectional feminists are generally not going to be very invested in White American liberalism and its normative assimilationist politics (like 'leaning in').

&gt;In these proclamations of pro-minority support (a proclamation I admire), we shouldn't ever try to step on fellow Asians to make ourselves look good. Perhaps a step towards that would be to examine how and why anti-Blackness arises among Asian Americans.

Any discussion of this must also include Jared Sexton's [critique](http://antiblacknessisatheory.tumblr.com/post/104685487040/ourtropes-jared-sexton) of the term 'People of Color.' All these articles about anti-Blackness among AAPIs are informed by his article.

79,"Indeed, because when I think of fascism in American higher education, it is not the 'un-hiring' of a professor for tweeting statements critical of the Israeli state that comes to mind; nor is it the recent proliferation of white nationalist student groups on campuses across the US; or the incident this week where a white supremacist made death threats against Black students on the Mizzou campus and the university remained open because apparently Black lives *don't* matter (or maybe the DOJ recently relegated hate speech combined with death threats to a subcategory under trolling and internet griefing). No, it's definitely footage of angry minorities **yelling** at a distinguished professor that makes me concerned for the future of higher education.

For all the outrage about sheltered minority SJWs that *Friedersdorf, FIRE &amp; co. have been publishing, it seems that the events of the past two weeks have done more to expose white fragility and how powerful an unexamined modernist mantra like 'free speech' can become for people so invested in an epistemology of ignorance that they lack the moral conviction to grapple with the disparate access that various groups within the US and institutions of higher education have had over the years to express themselves without fear of receiving death threats, being subject to government surveillance, or even assassination in the case of some 1960s radicals.

&gt;Still, I am not ready to consider celibacy my only option to a liberated, decolonized love.""

as a rejection of such a dichotomy between white men and celibacy as the only options available to her that leaves open the door to other possibilities.

Much of what she writes throughout the article is ambiguous, perhaps intentionally so. I think she's having trouble defining a 'liberated, decolonized love' because all her romantic experiences up to this point have been within the realm of a heteronormative and white supremacist society. The entire article is a reflection on how pervasive larger social forces of white supremacy have been throughout her life, down to shaping not just what is desirable but what is even thought possible in the realm of romance, sexuality, and relationships with others.

When she critiques the conceit of individualism on page three, it's just as much a critique of 'preference' and the illusion of free will amongst colonized people/POC as it is of white fragility.

I think this is an excellent article because it's an honest examination that highlights the conflict between the desire to believe that we're autonomous (and good, morally consistent) individuals on one hand and on the other, the understanding that society shapes us in ways that burrow down to the core of how we understand ourselves and thus act in our daily lives. 

Rather than a performance-for-others of trying to prescribe a model of 'correct' behavior like Asian American MRAs love to do, it's a deep reflection that gives me hope for the possibility of her coming to understand and then move forward with/beyond the harmful social constructs that have shaped her. I wish I could say the same for so many men who are going through the motions of ""liberating"" themselves for other ~~white~~ Asian men. It's a deeper critique that paints a fuller picture than reductive Christian/positivist conversion narratives of ""I was an ignorant sinner, now I see, and am saved, kicked the habit, full stop.""",2015-07-30 19:22:36+00:00,ctlw3j1,4.0,t1_ctltrgl,3252.0,asianamerican

147,"If you're just starting out, definitely take advantage of everything that's out there and allow yourself to dabble around a bit, expand your horizons! I entered undergrad leaning towards the humanities, then quickly got pulled towards a department with more of an activist bent in the social sciences. It was great, I learned a lot, but do wish I'd allowed myself the freedom to delve a bit deeper into other fields.

I do work in another field now that folks would probably consider social justice-y, but over time have also found that I enjoy working with data and spreadsheets (very basic excel stuff). Finding a particularly elegant solution to a problem at work is pretty satisfying, and I wonder what it's like for folks who work with data and technology all the time, rather than the sometimes tortured politics of working with irrational human beings who might say no to something because it involves someone they hate, or strays too far from established patterns.

W/r/t sociopaths, I've just observed a tendency for cults of personality to develop around particularly charismatic individuals in activist circles, even when they might not have a particularly strong grounding in the theory they espouse (people talking neoliberalism this, intersectional feminism that). And there's always an endless stream of bright-eyed young activists for established community leaders to manipulate and take advantage of. But not all orgs are like that, just have to do your due diligence to make sure you're not jumping into a revolving door that chews up and spits out young professionals, or one that has terrible internal politics like the racist transphobic mess that is the Human Rights Campaign. Chatting with former employees usually helps.

At nonprofits I've done work with basic office functions, database administration, recruiting volunteers, voter registration, organizing events at local community centers... Colleagues would be designing websites and graphics, fundraising, working with coalition partners on public health projects, etc. Really depends on the job and the needs of the organization.

&gt;They threaten the White patriarchy by shows of Black masculinity and BM/WW relationships.

You do realize that this is the same line of reasoning that led to [Emmett Till's murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till)? It's an offensively reductive view of Blackness that reads every act as resistive or reactionary and leaves no room for action or thought beyond the narrow confines of 'fight[ing] the power,' or life outside of the paradigms imposed upon us by whiteness. You can't read resistance into every relationship between a Black male and a white woman just because of the identities they hold.*

Interracial relationships involving whites and POC may threaten white patriarchy in the popular imagination, but they do nothing to destabilize it. They simply expand the boundaries of acceptable sexual contact between whites and others. They may change attitudes within individual family units or communities, but in no way do they address systems of white supremacy and patriarchy, which have always been maintained through patterns of exclusion and expedient inclusions.

Miscegenation between Black male slaves and free white women did not change the lived reality of chattel slavery, nor disrupt rape and sexual violence committed by white slaveowners against Black female slaves. White GIs and rice queens have always been willing to slum around the third world or Ktown for foreign ass, and even white women are [getting in on it now](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2014/10/17/female-sex-tourists-in-the-caribbean/). Interracial intimacies and racial violence have always existed comfortably beside one another, so don't try and tell me that another Mandingo or Keni Styles is going to be what sets us free.

You want to disrupt white patriarchy? Show the world what intimacy and sex can look like without the will to control or own, without Asian men trying to police other's sexuality or perform hypermasculinity in order to prove themselves worthy of the white man's place at the top of the food chain. Fuck monogamy, fuck heteropatriarchal norms that only value someone's ability to reproduce an exclusive nuclear family. Think bigger.

&gt;""Part of what hinders our capacity to see [vulnerability and interiority] in their gestures is a general concept of blackness that privileges public expressiveness and resistance.

In fact the idea that black culture is both expressive and resistant is now so common that it neither seems insightful nor requires justification. Of course, central to this thinking is the assumption that all expressiveness is necessarily public. This essay, then, explores the uses and limits of black publicness as well as what a concept of  quiet could mean to how we think about black culture.""",2015-06-21 06:16:07+00:00,csdllnr,2.0,t1_csd7vmo,32328.0,asianamerican

157,"To borrow from Wendy Cheng's notion of a 'Spanish fantasy past' in the Southwestern US, I think there's a considerable difference between a person with direct family ties to an identity and a white person seeking Native American ancestry through sketchy genetic tests or fabrication in order to lay claim to land, dividends, or local history.

I don't think whether a person 'comes across' as Asian is a good indicator, either. I have a childhood friend who's Korean and white but passes for white most of the time unless people know to look for it; I remember when her mother first brought her to church, we were playing games and the kids were mistreating her and talking shit in Korean without knowing that she was completely fluent and had grown up with strong Korean influences in her life. And I don't think growing up Asian is a fair yardstick either for folks like adoptees or people whose parents were strong on promoting assimiliation.

To address your later comment, Cherokee Nation doesn't use blood quantum -- instead, they require that citizens have at least one ancestor who was on the [Dawes Final Rolls](http://www.cherokee.org/Services/TribalCitizenship/Citizenship.aspx) but there were also Cherokees who refused to be a part of that system, in the same way that Japanese Americans had No-No Boys in the internment camps.

159,"Although the conversation around passing is an important one that mixed race folks have been engaging in for a while, I'm leery of folks trying to police the legitimacy of other's claims to ancestry based on lived experience or blood quantum when there is indeed a direct family tie.

Plenty of Asian Americans -- mixed and transracially adopted folks from older generations in particular -- grew up without exposure to large parts of the lived Asian American experience because of the pressure to assimilate. We've seen this pressure play out in the [African American](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/10/07/354310370/a-chosen-exile-black-people-passing-in-white-america) community, as well as in assimilation-oriented Federal Indian policy prior to the passage of the [Indian Child Welfare Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Indian_Child_Welfare_Act). While stories like those of Hobb's cousin are pretty repugnant, at the same time they totally make sense in the context of a racist society where Blackness is tied to social death and whiteness is rewarded.

I think it's important to allow folks of all backgrounds to explore their identity and relation to the greater AAPI community without trying to impose prescriptivist rules that exclude others. At the end of the day, race is just another tool of the state that compels us to view ourselves in certain ways, and act accordingly to the point where even the ways in which we resist are largely predetermined.

Too often we allow race to become this fixed, permanent category that's either true or false of a person, and that just becomes limiting; we need to treat race as a fluid, contextual identity that is flexible enough for us to expand it when necessary to bigger visions that go beyond our in-group to more inclusive definitions that allow for the possibility of solidarity with other people of color, working class white folks, people in the third world, etc. Else we just end up performing a revised version of the same song and dance that white culture has asked us to perform ever since the melting pot metaphor came into vogue.",2015-06-17 23:11:07+00:00,csa43ne,1.0,t3_3a72hp,14704.0,asianamerican
