5'5"" here and looking for a brand of bike shorts that has smaller (shorter) padding areas. Typical weekend rides are 10-25+ miles with lots of climbing, also starting to bike as my primary mode of transportation to/from work (short, less than five miles). Usually wear men's but also fine with women's.

I tried on a pair of pearl izumi bike shorts in small at my local REI, but the padding area was sticking out beyond my tailbone a bit. Other brands seemed to be a bit worse. Was I wearing them wrong, is it normal to have a bit of extra length, or are there brands of shorts that tend to run smaller that I should check out? I'd prefer shorts over underwear so I can quickly change out of them at work. Any advice appreciated.",cycling,best brands of bike shorts for small people?,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/49dmnf/best_brands_of_bike_shorts_for_small_people/
