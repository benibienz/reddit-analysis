3,"As someone who doesn't enjoy UCI and its atmosphere, I actually think you should go with your gut and not come here. It may get better over time, but college is an expensive endeavor. It sounds like you would be happier living at home and going to community college for a year or two, then you can switch over to another school. 

You don't have to jump in to the deep end if you aren't ready. If you do decide to come here, have an open mind and don't try to change everything at once. Shower during an off peak hour so you have some privacy. Try to make your room comfortable. Take things slow. The quarter system zooms by fast so you need to take time out of your day to look at the bigger picture and relax.",2016-09-15 19:45:01+00:00,d7o90yi,1.0,t3_52xfsk,6538.0,UCI

15,"Irvine als Stadt hat viele Vor-und Nachteile. Die Stadt und sogar der Campus sind sicher, ordentlich, und ruhig. Es gibt viele Trails für Radfahren und Wandern, um ein bisschen Natur zu genießen. Die Stadt wurde im 60er Jahren zentral ausgeplant mit Wert auf das ""suburban"" Lebensstil gelegt d.h. braucht man hier sein eigenes Auto um die ganze Region zu sehen - nur 15 Minuten zum Strand. Ich sollte auch sagen, dass Irvine im Orange County liegt, einer der reichesten Teilen der USA, und natürlich man sieht das in der Miete und Preisen. Nachts ist es hier ausgestorben, aber wann man die ganze Zeit zu lernen verbraucht, ist kein Ding. Wenn du mehr Nachtleben und Kultur haben möchtest, dann schlage ich dir UCLA vor... diese Uni hat auch einen besseren Ruf und ist ziemlich mehr hier in die USA bekannt.

16,"Not sure if you still need this advice, but here is my take:

Irvine for a young professional to work is fine, but depending on your needs, I would look some place else to live. Irvine is an apex suburb and very expensive It'll be around $1800 for a decent one-bedroom plus utilities, security deposit, furniture etc. It is a very expensive city full of so-called luxury apartments and single family homes. 

I would look into Costa Mesa, 405/55/73 triangle, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana South Coast Metro which are in the immediate vicinity. You can also do Lake Forest depending if the job is in the southern part of Irvine. 

I wouldn't look too far out as you want to avoid a killer SoCal commute. You can get a room with 2-3 roommates in a house for around $800. Those towns mentioned above offer a lot more to do as Irvine is pretty quiet with no nightlife or normal downtown.

19,Strange because I am only ever near the Social Ecology buildings for classes and I never smell smoke. Only once have I seen someone smoking. Maybe it has to do with my schedule or time of day.

30,I lost a lot of weight when I lived in Germany. I ate bread everyday and plenty of beer. I was also a student and would go on vigorous walks and bike rides and take the subway to get around. The walking plus the non gmo wheat and smaller portions all worked in tandem. Fast food was hard to come by. It was mostly bakeries with fresh sandwiches and meals. It is impossible to replicate this lifestyle living in an auto centric suburb and with sitting most of the day at work. Europeans who have exposure to American habits seem to gain the most weight heh heh.,2015-11-11 01:54:12+00:00,cww1ksf,1.0,t3_3scox6,1483.0,keto
