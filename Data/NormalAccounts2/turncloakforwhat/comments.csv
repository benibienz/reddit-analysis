My current rescue  dog, who I have reason to assume was abused, certainly does have frequent nightmares where he moans and yips and cries, while my spoiled pug with no history of abuse who we raised from a puppy rarely physically acts out her dreams and never seems distressed like my abused dog.
Obviously, correlation does not equal causation, but it's interesting. I do wonder, though, if maybe some breeds dream differently? That could be a cause.

61,"Yeah, I know it ""wouldn't have made sense"" to have Jeyne, but...what was the point of showing Theon getting tortured in excruciating detail and then glossing over all his important moments in the show? it feels very exploitative to me. I feel like D&amp;D believe that everyone's world revolves around the Starks, and we just want to see the Starks succeed and other characters just learn that you should never cross a Stark because they are perfect gems of human beings (don't get me started on how much I hate Jon Snow at the moment, ugh). 

But, I am really looking forward, so much, to seeing where Theon goes from all of that in TWOW. There are so many options, and I know it will be amazing to read.

As for the ""drink,"" scene, I hated that so much. I miss my kind, tough but emphatic Asha-- Yara is not my favorite person at the moment (I also really didn't like her reaction when he came back to Pyke). 

&gt;and him trembling for, what, 2-3 seasons now?

lol, I think the writers really don't understand him. They see him as a beaten dog so they write him as a beaten dog, and that's just not really Theon at all. Even in Dance, he has his sassy moments, and in the sample chapter, he's all over the place, but I feel like he's not just cringing and looking shaken:)

The Kingsmoot-- I was so, so excited for it... See, they really just don't care about the Ironborn. They think they're stupid so they don't even take the time to do justice to their coolest scene (imo).

72,"I've spent ten years living in Asia, so I was sort of exposed to the extremes of dressing up your dogs. I knew people who dressed their dogs in full outfits and shoes and perfume everyday, and traveled with suit-cases just for their dogs. I've been in multiple dog boutiques filled with extremely expensive ""designer"" dog clothes-- and that was just in a small town. Over there, people pierce their dog's ears and have no qualms about dying their dogs bright colors. 

I always felt bad for those dogs. They never seemed comfortable-- they were often neurotic. Obviously, this was probably less a result of being dressed and more a result of not being treated like animals but it always left a bad taste in my mouth.

I would never dress my dog for decorative purposes. I do have a sweater for him because the winters where I live now can be harsh, but it's very plain and intended for warmth not decoration.

I don't necessarily think dressing dogs is ""evil"" but I certainly think it's a little ridiculous and sad for the dogs when it's taken too far.

186,"I spent several years volunteering at a shelter, and although it wasn't a kill shelter, animals I had bonded with and cared about died often due to health issues, old age, injuries, and occasionally uncontrollable behavioral issues which caused them to be put down. It was always hard. The pain never went away. But it did help to have the perspective that maybe you and the other volunteers had made their life a little happier and more comfortable than it would have been otherwise. Often, too, because I worked in a rural area, the dogs that died were able to die in a stable, comforting environment rather than starving to death or succumbing to mange.

Mourn the dogs you make a connection with. It's a natural  response. I'm sure some people will suggest not trying to bond or connect with the dogs, but if you're like me, that may be impossible. 
We can't save every animal, but what matters is you are making meaningful contributions to their health and comfort while they're here, and that's what matters. ",2016-08-20 19:33:12+00:00,d6ppiz6,1.0,t3_4yqn52,1015.0,dogs

I got the dog at the end of the semester and spent lots of time with him. He's a great dog. That said, it's a big commitment. You have to sacrifice time from your studies and your socializing. You have to be secure financially and have a supportive social network. I think it can definitely work if you're committed, but if you have difficulty being reliable and committed in other parts of your life, a dog might not be for you. For a lot of people, being free to do whatever whenever is a big part of college. That's great, but a dog makes that difficult. For me, I'd rather have a dog.
All that being said, I know too many horror stories about students getting dogs and then abandoning them when they get overwhelmed, or break up, or finish school and have to move.
Don't get a dog unless you can absolutely commit to it now and in the future.

There are dogs (and cats and other animals) that will literally die, after living miserable existences if no one takes them as a pet. I feel like it is the kinder thing to do, to save a life and make it as happy as I can, than to think a dog would rather die alone and before its time than be a pet. Moreover, all my dogs have always wanted to be with me. My last dog never had a leash (we lived in a very rural area), and has always followed me around of her own volition, the door is open all the time and she never goes out-- neither does our rabbit who lives in the house. We have a bond, an established trust, and, I think a love for each other.

I think I also made use of some timelines and flashcards I found online but I can't remember the particulars. I have to say, I relied pretty heavily on the Crash Course book once I finished the textbook. Just use good study techniques, which you probably already have if you got a 5 on AP world, and you should be fine. Also, remember to do practice essays! You do a lot of those in a traditional class and it's important to practice them a lot, especially the DBQs in my opinion.  I wish you the best of luck!

629,"I think Theon's information of the Ironborn is definitely more than a bit glorified, and out of touch. First, as you say, he was nine when he left. That's the age where maybe he was just starting to learn history, and mostly he was probably just super impressed with ""the grownups."" Then, he gets fed these legends/histories about the Ironborn in the North, who as you say probably embellish  a little, unintentionally or not. Either way, it seems like Theon latches onto this history, because it is the only real way he can connect with his culture.  He learns all about their glorious past, but he has surprisingly little information on what's going on currently. So, as you say, he comes back, not only with a false sense of what is going on, but also with a false idea of who he should try to be. Theon is wants to be the stereotypical legendary Ironborn, which is a great idea except that, a) he has no idea how to go about it and 2) that time has sort of passed. He comes back to Pyke expecting these fearsome people, the people he heard about, and there's a disconnect when his father is a bumbling, bitter old man...I think Theon came back expecting heroes, expecting to be a hero, and was shocked when the Iron Islands were simply not the places of legend that he was expecting.

645,"&gt;driver’s test,

change to drivers test. The apostrophe is wrong. 

&gt;The sweat dripping down my face, the goosebumps of fear rising up on my arms, and feeling my stomach clench at the thought of my tester’s scrutinizing gaze.

This is a powerful sentence, but it is a fragment. Perhaps begin, ""I will always remember....""

&gt;Driving of one sorts or another had always been a pleasure to me.

Driving of one **sort** or another

&gt;It was not until I was around 12 years old that I realized just how much I loved driving, on that day, my father let me steer on his lap while driving around the parking lot.

It was not until I was **twelve** years old, when my father let me steer on his lap while driving around the parking lot, that I realized how much I loved driving.  (You could  also try to find another word than driving to diversify your language)

&gt;It was from that day forth, that I knew that I loved driving.

Remove comma

&gt;As I start driving, a million thoughts rushed through my mind **trying to remember every detail** that my driving school had taught me because I knew that I could not bear to see my tester**’**s reactions if I **happen** to make a wrong move.

Errors bolded

&gt;After maneuverability and driving around for a bit, the **DMV** worker and I headed back to the **DMV**.

&gt;Love at First Swipe

I like your title! 

&gt;Those functions 

I would suggest changing that to ""these functions.""

&gt;**brain**. Those functions are the simplicity of Tinder’s layout combined with the visual response of the **brain**.

Try not to repeat words so much.


&gt;What Tinder does to make it so popular is actually very simple;

This sentence needs work. It's a very passive sentence. Try to make it more active. 

&gt;What Tinder does to make it so popular is actually very simple; the app is designed in such a way that the focus is put on the **person** and their looks, and maybe a few words to guide someone into matching with the **person** they see on their screen. As straightforward and simple as it appears to be, Tinder has an **intended target audience**, and ends up being a replicator of how that** intended target audience** interacts with one another. 

Run on sentences and repeated words weaken your thesis and bore your reader. 

&gt;Tinder reaches its **target audience** perfectly because it is inherently a parody and miniaturization of the collective social behavior of the people who use it

You used target audience again! Find another word.

Overall, I would recommend rephrasing things to have a more active voice. I would also work on shortening your sentences and using more diverse language choices. Hope this helps!

788,"Glad I could be helpful! By the way, Asha/Yara's jailbreak attempt wasn't in the books at all, so I can't speak with as much authority on his mindset there as I can about other events. That said, I would say he was less ""biding his time,"" and more trying to avoid pain. He's in this situation where he's been brainwashed into seeing the world like  Ramsay is this god who can defeat anyone and knows everything, so escape seems futile. In the scene, he also seems to think that Asha is some kind of trap laid by Ramsay to test his loyalty, and given the fact that he is in a delusional state in which Ramsay seems like this all powerful force, it makes a certain amount of sense. 

Your comparison to Gollum is not far-fetched. GRRM has actually said that Theon is his tribute to Tolkien's Gollum. That said, there are several major differences between the two characters, which I would be happy to go into if you are interested. 

I'm a little confused about your question about Jeyne, but I take it you're referencing the scenes from Ramsay's wedding night in the books. There is no clear-cut mention in which Theon says anything along the lines of that he can't perform. In one of the most sickening scenes in the series in my opinion, Ramsay tells Theon to get Jeyne ready for him. Theon says  ""I have no--"" which mean several things, such as I have no right or I have no working parts, but it's never finished, so we don't have any solid proof one way or another. If you read the link I posted in a comment above, it covers the entire question of whether Theon is still intact pretty well. As I said before, I am of the opinion that he is intact in the books.

794,"It wasn't as big a deal in the books, although Bran and Rickon played a large part in Theon's feelings of overwhelming guilt, coupled with his betrayal of Robb. Actually, in the books, so far, Theon hasn't actually told anyone he hasn't killed the Stark boys, so there is no big reveal there like in the show. He does mention to himself internally, however, several times that he didn't kill the Stark boys. Later in the books, Bran communicates to him through a weirwood tree and plays a pivotal part in Theon becoming Theon again. I was really disappointed that wasn't in the show. Anyway, that's about all there is on Theon and Bran and Rickon.

Regarding his castration, in the show, Ramsay sends several people the skin from Theon's fingers but he never sends Theon's penis to the Iron Islands. There is no direct confirmation that Theon has been castrated, and until I see more solid proof, I am of the mind that Theon was not castrated in the books. If you're interested, this link (http://emiliosandoz.tumblr.com/post/91408667498/why-book-theon-still-has-his-dick-and-what-it) covers the topic very thoroughly. It's a good read if you're interested.   So, to answer your question, as far as we know there is a decent chance he is intact. 

Edit: I do want to clarify that the Boltons know in the books that Theon killed Bran and Rickon just like in the show. He just doesn't tell anyone else like Sansa's book equivalent, Jeyne Poole",2015-07-09 14:13:38+00:00,csxemnf,3.0,t1_csxeasu,592.0,gameofthrones

806,"Theon is a really complex character, and as a book-reader and a huge fan of his, I have found that his whole mental situation is pretty difficult to understand when watching the TV show, due to the fact that Theon is pretty dynamic and you aren't inside his head all the time, seeing the world through his eyes and understanding how he thinks. Did Ramsay ever break Theon? Yes. It wasn't as quickly as in the show, and it wasn't particularly in relation to castration (which we actually have no proof of in the books). We actually don't have a lot of details on what exactly Ramsay did other than torture him, cut fingers and toes off, bash in teeth, starve him, and play a lot of mind games. Somewhere in there, Theon was forced into adopting the persona of Reek by Ramsay, and it ended up being a bit of a coping device. The thing is, and this really annoys me, because it's not obvious in the show, *Theon never truly believes he is Reek.* He just forces himself to believe he believes he's Reek. (Yes, it's inceptiony, I know) I've read some ridiculous articles which claim he had a complete mental break and some sort of amnesia in which he actually became a different person. This is entirely untrue. If you read the books, it is very clear that Theon is very, very, very frightened and is trying hard to maintain the Reek persona because it is a way of coping with this terrible thing that has happened to him and it pleases Ramsay and thus doesn't get him hurt. The thing is, no matter how hard he tries, ""Theon""'s memories and thoughts shine through a lot and as the book progresses, Theon stops trying so hard to be Reek (inwardly at least), and he gets himself back. So, yes, he was truly broken, but no, he was never actually ""gone."" His personality was always there, he was just pushing it deep, deep down. As for Moat Cailin, he had absolutely no choice. He knew if did anything other than the agenda, Ramsay would just capture him and torture him again. Even if maybe that technically wasn't true, that was his perspective. In the show, his sudden snap from Reek to saving Sansa doesn't make much sense, but in the books, there is a slow progression throughout Theon's chapters as Theon struggles with regaining his self-identity and overcoming his guilt and fear to become a better person. They are some really amazing chapters and I suggest you check them out sometime. Anyway, that's about all I can think of to say right now, but if you have any questions, let me know. I'm sort of an amateur Theon Greyjoy expert and I enjoy talking about him. ",2015-07-09 12:21:10+00:00,csxbhph,1.0,t3_3cmphh,34836.0,gameofthrones

808,"Theon Greyjoy is Azor Ahai reborn. I know it sound silly, but I firmly believe it to be true.  The prophecy reads,""When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."" Okay, so first of all, in one of his earliest chapters, Theon looks at the red comet and says something like ""this comet is for me."" Not very much evidence, since everyone in the books molds the comet into meaning whatever they want, but it got me thinking. So, anyway, there we've got the red star bleeding. In the prophecy, it says that Azor Ahai will be born again amidst *smoke* and *salt.* Theon was born in both--both in his baptism in Pyke (salt) and in the burning of Winterfell (smoke) (Theon even has a line where he says something like Reek was born in the dungeons of the Dreadfort). So, you have two re-births there. Bran also has a vision of a ""snake,"" which many think to be a dragon (who knows) in the North, right after the ruin of Winterfell. I know it's stretching it, but that could link some connection to dragons and Theon. Alright!
