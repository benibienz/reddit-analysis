He'll never be a dog who greets everyone and wants to be their friend-- if anyone but me is in the house, he will hide under the bed.

It turns out, everyone thinks this an incredibly strange name, so I've ended up telling people his name is Huck or Nacho (his nickname). I thought about changing his name, but he comes to it now, and I personally like it, so that's that haha.

My rescue dog who came to me unable to walk on a leash recently started walking on a leash. I'd like to say I taught him, but really one day he just decided to do it. I think it was pretty intuitive to him when it finally clicked because at home, he follows me everywhere so he just decided to follow me outside too. The problem now is that he lags really far behind me. Never once does he want to walk beside me or ahead of me.
When I pull the leash tighter, he just stops walking.
Any advice to get my dog to walk beside or ahead of me on the leash?

I don't know his exact background, but he was severely abused when I got him-- missing an eye, ribs and legs had been broken. He is very skittish and scared. I've been working on gaining his trust and house training, but I'm at a loss at how to teach him other basic things.

1) First, he really needs to learn how to walk on a leash, but he's terrified of leashes. I think he was beaten with one. He becomes extremely terrified when I put a leash on him-- freezes up, eyes bulge, hyperventilates. I've tried putting a leash on and giving him treats and speaking reassuringly, but no dice. Later, I left the leash on the floor for a while a couple times hoping he could get used to it, but he avoided it like a snake. I feel like he really needs to learn to wear a leash (walking can come later). Any tips?

2) Secondly, the poor dog does not know how to play-- no interest in toys, no inclination to be a happy dog and mess around. I'm worried he's depressed because he doesn't want to do anything but lie around. Any tips for teaching a dog to play? Good beginner toys? I don't care about my having fun, I just want him to have some joy in his life and maybe get some mental stimulation and exercise. 

I'd really appreciate some help with this. He's so timid, and I don't know how to work on positive behaviors without ruining the trust I'm trying to establish with him.

I'm also a vegan (and before that a vegetarian), so doing right by animals is a big part of my life. I can definitely appreciate the benefits of getting a dog from a breeder (less health and behavioral complications), and I have no issue with people who do, but I feel like personally, the right thing for me to do is to adopt a shelter dog. I feel like it's more important to offer love and a home to a dog who might potentially never get it than to a dog who will be ensured to have it, growing up with a breeder who will make sure he gets a good home. Buying a dog from a pet store is not an option because I don't want to support puppy mills.  It's important to note that I don't think all people should or need or are in the position to rescue, and I think responsible breeders are great. I just think, personally, it's important to adopt.

I always joke that it's sad that Theon became a minor character in his own plot line, but today, I was reading an interview, and the director actually literally said that. So, yes, I guess it's confirmed that they felt S5 was more about Sansa (and dare I say Ramsay and friends) than Theon. This is really messed up, because that storyline was Theon's from the start, and he was robbed of anything meaningful in favor of Sansa. Seeing that they literally considered his development a subplot is not surprising, but it is a slap in the face to people who were hoping they would acknowledge Theon as a main character in that particular story line, as GRRM does. I wish Theon had just been dropped from the show, because he contributes little to the story in the way they are using him and they seem incapable of doing him the justice he deserves.

Hello, everyone! Welcome back to /r/Ironislands ’ Ironborn read-through.  In the upcoming weeks/months, we’ll be going through George R.R. Martin’s series, *A Song of Ice and Fire* with a concentration on events that happen on the Iron Islands. As we progress through this, hopefully, together, we can come to better understand and appreciate the Ironborn and their storylines. This is the second installment in the series. Be sure to check out [Readthrough #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronIslands/comments/3l15wb/ironborn_readthrough_1/), if you haven't already. 

**Summary:**We return to the Iron Islands in Theon's second chapter in ""A Clash of Kings."" Theon is admiring his new ship when he meets a woman named Esgred who claims to be the wife of a Sigrin, the shipwright. Esgred flirts with Theon, who is so taken with her that he ends up deciding to take her back to Pyke with him. As the two ride from Lordsport, Theon attempts to impress Esgred with his plans for the future. He is not entirely complimentary when talking about his family, or their culture. When they arrive at Pyke, much to Theon's surprise, Esgred turns out to be his sister, Asha. Asha humiliates Theon at a feast, later that night. After the feast, Theon is disappointed to learn that his father, who plans to take the North, has given him the least important role in the mission. 

Theon II is an amazing look at Ironborn culture. We get a rich view of some of the things that really set the Ironborn apart from the those on the mainland, and even better, we get to meet Asha, who is breath of fresh air after Aeron and Balon. The chapter is also helpful in continuing the progression of Theon's character arc. Theon's frustration at his inability to ever please his family grows and grows throughout the chapter. By the end, you can begin to understand why Theon feels like he needs to do something drastic in order to gain the respect of his people. 

**What we Learn About the Ironborn**


**Overall:**
We find out a lot of random interesting things about the Ironborn throughout the chapter.
 
The chapter begins by establishing that the Ironborn consecrate their new **ships** to the Drowned God. It is interesting to see how the culture and the religion of the Ironborn mesh. 

We also get insight into the Ironborn's opinions on **horses**: ""The Iron Islands were too sparse and rocky for breeding good horses. Most of the islanders were indifferent riders at best, more comfortable on the deck of a longship than in a saddle. Even the lords rode garrons or shaggy Harlaw ponies, and ox carts were more common than drays. The smallfolk too poor to own their own either one pulled their own plows through the thin, stony soil."" So, horses are not the norm. 

For those interested in the **weather**, Theon mentions that since he has been there, it has been- ""grey and overcast...with frequent rains.""

Finally, we are introduced to how the Ironborn elect their **kings**. 

*The ironborn would never seat a stranger in the Seastone Chair.""

(Later)

""I am their lawful prince,"" Theon said stiffly.

""By the laws of the green lands, you might be. But we make our own laws here, or have you forgotten?""

George R.R. Martin is gently steering us towards the concept of a kingsmoot.

Speaking of the **Seastone Chair**, we learn in this chapter that it is a throne, ""carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone. Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on the shore of Old Wyk when they first came to the Iron Islands. 

In my opinion, the Seastone Chair sounds like it would give the Iron Throne a run for it's money in terms of creativity!

Finally, we get to our last bit of general culture, which is always a little detail I have enjoyed-- the **finger dance**. 

""Three burly men were doing the finger dance, spinning short-hafted axes at each other. The trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step. It was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one...or two, or five.""

I love this part of the Ironborn festivities, because it is just a perfect example of Ironborn badassery for lack of a better word. Who isn't impressed by people who throw axes at each other for fun?

Moving on to characters we learn more about...

**Theon** Theon continues to realize that he is terribly out of his depth and to supplement for this by being a jerk and hoping somehow that will make people take him more seriously. 

**Asha**-- 
 ""Ironborn, he knew at a glance; lean and long-legged, with black hair cut short, wind-chafed skin, strong sure hands, a dirk at her belt. Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face, but her smile made up for it."" 

Asha really takes the center-stage in this chapter. Fearless, witty, and irreverent, it's difficult not to like the axe-throwing daughter of Balon Greyjoy, even as she epically destroys every attempt Theon makes to gain any standing with the Ironborn. Most importantly, Asha shows us another thing that makes the Iron Islands different from the mainland-- she is recognized for her prowess and competence and treated equally among men despite the fact that she is a woman. Especially considering how sexist most of Westeros is, this is a surprising development. 

**Alannys** We learn about Theon and Asha's mother, Alannys Harlaw in this chapter. ""She is off at Harlaw and not expected to return,"" Theon says of her. Asha adds, ""The cold winds have worn her away, I hear...Lady Greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son."" We never meet Alannys directly, but she has basically gone mad after the loss of most of her children. It's always struck me as sad that Theon never made it a priority to go see her. 

**Euron**-- We learn a little about Euron in this chapter. Asha as Esgred remarks, ""Euron Croweye has no lack of cunning, though. I've heard men say terrible of things of that one. ""
Theon replies, ""My uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close to two years. He may be dead."" Theon then thinks that if so, that would be best-- Euron had never given up the Old Way and his ship the *Silence* was feared from Ibben to Asshai. 

**Victarion**-- Most of what we learn about Victarion come's from Theon's uncomplimentary, biased opinion of him. That said, not much of what Theon says is entirely untrue. ""Victarion is like some great grey bullock, strong and tireless and dutiful, but not like to win any races. No doubt, he'll serve me loyally as he served my father. He has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal.""

**Misc:**

**Smiler**-- Finally, we can't go without mentioning, Theon's horse, Smiler-- ""a stallion with a temper as black as his hide."" Theon bought him from Lord Botley, despite the horse's attempt to bite of his face, and tamed the horse, something of which he is pretty pleased about. 

**Sea Bitch** Theon's ship. Named for Esgred. 


**Conclusion**
That brings our first read-through to a finish. What did you enjoy? What can I do work on for next time? Let me know!

**Discuss:** Did your opinion of Theon change in this chapter? Were you surprised by Asha's appearance? What do you think some of the biggest differences are between the Ironborn and the rest of the Westerosi?

 **Ironborn read-through #1:** Theon I, ""A Clash of Kings""


*“Windy, cold, and damp. A miserable, hard place, in truth…but my father once told me that hard places breed hard men and hard men rule the world.”*
-- Theon I, “A Clash of Kings”

Hello, everyone! Welcome to the start of /r/Ironislands’ Ironborn read-through. In the upcoming weeks/months, we’ll be going through George R.R. Martin’s series, *A Song of Ice and Fire* with a concentration on events that happen on the Iron Islands. As we progress through this, hopefully, together, we can come to better understand and appreciate the Ironborn and their storylines. So! What more are you waiting for? Grab your copy of  ""A Clash of Kings"" and let’s dive in.

We are introduced to the Iron Islands for the first time in ""A Clash of Kings"" as we return home to the islands with Theon Greyjoy, who has his first POV appearance in ""Clash."" In this chapter, Theon, the last living son of Balon Greyjoy and long-time ward of the Starks comes back is coming back to Pyke after nine years away. Although the prince expects a warm welcome, he is met rather coldly. His uncle, Aeron, a religious zealot meets him at the docks, at Lordsport. Aeron takes Theon back to Pyke where his father, Balon, does not greet him with affection—rather he delivers a series of harsh criticisms that range from questioning where Theon’s loyalties lie to critiquing his fashion sense. When Theon attempts to propose an alliance between the Greyjoys and Robb Stark—the entire reason for his coming, Balon immediately turns the offer down. He reveals that he has his own plans for capturing and ruling the North.

Theon I is a fascinating chapter, because it is really introducing us to several things at the same time: Theon, his family members, and the Iron Islands. We get a lot of information dumped on us for the first time in this chapter, which can be interesting, but also confusing. To make it easier, I’ve divided what we learn into two categories.

**What We Learn About Theon**

*“I must never go far from the sea again.”*

After all, this is a chapter from Theon’s POV, and we learn a lot about his character. This is Theon’s first chapter from his perspective and this is the first time we really get an introduction to him. We’ve seen him in the background of A Game of Thrones, kicking people’s heads and smiling a little too much, but we haven’t really had any substantive look at him, since most of A Game of Thrones’ POVs only think of him in passing (I think if we had a Robb POV, things would be far more Theon-centric). Anyway, George R.R. Martin makes sure Theon leaves pretty bad first impression. Theon is arrogant. Theon is a misogynist. In fact, forget the misogynist part, Theon is pretty much a jerk to everyone. Theon is immature and inexperienced. It doesn’t help that the other characters in the chapter treat Theon with little respect, so it’s easy to mock him. “Theon isn’t even a proper Ironborn,” readers smirk as Balon tears the gold chain off Theon’s chest. At least if you’re going to be the “bad guy,” have some charisma. Overall, the general impression you get of Theon is that he’s not a likeable fellow. “What an ass,” Jon Snow remarks of him in A Game of Thrones, and most readers would probably agree.

Theon is so easy to dislike, that it almost seems dull at first. We aren’t reading ASOIAF because we like stereotypes, after all. However, there’s a catch-- George R.R. Martin is the master of morally grey characters, and Theon is an example of his best work. We haven’t even gotten very far with Theon, and we’re already seeing a really interesting display of raw humanity. As you read through this chapter, look for the nuances in Theon’s character. Below all the arrogance, you’ll find insecurity. Below the smiles, you’ll find sadness. It’s that sadness and that insecurity that will drive Theon’s actions in later chapters. 

**What We Learn About the Ironborn**

*“We do not sow.”*

We learn a lot about the Ironborn in this chapter—touching on both the people at large, and their culture. We also get a chance to meet two representatives of the Ironborn—Aeron and Balon Greyjoy. These brothers play an important part in how we perceive the Ironborn as a whole.
Theon gives us our first look at the raiding lifestyle of the Ironborn when he tells the captain’s daughter about salt-wives and rock-wives. Immediately, we realize that things on the Iron Islands are not (or at least were not) like on the mainland.

In an aside, Theon elaborates on Ironborn culture—“Once I would have kept her as a salt-wife in truth…Once. When we still kept the Old Way, lived by the axe instead of the pick, taking what we would, be it wealth, women, or glory. In those days, the ironborn did not work mines; that was labor for captives brought back from hostings, and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep. War was an ironman’s proper trade. The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song.”

Theon continues to think about how things have changed. “Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren, gave Harren’s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen, and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm. Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands, even behind the high stone halls of Pyke. Theon’s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow.”

Theon (who is naturally recounting the extremely titillating back-history of the Ironborn while having sex at the same time), neatly wraps things up by quickly reminding us of Balon’s rebellion, his hostage status, and his aspirations for the future.
Aeron and Balon also both introduce a key part of the Ironborn culture—namely, the religion of the Drowned God, and the concept of paying the Iron Price.

**Aeron**— We meet Aeron, first. Theon barely recognizes his father’s brother because he has become a religious fanatic over the years that Theon was gone. Aeron reconsecrates Theon to the Drowned God, pouring salt water over his nephews head (“Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.”) For the first time we hear the words, “What is dead may never die.” This is a phrase that is not only central to the Ironborn religion but also important symbolically for Theon’s character later on.

**Balon**— When Theon finally sees his father, Balon Greyjoy, his father is not particularly happy to see him. In the midst of all the family drama, however, George R.R. Martin teaches us another important lesson about the Ironborn by introducing the concept of “Paying the Iron price.”

““That bauble around your neck—was it bought with gold or iron? Theon touched the gold chain. He had forgotten. It had been so long…In the Old Way, women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin, but a warrior wore only the jewellery he took off the corpses of his enemies slain by his own men. Paying the Iron Price, it was called. “

Paying the Iron Price is an ancient Ironborn tradition. As Theon noted before, it has lapsed along with the Old Way, so Balon is being pretty unfair by calling Theon out for it. That said, again, paying the iron price is a concept that will come up again and again in the Ironborn storyline. It is representative of an entire way of life—a way of life that Theon will try to reconcile with his Northern upbringing to disastrous results. It is extremely impressive how George R.R. Martin can subtly give the reader an entire backstory on a people, in a short amount of time, all so naturally that we do not even realize he is feeding us the information.

**Conclusion**

That brings our first read-through to a finish. What did you enjoy? What can I do work on for next time? Let me know!

**Discuss:**

Do you enjoy Theon’s POV? What were your first impressions of his character? Did they change as you read the chapter?
We see the Iron Islands for the first time in Theon I? What is your first impression? How do you feel your impression is influenced by the bias of the POV?
Things are different than Theon remembers. How do the changes in the Iron Islands reflect the changing times and attitudes of its people?

Although the prince expects a warm welcome, he is met rather coldly. His uncle, Aeron, a religious zealot meets him at the docks, at Lordsport. Aeron takes Theon back to Pyke where his father, Balon, does not greet him with affection—rather he delivers a series of harsh criticisms that range from questioning where Theon’s loyalties lie to critiquing his fashion sense. When Theon attempts to propose an alliance between the Greyjoys and Robb Stark—the entire reason for his coming, Balon immediately turns the offer down. He reveals that he has his own plans for capturing and ruling the North.

Theon I is a fascinating chapter, because it is really introducing us to several things at the same time: Theon, his family members, and the Iron Islands. We get a lot of information dumped on us for the first time in this chapter, which can be interesting, but also confusing. To make it easier, I’ve divided what we learn into two categories.

**What We Learn About Theon**

*“I must never go far from the sea again.”*

After all, this is a chapter from Theon’s POV, and we learn a lot about his character. This is Theon’s first chapter from his perspective and this is the first time we really get an introduction to him. We’ve seen him in the background of A Game of Thrones, kicking people’s heads and smiling a little too much, but we haven’t really had any substantive look at him, since most of A Game of Thrones’ POVs only think of him in passing (I think if we had a Robb POV, things would be far more Theon-centric). Anyway, George R.R. Martin makes sure Theon leaves pretty bad first impression. Theon is arrogant. Theon is a misogynist. In fact, forget the misogynist part, Theon is pretty much a jerk to everyone. Theon is immature and inexperienced. It doesn’t help that the other characters in the chapter treat Theon with little respect, so it’s easy to mock him. “Theon isn’t even a proper Ironborn,” readers smirk as Balon tears the gold chain off Theon’s chest. At least if you’re going to be the “bad guy,” have some charisma. Overall, the general impression you get of Theon is that he’s not a likeable fellow. “What an ass,” Jon Snow remarks of him in A Game of Thrones, and most readers would probably agree.

Theon is so easy to dislike, that it almost seems dull at first. We aren’t reading ASOIAF because we like stereotypes, after all. However, there’s a catch-- George R.R. Martin is the master of morally grey characters, and Theon is an example of his best work. We haven’t even gotten very far with Theon, and we’re already seeing a really interesting display of raw humanity. As you read through this chapter, look for the nuances in Theon’s character. Below all the arrogance, you’ll find insecurity. Below the smiles, you’ll find sadness. It’s that sadness and that insecurity that will drive Theon’s actions in later chapters. 

**What We Learn About the Ironborn**

*“We do not sow.”*

We learn a lot about the Ironborn in this chapter—touching on both the people at large, and their culture. We also get a chance to meet two representatives of the Ironborn—Aeron and Balon Greyjoy. These brothers play an important part in how we perceive the Ironborn as a whole.
Theon gives us our first look at the raiding lifestyle of the Ironborn when he tells the captain’s daughter about salt-wives and rock-wives. Immediately, we realize that things on the Iron Islands are not (or at least were not) like on the mainland.

In an aside, Theon elaborates on Ironborn culture—“Once I would have kept her as a salt-wife in truth…Once. When we still kept the Old Way, lived by the axe instead of the pick, taking what we would, be it wealth, women, or glory. In those days, the ironborn did not work mines; that was labor for captives brought back from hostings, and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep. War was an ironman’s proper trade. The Drowned God had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song.”

Theon continues to think about how things have changed. “Aegon the Dragon had destroyed the Old Way when he burned Black Harren, gave Harren’s kingdom back to the weakling rivermen, and reduced the Iron Islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm. Yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands, even behind the high stone halls of Pyke. Theon’s father numbered among his titles the style of Lord Reaper and the Greyjoy words boasted that We Do Not Sow.”

Theon (who is naturally recounting the extremely titillating back-history of the Ironborn while having sex at the same time), neatly wraps things up by quickly reminding us of Balon’s rebellion, his hostage status, and his aspirations for the future.
Aeron and Balon also both introduce a key part of the Ironborn culture—namely, the religion of the Drowned God, and the concept of paying the Iron Price.

**Aeron**— We meet Aeron, first. Theon barely recognizes his father’s brother because he has become a religious fanatic over the years that Theon was gone. Aeron reconsecrates Theon to the Drowned God, pouring salt water over his nephews head (“Bless him with salt, bless him with stone, bless him with steel.”) For the first time we hear the words, “What is dead may never die.” This is a phrase that is not only central to the Ironborn religion but also important symbolically for Theon’s character later on.

**Balon**— When Theon finally sees his father, Balon Greyjoy, his father is not particularly happy to see him. In the midst of all the family drama, however, George R.R. Martin teaches us another important lesson about the Ironborn by introducing the concept of “Paying the Iron price.”

““That bauble around your neck—was it bought with gold or iron? Theon touched the gold chain. He had forgotten. It had been so long…In the Old Way, women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin, but a warrior wore only the jewellery he took off the corpses of his enemies slain by his own men. Paying the Iron Price, it was called. “

Paying the Iron Price is an ancient Ironborn tradition. As Theon noted before, it has lapsed along with the Old Way, so Balon is being pretty unfair by calling Theon out for it. That said, again, paying the iron price is a concept that will come up again and again in the Ironborn storyline. It is representative of an entire way of life—a way of life that Theon will try to reconcile with his Northern upbringing to disastrous results. It is extremely impressive how George R.R. Martin can subtly give the reader an entire backstory on a people, in a short amount of time, all so naturally that we do not even realize he is feeding us the information.

**Conclusion**

That brings our first read-through to a finish. What did you enjoy? What can I do work on for next time? Let me know!

**Discuss:**

Do you enjoy Theon’s POV? What were your first impressions of his character? Did they change as you read the chapter?
We see the Iron Islands for the first time in Theon I? What is your first impression? How do you feel your impression is influenced by the bias of the POV?
Things are different than Theon remembers. How do the changes in the Iron Islands reflect the changing times and attitudes of its people?

I can't sit down and write fiction because I'm afraid I'm not going to write something as good as the things I have written before. 

It's very odd. I write non-fiction articles all the time, and I can just sit down and pound them out. It's the same when I do writing for roleplays just for fun. The words flow out of me, uninhibited.  But when it comes to sitting down to do ""serious"" fiction writing--I just can't anymore. I sit down, and stare at the page, and none of my ideas seem good enough. I can just never get anything out.

Do you have any suggestions on combatting this issue? I'm going to school to major in writing, and I know this is what I want to do with my life. I'm just having difficulty doing it at the moment (which of course adds to more fear that makes it even more difficult to write).
