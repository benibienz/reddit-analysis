After all of that, he added the wheels plus the items, when I added my items he removed his items and tried to scam me by removing the wheels...

He had Dragon Lore MW 0.07 and I was interested, I asked how many keys I'd need to add to my Bayonet Ruby 0.018 and he told me to offer and said ""I've been offered a 0.008 + 40 Keys"".

As you know, A Bayo Ruby 0.008 is like 640k + 40k = 680k

Thats enough to get a Lore FN, so it'd be retarded, thats when I found out he was most likely faking it, and I'm like 90% it was a fake, he took a print (http://prntscr.com/awzq9a) Here.

Point 1- He is From USA and the screen is in German
Point 2- The screenshot doesn't show his name on the part of the ""Have"" items on the steam offer
Point 3- He didn't proof me the steam offer on his steam.

My question is, if I report him, can he get a ban? Also have screen of chatlog ofc.
