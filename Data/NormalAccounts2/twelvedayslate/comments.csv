But. I come from a family of strong legal standing (parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins are lawyers). It's sort of in my blood to look at evidence objectively. 

I have consulted many family members who are attorneys - judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. Some say I should go for it, some say I shouldn't. Some know about my rape, some only hear about ""a friend had this happen and I'm seeking advice."" All say there's only circumstantial evidence.

My parents are of European descent, and people would constantly ask my parents, ""What country did you adopt her from"" or say ""how nice of you to adopt a little Asian baby!"" Seriously. It happened ALL. THE. TIME. My other sister? She looked/looks super Latina. Me? I have different color eyes than everyone else in my family, and a different bone structure. I am 1000000% sure my father is my biological father, and that he's the biological father to both of my sisters.

I don't know, maybe recessive genes just run really strong in my family. I remember though as a kid I used to constantly insist I must be adopted. I made up a whole story about it (ugh).

The evidence is not that strong against him. I don't know that a prosecutor would take the case, frankly. 

It's not just the not guilty though. My rapist is a law student where my dad teaches. My dad is well known by the local media, and his name is known by other outlets- he's frequently quoted in the New York Times, Washington Post, he was on TV after Casey Anthony was found not guilty, he's been quoted by People, etc. etc. Safe to say that upon seeing my last name, it could turn into a media circus. 

Even if I could handle a not guilty verdict, a defense attorney calling into question every decision I made that night and calling into question my sexual history... I don't know that I could handle the media. 

It's a lot to consider, and like I said, I'm not rushing. I want to make the right decision for myself. From the outside, it's easy to say the right decision is taking the bastard to court.

I've struggled with one for more than a decade. Probably will for the rest of my life. I would not wish an eating disorder on my worst of enemies.

Unless you have had an eating disorder, you cannot fully understand what it is like to be terrified of food.

639,"Thank you all so much for your kind words. I want to give you all the hugest hug. I wanted to share the story of what happened. 

I get to Rapist's home and he was being a jerk. I asked him his last name and he refused to tell me. I told him that was weird. He was just being... Super stand offish.

The short version is Al and I start kissing, and he said he wanted to have sex with me. I said no, I wasn't going to have sex with him. (This was based on a number of factors, but does the reason why matter?). He looked at me in absolute shock. He kept asking why. Why. Why why why. Finally he said ""can I jack off and cum on you?"" I said ""uhh... Yeah, sure."" Frankly, I thought this was odd, but by this point I had decided I would never see him again. 

He starts rubbing his dick around my vagina and playing ""just the tip."" I asked him not to. I said to stop. I said no. He said it was just the tip, he really liked it. He starts rubbing around my butt and asked if I like anal. I said no. At that point, his dick... Accidentally slipped in my vagina. I backed away and he said ""oh oops. Sorry."" It wasn't a fucking accident. His tip then ""accidentally"" slipped in my butt. This wasn't a fucking accident, either. 

Rapist said he was going to get himself off with just the tip. I said ""no, please don't. That was basically sex. Please don't."" At this point I had said no at least thirty times. 

Rapist was begging me. Saying he needed to. He kept pushing his penis further and further in me while I was saying no. I was crying, but I don't think he knew because he was sitting on top of me. I was wiggling away. I said no again so many times. 

Finally I... Stopped fighting. He kept pushing it further and I stopped. I knew I couldn't fight it. I shut down

He asked if he could cum on me. I said yes, I was on birth control. He asked if I was sure I was on birth control. I said of course I am. This was a lie, as I stated in an above comment - I needed his semen for evidence. 

Finally he came. I sat there in bed crying. I got dressed and left. And went to the hospital. 

He's texted me and called me at least 20 times. ",2016-05-29 20:33:08+00:00,d3odx5r,1.0,t3_4ll0p5,15350.0,TrollXChromosomes

Again, as cold as it sounds, if someone literally cannot survive more than a few minutes without electricity, that... is not the entire responsibility of the electric company. That is not the electric company's job, to be frank. IF the electric company were to account for those customers, everyone else's bills would spike due to the owed debt.

891,"I could get into so much more, but let me ask you this: if you have a doctor's note, is it okay to not pay your bill for six months because you need electricity to live? I promise you, the utility company would lose millions with this.

I have plenty of customers with notes from their doctor, who bribe their doctor into writing a note that says ""it is our medical opinion that this child needs a hot shower because of football so you must not turn off the gas."" ""It is our medical opinion that turning off the lights causes a spike in my child's anxiety so you must never do it."" ""It is our medical opinion that we need a refrigerator [not ice?] to keep the food cold so you must not turn off the electricity."" (Yes, I have heard and seen EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE. ANd more. These are just the ones at the top of my head.)

What? Really?

There is not an electric company, or a gas company, that protects from shut off ever, as far as I know. With a doctor's note, we may give more time to pay the bill. But it is not permanent protection. That is not how any business runs, to be frank.",2016-03-27 05:30:12+00:00,d1ezhjv,8.0,t1_d1ez9wk,550.0,news
892,"&gt; It would be means tested, erring on the side of stingyness. The majority of people who have racked up a large back payment because they are not doing what they can to pay it down would NOT be eligible.

Which is most. The only ones who have a large balance due to other reasons is because of multiple estimated bills. We go above and beyond for these customers to work with them to pay down their balances.

Those who have a large balance due to not making payments? We work with them, too. We have weekly, biweekly, and monthly payment plans. Again, once you have defaulted every single attempted payment plan, though, what can we do? We try and work with you. If you do not put in equal effort, I am sorry. We give you many attempts. It is not ""one strike you're out"" with my company. But at a certain point, you strike out, yes. 

I do not enjoy seeing customers who are disconnected. Customers tell me all the time, ""I am sure you sleep fine!"" No. I feel awful. I am passionate about helping people and I do everything I can for a customer. I have gone to a supervisor to convince them to give the customer another chance. I have gone to the bathroom and cried more times than I care to admit. When you scream at me on the phone, please know I am not a robot.

I am not a cold, hard person. I am very pro-welfare, benefits, etc. There are many, many studies that show that people place all other bills before utility bills. I cannot remember the order, but I know it starts with rent, and then includes cable, internet, phone, etc., and utility bill comes last. That is a problem, and we recognize it.

I understand I am being downvoted. I promise you guys - if you saw my job for a day, you would be saying the same thing, or at least seeing my position more. I would love to have everyone here shadow me for a day and really see the inner workings. A year and a half ago, I probably would have been you. I have seen the other side now.

895,"Everyone who has electric service pays a fee in my state- $0.98 per bill. I live in the same state as the people in this news story. So, there is a fund there. It was signed into law by our governor in 2013.

To start, many people call to fight me over this fund, as if I have control over state legislature. Anyone pays it - low income, middle income, high income, whatever. 

Further, that monthly does cover those who still do not make a payment for months. It does not even begin to cover those who owe over $1,000 on their utility bills (something I see every single hour at my job, no exaggeration). To owe over $1,000 in utility bills, you (typically) have to go a long while without paying your usage.

I am not kidding when I say I talk to people every day, multiple times per day, who have very severe health circumstances, and are calling because they cannot make a payment or they have had their electric (and/or gas) disconnected. 

I don't know what the solution is. Our utility company has payment plans, but those plans require monthly payments. I know things happen- a car breaks down, a kid gets sick, etc. We offer MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS at payment plans.

But. At a certain point, if we have exhausted all of our options, the only option left is, ""Pay your bill."" It is tough to say this to a customer. I have cried before after a call. But... we only have so many options available. 

If your utility company were to add in a ""fair"" cost to help pay for those who are low income, who owe over $1,000, I would easily venture to say you would pay $50-$100 more per month. Easily.

If you are getting gas and  from a company that reports to the public service commission for your state, then the company cannot charge you more than what the gas actually cost them to deliver to your home. 

Did you have a lot of estimated bills and then have a large catch up bill? What was different in the home? How big is the home, and what appliances are using gas? Is there a gas leak? (More than 95% of the time, gas leaks will NOT cause a large bill, but it occasionally can). Have you done an energy audit?

Undoubtedly, paying for gas and electric can be tough sometimes. In the winter months, certainly the bills get higher and it may be harder to pay. But, we only charge for what a customer uses. It frustrates me beyond belief to see people who refuse to pay for their usage.*

1032,"The story, for anyone who cares to read a novel. Also because I need to get it out. 

I've been friends with Mark (name changed for anonymity) for over a year. A few months ago we started sleeping together. Plenty of people thought we were dating- we'd go out to eat together, Netflix and chill, snuggle, had sleepovers 4-5x/week on average, etc. It was a great arrangement. He was my best friend. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and he has been the most fantastic listener ever. 

I introduced Mark to my good friend Katie and we all became friends. About two weeks ago (three weeks after I introduced them), Mark told me he wanted more than sex. He didn't see me as more than a sex partner. He was interested in Katie. I was crushed beyond words. Katie was shocked. I realized only once he told me this that I had feelings for him beyond FWB. It was too little too late. 

Mark was a champ at listening to me. He knew I was hurt. But he desperately wanted to be my bestie still. A few days after he admitted it to me, I sucked up my feelings and we were back to being just good friends again. 

We had plans to go out drinking together at a bar last Friday. Two days before, on Wednesday, i asked him if I could spend the night on his couch if I drank too much. I jokingly said ""or find a random and go home with him!"" He flew off the handle. Said I need to clear it through him, I have no respect for myself by being willing to sleep around (which I don't do). He said I am messy which means I have no respect for myself. I've used conditioner as soap. It was super inappropriate and I told him he cannot speak to me that way. He said he was going to bed. The next morning he texted me back saying he clearly doesn't know how to approach me so he won't. Uh, ok, M. 

I didn't hear from him after that. I texted him on Friday. Even called him. No response. This is so unlike Mark. I texted him late Friday night saying it's fine if he doesn't want to talk to me but please let me know if he's ok. I was worried. No response. Katie texted him Saturday saying we were worried. No response. 

He texted me Saturday night saying he's fine but doesn't want to talk to me, leave him alone, etc. Now, I have one of his pairs of basketball shorts still. He has 3829388181 pairs. He texted me last night saying to bring them to work (oh yeah we work together). I said sure. He was very short with me. I asked him if we could talk, I thought we were friends. He said he only cared about getting his shorts, wouldn't talk, and if I continued asking, he'd block my number. 

This was my best friend. I have no idea why Mark is doing this. I've lost my close confidante, FWB, best friend, and we work two feet from each other.

I don't frequently ""borrow"" money from my dad, but if I pay for something and he decides to pay me back (he pays for one of my medical bills, long story), this makes it easier. Also, this is the way it has been since I first opened my bank account as a teenager, and really, it works? He does not go snooping through my finances, and if I told him I didn't want him to be linked anymore, he would remove himself. 

This IS the way I was raised. I think my dad is tied to my two younger siblings' accounts, too, so it's not just me. If my boyfriend had a serious problem with it, I probably wouldn't respond well, either. This is just the way my family works, and it works for us.

Zach is an asshole, and his behavior towards you was nothing short of reprehensible. Lynn also showed her true colors to you, though: if I recall, you told her how hurt you were, and she brushed you off. He attempted to contact you again and she posted something saying ""bitches get off my husband"" (basically). That isn't a good friend. That isn't someone who is just trying to work on her marriage. That's a toxic friend. So, allow yourself to hurt over the friendship. Allow yourself to grieve the break up. But do not contact her. She has more than shown her true colors. 

Finally, you should ask yourself, **is Lynn trying to contact ME?** Clearly, she is not. I know that hurts to ask, but if she was so concerned with preserving the friendship, she would contact you.

Also, in regards to mutual friends, I see no reason why you can't hang out with them one-on-one.

1229,"First of all, this is not going to be a popular statement, but I think the age gap between you two is troubling. Can a relationship work with age gaps? Yes. But there is such a huge difference in life experiences at 23 vs. 40 that I'm not surprised you are having issues.

Second, your husband is an asshole. He is cheating on you, being shady, and then he says it is your fault. Are you serious? That is not a genuinely caring person, girl. He may say to your face that he is willing to work on things and wants to save your marriage, but his actions tell a different story. He is blaming you for his behavior, he is screaming at you, he is hiding things, he is deleting things, etc.

I do not believe in the saying once a cheater always a cheater. I believe that people can change. But from what you've said, with your husband? If you forgive him and move on from this, he will do it again. He will only be more secretive about it.

Please, save yourself from this toxic marriage. You deserve honesty and kindness, and he is not giving you either. To leave your marriage would not be throwing it away without trying. Your husband broke his marriage vows to you. Many times over. 

At the very least, if you are insistent on saving this marriage (a marriage which I will bet will end in divorce within three more years, tops), demand counseling. Serious counseling. And demand total transparency from him: you have the right to check his phone at any time, his e-mail, his deleted items, etc. If he is not willing to do that or fights you on it? I think you have your answer on whether or not he really wants to save your marriage.

Just remember this: marriage is not supposed to be a martyrdom.

Cry. A lot. Eat food that makes you feel good and drink your favorite wine/liquor/beer (or all the above for added benefits). Allow yourself to feel the grief because yes, you are grieving this relationship.  You are grieving a future you once thought you had. 

And surround yourself with friends. When you feel like you can't breathe, your best girlfriends will be like a third lung for you.

And finally, distract yourself with something, once you get over the initial stages of the break up grief- always wanted to try knitting? Or learn French? Or have you always wanted to take up soccer? Do this. Use it to distract you.

I'll be honest, I don't think exes should hang out one on one. It sounds like you're okay with that though, but even so, I would put my foot down like yesterday. If I were you, I'd say that I don't care that he hangs out with her occasionally, but it makes you really uncomfortable with ex in your home when you aren't there. Period. And I'd add that he needs to clear it with you before he invites her over for dinner. Come on, that's just common courtesy! Manners, man. 

If he gets super defensive? Umm, I hate to say it, but there may be something more going on, OP. It's not an issue of jealousy. Hell, I'm the least jealous person in the world. It's an issue of appropriate boundaries.

Because when they inevitably divorce, she'll come running to a friend like you. I'm not saying be there with open arms, but it may be nice to at least leave one door open for if she ever needs you. 

As far as grieving, take all the time you need. Allow yourself to be sad. And angry. And hurt. Friend break ups can hurt even worse than romantic ones, I've found.

I tried to make John go away by telling him I need to process everything he told me. He was stunned and asked if maybe we can talk about other things in the meantime. And then he asked how long it will take. And OMG I REALLY EXPECT HIM TO WAIT FOR ME? HE THOUGHT HE WAS BEING SO NICE BY OPENING UP TO ME. I will be blocking his number. 

Because of what John has said, I went through a period today where I thought I was overreacting. I had a friend tell me I was. Another friend said, ""ehhhh"" when she heard the story.

1613,"More context: 
My rapist, I'll call him Will, took advantage of how naive I was. I met him at a club. I went over to his house a couple weeks later as a virgin, the plan was for us not to have sex as he knew about my virginity, and he didn't want to take that from me. I guess Will changed his mind and he claimed to be just ""helping"" me. Helping me because I was so young (I was 18, he was 28).
My FWB, I'll call him Tyler, was my friend. After nearly a year, he told me about his conviction. Tyler knew about Will. Tyler claimed that when he was 19, he dated a 15 year old and a year after he broke up with her, her parents came after him. I knew he was lying right away and the police report has much different, more awful details. I hardly ate or got out of bed for a week after finding out about this. 
The third guy, I'll call him John. John and I have been talking for about a week- we talked for a few weeks a couple months ago but it fizzled. He is a psychiatrist with a very successful practice. He just opened up to me that he has a misdemeanor sexual assault charge. He claims he just touched the inside of a girl's thigh, while she was wearing jeans. 
She was John's assistant. She told her boyfriend, they reported it, and then she ""wanted to take it back"" but the court wouldn't let her drop the charges. John said she still wants to take it back but doesn't want to upset her fiancé who pushed her to press charges. I don't believe him for a second. I fully believe that she may have lessened the charges due to pressure being his assistant. Or he pled down. He's mad I won't have a discussion with him about it and his female friends know he's a good guy because he's never assaulted them. 

What the fuck is wrong with me. Not one, not two, but three sexual predators. This always takes me back to what happened with Will. This is awful.",2015-11-11 04:15:06+00:00,cww6l3p,1.0,t3_3sd9a3,130.0,TrollXChromosomes

George comes up, and he literally stomped up three flights.

By this point I am unsettled. He also brought a briefcase- what the hell? He tries to play with my cat, who is terrified and hiding behind the couch. Good kitty. He asks me if ""[dad's name]"" is my dad. I said yes, why. He googled me to ""try to find my apartment number."" Logical.

I told George this was creepy and he said it's not, I might just piss off my neighbors.  

I told him I was on call for work. I was texting my friend and begged my male friend to call me and be my work so I could leave and get George to leave. When my friend did call, I went in the other room and George snuck out of my apartment. 

I am still rattled and terrified. George has sent me many texts, and while I should not have responded, I did. He sees nothing wrong with his behavior and said he only behaved that way because he was lost, thought I was ditching him, etc. He ranted that he is done, asked me if I wanted to start over, then immediately told me again that he's done.

1667,"&gt; We have the right to have sex whenever, and with whomever we want. 

And sometimes men decide for us that we are going to have sex and we have no choice. If this has never happened to you, you are fortunate, but for those women who it has happened to, we know all too well that sex is not always  choice we make as women.

Also, beyond just rape, while we have the right to have sex, women are, by large, judged and called slut/whore/promiscuous/a whole variety of other awful sexist terms for just having sex whenever she wants.

&gt; We have the right to take preventative measures to protect ourselves from unwanted pregnancies.

If you have access to it- not every woman does have access to condoms or other birth control methods. Even more so, in pro-life communities and families, education about sex is often just abstinence-only. Many women simply are not educated about preventative measures.

Also, this sometimes hinges upon if your rapist decides to wear a condom- mine did not, and I typically think rapists do not say, ""Hold on while I rape you, let's get some protection first."" For a few weeks after my rape, my period was late. I remember going to the bathroom a hundred times a day to see if my period had come. This is the moment I switched from pro-life to pro-choice. I remember crying, willing my period to come, willing my body not to have any bit of my rapist growing inside me. 
 
&gt; We have the right to medical care

Do we? There are many women that do not have access to medical care. If you are middle or upper class, sure, you have this luxury. But here in the United States, medical care is exactly that, a luxury. 

Let's not forget that once this child is born, if you are forcing birth, there are very few resources to help single, poor mothers. If you are going to say ""then give up your baby for adoption,""  you should look up some statistics on how the adoption system, by large, favors cute, white babies without any disabilities.

I'm not sure if you're in therapy but it may help to go for a few sessions just to talk about it and process what Zach did. What he did to his wife is awful, but you have every reason to be angry, too. He harassed you and made you very uncomfortable. He put you in an awful position.

If my friend kept this information from me, not only would I dump my husband, but I'd dump her as a friend. The betrayal would feel just as awful. 

As far as how, I would invite her out to lunch or, even better, out for drinks. I'd tell her what happened and show her the texts if necessary. Be prepared for her to storm off in anger. Please know that she is not angry with you, but this will be hard for her. 

Also, remember in the future that looks of a relationship can be deceiving. Clearly they are not the perfect couple. If you're not in a relationship, you cannot possibly know what goes on there.

1758,"Refusing to allow kids at a wedding always kind of rubs me weirdly. But not even allowing your own brothers at your wedding? That is hugely extreme and a dick move, in my honest opinion. I can't help but think that it stems from jealousy that your dad will take any attention off if you, and you wanting it to go back to the ""good old days"" of just you and him. But... Sorry, sister. Those days are gone. He has two new children and a new wife. That doesn't make you any less important, but it does mean you're not the only person his world revolves around now. 

It's your wedding and ultimately your choice. I think if you refuse to allow your siblings, it will be super alienating to your dad's new family. It is your wedding. Most of his attention will be on you, I promise. He will still be able to walk you down the aisle, have his first dance with you, etc. I don't think any of that is taken away by allowing your kid siblings to attend. If one of the kid's will freak out without your dad holding him, maybe his wife can take the kid to a separate room during important moments so it's not disruptive?

But I fail to see how the presence of your brothers makes the wedding less about you in anyway. If anything, I think having them ere signifies even more the joining of families. 

Also, you say you want these parents to have a fun night off from their kids. For some parents, they want that. Some prefer to do everything as a family. There's nothing wrong with either choice. I don't think there's anything wrong with your dad and his wife spending every night, no nights off, from their kids since they were born. Clearly that makes them happy.

He currently works as a political consultant and has met/interned with/associated with some ""big names"" in politics- Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, etc. He previously worked as a ""political director"" for a senator in our state. He's still fairly young (30, I think?), but I know he plans to be a U.S. Senator one day. I laughed after we had sex the first time when I told him I just had sex with a future senator. Our views are very similar, but the thought of seeing his name on the ballot one day does make my stomach do flips. Our brief dating adventure ended with him smacking me across the face. Fuck no you do not do that to me. 

He would be very well-liked in politics, I have no doubt. He's young, attractive, very well dressed (seriously), and charismatic. He's very intense and focused, and that's what drew me to him. But he also (clearly) has a dark side.

When I first lost the weight, I was incredibly self conscious about my loose skin. Thankfully, it's always been in places that can be hidden- my stomach and my boobs. At the same time, it would make me incredibly self conscious in intimate situations. I would try and hide my loose skin from guys. I would also get really frustrated when bathing suit or bra shopping because I liked this new body but had to choose certain suits that wouldn't push up my loose skin. Seriously haha. Push up bras would only push up my loose skin. It's funny now but at the time it was frustrating as hell!

I've m sort of come to accept the loose skin as a battle wound, though. I'm also fortunate enough that since I'm so young, it has tightened up a little. Only a little, though. I joke that if I bend over, I have a kangaroo pouch (true story lol ask for pictures if you must see). Someday after I have children I may get plastic surgery to tighten up, or I may not. Loose skin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 70 pounds of excess weight, so at least I have that going for me. ",2015-09-22 04:12:52+00:00,cv9v5fu,2.0,t1_cv9tg6d,3345.0,progresspics
1810,"I tracked every single thing that went in my mouth (ha). Seriously. I don't care if it was two chips. It's so easy to say, oh just a handful of goldfish and a small bite of pie and rationalize away a few hundred calories (or more!) everyday. Nutrition is, by far, the biggest piece of weight loss. I also didn't allow myself any cheats for the first two months. ""That is so restrictive! I cannot do it,"" you say. It's 60 days. Yes you can. You need to retrain your mind and how you think about food. I especially wouldn't let myself near my problem foods for those first couple months. I couldn't trust myself to not go crazy like I would before. Now, after a few months, when I know portion size better and can trust myself with those foods? Then you can introduce them back in, sure. I do everything in moderation now. But if I knew what moderation was before, well, I never would've been 200 pounds. 

Second, I got off my butt and moved! At 200 pounds, you better believe everything jiggled. I was self conscious at the gym. Since getting fit, I realized though that truly, no one cares about anyone else at the gym. No one is judging that overweight person. I focus on my own work out and I hardly notice anyone else. This is from a practically professional people watcher!

As far as keeping off the weight, I've learned you can't get lazy. You don't just lose 70 pounds and say, ""Ok, my work is done."" No. That is the attitude that caused me to gain 10 pounds again! You have to keep working at it all your life. Sure, some days and weeks will be bad. But you can't fall into the trap of ""I lost the weight so now I can coast on autopilot."" Maintenance, in my opinion, is about 50x harder than weight loss. 

I fluctuate still. I think everyone does, especially women. I still have days where I feel huge and I forget how far I've come. Food is meant to be enjoyed. Food is not meant to be taken to the excess, though. Food should never be a reward- you are not a puppy. While I say that maintenance is harder, it's also 100x more fun.

Also, if you limit her drinking around this guy, it's only a short jump away from limiting her drinking around all mixed company- why would she be more likely to cheat when drinking with this guy than any other? Plus, if everyone in a party is getting wasted and she can't because of your rules, because this guy she happened to hook up with in the past is there, that really seems unfair.

With Matt, I would tell him, ""Please do not make comments about my eating choices."" Be firm. If he's a good friend to you, he will respect that.

Email them any time you have a question (but don't be that annoying shit who sends the professor 30 emails a day to suck up, be reasonable here). The more you get to know your professors, the easier classes are. I promise. The guy who gets to know his professor can get a boost up when he's on the borderline between a B+ and an A-. Plus, it helps down the road with references.

4. Branch out and try new things. This is one of the few opportunities in life you have to completely re-invent yourself. Join a club that sounds interesting. Colleges have clubs for everything. If you want to, rush a frat. Try and meet and make friends with all different types of people. Don't be clique-y like you always are in high school. College really opens your eyes.

5. Don't decide your major going in right away. Take classes that seem interesting to you in your first year, and you'll find what you want to study. 

6. Always use a condom. This one is self-explanatory.

7. Don't do drugs and never leave your drink unattended. This one is also self-explanatory. 

8. Be nice to your roommate. You have to live with the person, and no one likes a hostile living situation. When you first move in, set up some guidelines and talk about all different situations- overnight guests, one night stands, drinking in the room, studying habits, how late you stay up at night, etc.

9. Don't wear your high school varsity jersey around school. You'll look like you are stuck in the past. 

10. You're going to make a lot of mistakes in college, but especially in your first year. It's (probably) your first time on your own. Don't go running home every time you do something stupid. If you fuck up, apologize. If you're embarrassed, know that people will forget it in about 24 hours- no one is thinking about you as much as you are. You have to forgive yourself for making mistakes, and remind yourself that you are human, and you're still figuring out who you are. Mistakes are how we grow.

Just focus on your work as much as possible. Do not speak to either of them unless spoken to. Do NOT ask any questions about their relationship, it only hurts you more. Eventually, it will get easier.

In the mean time, I would advise looking for a new job, and I would advise therapy to help you recover from the abuse that you suffered by Eddie. If you can't look for a new job, at the very least ask if you can move desks away from Sarah.

2215,"I'm a rape survivor and this post made me cry. From one survivor to another, I am so sorry. I felt like I have to respond to you.

After I was raped, I completely shut down. I entered into a complete fog. I'm not sure I felt anything for a long while after I was raped, and looking back, I hardly remember that time period. It's now been years for me, and yes, I can assure you it gets easier. Does it ever go away? No. Does it become manageable? Yes, it absolutely does.

You don't need to make a decision about your relationship right now, and you don't need to pressure yourself into thinking you need to leave your fiance because he deserves better. I know you are lost in grief for the person you were before you were raped (grief will sound inappropriate to anyone who wasn't raped; anyone who was will get it), and in this period, I don't think you should be making huge, life changing decisions. Your mind cannot process it. You need to focus on healing yourself. It's fantastic you are in therapy, and I am so proud of you to read that. It's okay to be selfish right now. You are being incredibly selfless, but tell yourself it's okay to make YOU a priority. You have to.

Instead of thinking about how you are burdening your fiance, remind yourself that he loves you. He is with you and doing all this for you because he *wants* to help you. You're not burdening him. When you get married, you will promise for better or for worse. This is your worse, yes, but he's sticking it through with you. Let him be the back bone of the relationship right now.

Also, fuck anyone who tries to tell you that you have to press charges. If you want to, you can certainly contact the cab company and I am sure you could find those men. But if that's too much, if you cannot emotionally handle pressing charges, I am here to you tell you this: **that's okay.** People who haven't been raped think you MUST press charges. I would never tell a survivor not to, but I would empower a survivor to make his/her own choices in regards to going to the police. The fact that I did not press charges is one of the best choices I ever made for my recovery. I'm happy to expand on this for you or anyone. 

Please message me at any time. I know you are grieving right now, I know you are in despair. I promise you, one day it will get easier. Until then, take things day by day.",2015-08-09 03:01:52+00:00,ctwiogv,1.0,t3_3gb1hb,3315.0,relationships

2339,"I don't know if there's such thing as temporary mental illness.

But for a time a few years back, I was regularly experiencing debilitating panic attacks. It felt like a really long time, but really it was over the span of probably about six months. I was never suicidal or depressed or anything, but I remember yelling to my therapist at one point, ""I feel like my mind is trapped in Alcatraz!"" I really did. I was either experiencing a panic attack or fearing one. The panic attacks weren't mild, either. I remember crying to my mom during one that I couldn't take a nap because I was convinced I wouldn't wake up. Each one made me feel like I was dying, and it was multiple times a day.

I was also making a lot of poor choices during this time period, so I'm sure that did not help matters.

I'm a lot more stable now, but I will probably always have panic attacks. Instead of a few times a day, it's now only a few times a year. I take medication and I maybe take Xanax only once every six months or so, which is better than feeling like I need it once every six hours (I did not take it that often in the midst of hell, by the way!).

2462,"Absolutely not. 

I have a family history of alcoholism. Both my dad and grandmother are/were alcoholics (Dad is sober since before I was born, Grandma passed away). I'm pretty sure this means I'm at least 10x more likely to develop a problem. 

But does this mean I'm doomed to become an alcoholic? No. I'm drinking right now and stopping after drink numero uno. It's important that you recognize family history, and kind of check yourself if you see yourself going too far, but genetics does not determine your fate. Plus, alcoholism can happen to anyone, genetics or not. 

Even studies will say ""you are x-times *more likely* to become an alcoholic if you have this in your family history."" Never does, and never will, a study say, ""You are definitely going to become an alcoholic."" You have the power to decide how your life with drinking will go. If you become an alcoholic, that is unfortunate, but genetics are not the sole blame. But you seem like you're doing fine. I know I drank a lot more when I was 19, and I'm in my 20s now and I'm perfectly fine. 

Moral of my novel: be aware, but don't let it stop you from having a drink. If you find yourself developing a problem, then sure, you can worry, but you are not doomed to a life of homeless alcoholism in ten years. ",2015-07-31 05:50:56+00:00,ctmi21s,1.0,t3_3f9a0v,337.0,AskMen

2525,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. Let me be clear about one thing, though: he is not the love of your life. The love of your life will not treat you poorly, he will not act so selfishly, and he will not talk to you disrespectfully. I know you're hurting right now, but I hope you can take a little bit of comfort in knowing how you deserve so much better.

Now, cry all you want. Cry your heart out.  Grab a bottle of wine if you want, and have some drinks and listen to sad music or movies and have a sob fest for a few days. It's okay to cry on the bathroom floor for a few days after a tough break up. 

At some point, call your friends. You need them right now. Call your good friends, and get together with them. This will be a distraction, however minor, from the fact that your heart is broken apart at the seams. In addition to call your friends, find something you can do (something that doesn't remind you of him!) that can give you a distraction. Pick up knitting. Start to learn a new language. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's a kind of mindless distraction for you.

And give it time. Heart break does heal, but it does take time. You will get to the point where you can see that this was a good thing, and you will get to the point where you can think of him without bursting into tears and feeling sick to your stomach. I promise. It gets better.

Lastly, I thought I'd share this quote with you. It's helped me a lot lately:
&gt; Things didn’t work out because, well, greater things were in the works. It’s so difficult while we’re blind and hurting and don’t know which way is up. But, if you have faith in anything, have faith in the fact that the universe has a beautiful way of straightening things out far better than we ever could. You may not see it today or tomorrow, but you will look back in a few years and be absolutely perplexed and awed by how every little thing added up and brought you somewhere wonderful– or where you always wanted to be. You will be grateful that things didn’t work out the way you once wanted them to.

Have you made it clear to your SO how important birthdays are to you? Maybe he figures, because you already had your birthday dinner and everything, he doesn't need to go all out today or anything. If he's not all about birthdays, he may truly not realize i and not have thought twice about his actions. I agree he definitely should've wished you happy birthday, but when you were upset when he said he was going to Kendo, you should have said something. You shouldn't have just said ""oh."" He's not a mind reader.

When he comes home, just make your desires known. Say that birthdays are really important for you, and it hurt your feelings that he didn't really seem to acknowledge it.

2625,"Definitely! I haven't really thought about both Sam and Brad much in the sense of how the relationships began, and how similar they were in the beginning! That comment was super, super therapeutic for me, almost. I see now how I need to stand on my own two feet when something bad happens.

At the same time, the two events that occurred were so horrific (and very, very related, in a super weird way!) that I understand my decision process. After Event #2, I remember lying in bed and being nearly unable to move except to go to work for a few days. Sam, I chalk that up partially to age. Brad, I partially chalk that up to the fact that Bad Event #2 brought me right back where I was when I was 19. I pray nothing like either event happens again, but I also recognize I need better coping skills.

I also see how, when I am in a bad place, it can cloud my decision making skills. Sam and I were like fire and gasoline. Not good together. Brad and I didn't fight often, but we had some serious differences that would have made it hard to have a forever type of relationship (which I think he ultimately hoped for, though he never admitted it). That is more of a big takeaway, for me.

Of course, let's hope I never have an event in my life like either one I experienced prior to Sam and Brad ;-)",2015-07-21 04:45:11+00:00,ctakfsv,12.0,t1_ctakaz8,305.0,casualiama
2626,"Haha. I hate telling the story of the latter; I don't mind the former.

The one I was in love with, let's call him Sam because names are easier. I was 19 when I met him, and he was 21. That seems like such a big difference when you are 19 and when you're not legal to drink. I have realized, many years since we first met, that Sam is a sociopath. He could charm anyone. He could literally sell you a ketchup Popsicle when you were wearing white gloves before your wedding. Conveniently, he is now a used car salesman, haha. So, part of it was my age, sure. I was naive, and he was... older. Wiser. He almost had this protective vibe to him, you know? I liked that. I was also a fucking mess when I met him. I had just lived through the worst event of my life, and I couldn't process it. He swept me away, completely. Maybe a week after he met he started talking about our future, and he promised me an amazing life. I loved that.

I fell in love with Sam almost instantly, and we were on and off for five years after that. Pretty much the moment I first saw him, I knew he was special. I latched onto him and couldn't let him go. There were a lot of complicated issues in our relationship, lots of cheating on his end, abuse (never physical), and plenty of reasons why I should not have stayed. If anything, that made me cling onto Sam even tighter. I know if said worst event of my life never occurred, I never would have gone to Sam, as he was kind of my escape. 

My other ex, we'll call him Brad. Brad and I met through a long time friend of mine, and I had recently reconnected with her. We weren't at that stage yet where we were close, but it's like I wanted to be, haha. She told me a few months before I met him he was like, the perfect guy for me. So I almost had this idea in my mind that I *wanted* him to be a good match. We met and we had the exact same sense of humor- we're very, very sarcastic, and I liked that. Part of the reason I agreed to go out with him after meeting him at a party (where I got black out drunk and hardly remember anything) was because of our mutual friend. He was SUPER close with her, and I wasn't as close. Also, their friend group is awesome. It's not that he was my ticket into them, but I knew good could come of our relationship. I knew he was a good guy and a healthy option, and Sam and I had just finally broken up a couple months earlier. Does that make sense?

Brad and I went out on a couple dates, and I liked him. He made me laugh and we had fun. After maybe our second date, the second worst event of my life occurred, and the first most shocking event occurred. I promise I don't just cling to people when bad shit happens ;-) But I knew if I didn't have Brad, I... wouldn't be okay. I guess I saw him as really stable, really healthy, and I knew without his presence, I would have gone off and made some really unhealthy decisions after that event occurred. Before I even met Brad, between Sam and Brad, I guess you could say I kind of lived a fast life- I was having unprotected sex with men, I was getting involved with sketchy people, etc. Brad balanced that out, and that made me fall for him. I also loved that he was nothing like Sam. Brad and I had a really good relationship overall, it just wasn't meant to be.

2655,"When something happens, big or small, you want him to be the first to know. When you are happy, you want to celebrate with him; when you are sad, you want to cry to him. His happiness is more important than your own (to a point!), and you can't be truly happy if he is devastated over something. At the same time, you know that sometimes, both people can't be strong; you have to be strong for the other, and that's okay.

When you are with him, you feel like you are at home. His quirks are not just something to tolerate, but you kind of like them, too, in a funny way, even if those same quirks annoy you. You get angry with each other sometimes, sometimes you may not even like each other, but even in all that anger and hurt, you know the love is still there, and that is what propels you to forgiveness. 

With my ex, loving him was a battle every single day, and I should not have loved him. Love does not have to make sense. Love does not mean you have to stay with someone, either. Sometimes the most loving act is to walk away from someone who you know is being destructive. But I did love him. More than I thought possible. Being with him everyday felt like going to bed on Christmas Eve by the fire, all warm and secure, and also waking up on Christmas morning, with the excitement of what was to come. I hope to have a love like that again someday.

He also does not want to be your boyfriend. I know that sounds mean. But you know it's true, too. He has proven himself to be unfaithful and sketchy. What, exactly, makes this guy boyfriend material; what even makes him worthy of conversation with you?

He hasn't put a label on you guys because he doesn't want to. In the beginning, sure, you guys were smitten. But he's pulling away. A guy who wants to be your boyfriend is not going to only see you every other week. Everyone is busy all the time with work. That's being an adult. I make time for the people I don't want to see; for people who aren't a priority to me, I tell them that work has me so busy. It's not untrue, and I will get around to seeing these people, but if they were a priority, I would make time, you know?

It's swell that everything is great when you guys are together, but not altogether surprising. I'm sure he enjoys spending time with you! I'm sure you're wonderful.

Other than that, give it time. Tell your girlfriend how sorry you are. This may be the end of the relationship, but it may not be. If she sees how sorry you are and how willing you are to make it up to her, you MAY be able to get through this. Don't keep hounding her, that will just annoy her.

I'm sorry you're hurting so much. Give it time. Getting over a relationship of that length takes TIME. Make sure you go no contact, and this includes deleting her on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., so you are not tempted to cyber stalk her and see what she's up to. You need to focus on healing, instead of focusing why she did what she did. I don't know, no other Redditors know, and you will most likely never know. That's okay.
