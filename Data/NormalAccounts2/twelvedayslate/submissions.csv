He recently graduated law school and he's studying for the bar exam, and so he's understandably stressed out. So far he's been nice to me, but it's clearly very casual.

My parents are lawyers, and they teach law school. My mom helps people do bar prep. She knows I met a guy who's studying for the bar (he knows I told her this) and I told her she's stressed and she just told me to have him email her if she has any questions at all. She gets emails all the time and it's no big. I told him I had something to tell him but would wait to tell him in person and joked it was a surprise. I didn't mean to make it into a big thing. He was like, what, do you have all the answers to the bar? ;) I was like nah, but similar to that. Finally I told him what I wrote above. Here was his reaction, over text.

&gt; Him: seriously?
&gt; 
&gt; Me: what?
&gt; 
&gt; Him: that's retarded
&gt; 
&gt; Him: I gotta get back to studying retard.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: do not call me a retard.
&gt; 
&gt; Me: next time you do, I swear I won't hook up with you again.
&gt; 
&gt; Him: retard
&gt; 
&gt; Him: lol
&gt; 
&gt; Me: I'm pretty sure that's your way of saying you don't want to hook up with me again.
&gt; 
&gt; Him: are you being serious right now?
&gt; 
&gt; Him: I gotta get back to studying now.

Thoughts, anyone? Am I overreacting? Would you be offended by this? I really, really hate the word retard. But it's not so much about the word, really, as it is the fact that I told him to never call me that again, and then he did so IMMEDIATELY AFTER. If he said ""oops"" or ""sorry"" or really anything else, I would've dropped it immediately. 

Also, I should add that I've been in a LOT of toxic situations with men- hook ups, relationships, etc. I'm super, super cautious to avoid getting in another toxic situation and don't want to just be blinded by fun times and a hot guy.

**TL;DR: started a FWB situation recently. He told me I'm a retard. I told him to never call me that, and he immediately called me it again. Not sure what to think or whether I should see him again.** ",relationships,"I [25F] recently started hooking up with a new guy [32F], in a very casual way.
