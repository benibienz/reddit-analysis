137,"Hey, I'm about to order them, just want to make sure that the DT770 80ohm are the right choice - - -

* Budget - Price of the DT770 aka about $175 (at least that's the CZK equivalent of it here in Czech Rep.)

* Source - I am really confused/having a dilemma, one half says that the difference between phone/motherboard and external AMP/DAC is really tiny, other half says they sound much, much better with amp, so, should I get an amp for them? If yes, and if my budget for amp is like $40-60, I should probably go for some of the FiiO amps, right? (I'd like the theoretical amp to be at least somewhat remote as these headphones will travel with me here and there)
 
* Requirements for Isolation - I don't care much about the sound leaking out, but I'd like at least some seal so I don't get bothered by car/bus (currently problem with my Superlux HD681, for the music to be somewhat clear, the headphones are pulling full blast and the treble makes my head hurt

* Preferred Type of Headphone - Over ear only, please.
Preferred tonal balance - I like colorful music, but I'm not a basshead, check preferred music to get some clue (from other's experiences, the DT770 seems to fit well with the music)

* Preferred Music - Tyler The Creator, Hopsin, Flume, Damian Marley, nuages. Mostly rap/hip-hop and EDM genres

I heard that they are bassier than the other two versions, do they then lack in higher frequencies? Will the highs be unpleasant? I'm having this issue with my current HD681s (the highs are piercing my ears in certain songs) 

Is it more of a fun headphone, or a neutral one? Every review I read says otherwise, one says they're neutral, good for studio use, other reviews say that they're warm, fun headphones. Where's the truth? I would say they'd be more on the warm side, since they're closed back,but not sure. What about treble? I'm not a treble head, just wondering how does it sound. 

And the last one - What amp? I know they can be played without one, but apparently they lack a bit. I don't need it to be portable, I'll be bringing them out, but I don't mind to take them ampless, he'll, I'd prefer that. So, I'd like cheap for good quality, like $60 tops.

354,"Hey, I'm basically reposting this as I adjusted my budget a bit and am more certain knowing what I want to upgrade, hope nobody minds! :) 

Budget - $140, surely not going above $160 (unless it's with amp) 

Source -PC, might be amp in the future, I'll talk about that more lower

Requirements for Isolation - Don't need any isolation at all, but would like the headphones to be closed as I like warm music. 

Preferred Type of Headphone - Over ear, maybe in ears but they'd have to be worth it as I like warm music

Preferred tonal balance - I really like colorful, warm sound, no need for accurate monitors. 

Past headphones - Superlux HD681 EVO, I like them a lot, for the price they're unbeatable IMO, but I find the highs kinda painful, for example in 20syl - ongoing thing - the snares that start at like 0:10 don't feel really good

Preferred Music - Mainly EDM (trap, future, bass, electro swing, and some DnB, mainly artists like Flume, 20syl, Lucian, ODESZA), Rap (Hopsin, Tyler The Creator, Eminem, Logic, G-Eazy), also, which might sound weird compared to these, some classical music, although if it could cripple the quality of the genres mentioned higher, this can be ignored. 

What would you like to improve on from your set-up - I like the bass, although there might still be a bit more (I'm no basshead though). Mainly higher quality highs 

Build quality isn't that much of a concern, these won't likely be carried anywhere, so I don't need any tanks. 

I am interested in the DT770s, I know they're more natural, less bassy, but I wouldn't mind that if the rest was good. I'm sure the 250ohm would be pain to run without amp (they cost about $130 here), the 80ohm would still be muffled AFAIK (~$135) and the 32ohm I feel like I'd be left out due to the low impedance, surprisingly they're the most expensive of these (~$145). I would consider amp and the 80ohms, but all decent amps seem to start around $60.

Location: Czech Republic, most headphones seem to be cheaper here than in the US. Amps on the other hand...

Will you be using these Headphones in Public? Nope, home only 

Preferred Type of Headphone - Over ear, no IEMs I've ever tried fit me, and all on ears I tried were uncomfortable (but none of them were great quality either, so I'm open to suggestions)

Yeah, because people on PC are having issues, not on xbox

&gt;They won't shut the fuck up about it here and go to an official forum where they may actually have a positive impact instead of just trying to spread negativity in a general Forza fan community.

The dev(s) themselves are posting here, asking for details of the stuttering etc.

Yeah, guess what, there was another survey about which forza and where are people playing on this sub, about 60% was FH3 on PC, then out of that, about 80% are having stuttering issues, definitely not a minority.

The numbers in the survey just don't lie, you're trying to make up shit, 88% of PC players in this sub are having issues, about 60-80% of people are on PC.

838,"Adding better pedals would be pain in the ass, the g27 pedals have connector with one more pin, to connect them you'd have to rewire the pedals over gamepad buttons, and even then, it will work poorly (own experience). 

Unless you can get the DFGT pedals, or get the quite expensive Leo Bodnar adapter, you probably can't do much. That being said, I don't think the pedals you have are that much worse than the DFGT which are very soft and plasticy feeling. 

Believe me, the DFGT is sitting on my desk right now, currently getting a deal on T300, I'm not trying to shame it, it's awesome wheel and has FFB comparable to the bigger boys like G27/29, hell $8 is absolutely insane deal, even if it's just the wheel, I got it for ten times that (with pedals) and that is still considered a very nice deal. 

For the game, I'd also recommend AC, you want to drift? You have great drift cars in the base game and plenty of awesome mods, you want to drive rally? There is also a fairly nice amount of rally cars to be downloaded, you want GT cars? Yeah there are like... all of them in there haha. Really though, the mod support is insane with that game, I don't know what it is, but I like it way more than rFactor, LFS etc. (maybe not the correct mods?)

With motherboards it can get interesting, but unless you plan on getting Z (OCable) motherboard, you can get motherboard for Skylake for around $50.

1146,"Reposting this from the last thread, got no response. Just one question to start with: Koss Porta Pro/KSC21/KSC75, which sound the best in terms of warm, bassy music? 

So after trying hard I found out that no IEM just fits me, so I am looking for a compact alternative to use in bed/lightweight pack with myself on road. My budget is about $30, is there a different option than the Koss Porta Pro/Sporta Pro/KSC21/KSC75? Also, which one is probably the best out of these? I'd prefer the KSC due to the killer compactness, but they all would work. 

I've seen some IEMs that have these olastic/rubber behind the ear holders, but my problem with IEMs is that they just pop out no matter how hard I push them in, they just slide out, so not sure if this would help me. And even then, I didn't really like the sound and fit of any IEMs, so if it would be possible, I'd like to avoid them. 

I currently have Superlux HD681 EVO and KZ ATE PRO. I listen mostly to rap and EDM if that even matters in this price range. 

With these I'll be playing music only/95% from phone, so 3.5mm or Bluetooth. 

Thank you! 

EDIT: ALSO! I wear glasses, not sure if that affects the decision in any way, haven't had problems with any headphones so far, just want to make sure.

She also looks very different in the newest video when she is inside where people found the bruises, not just because the weird, almost scared face, but her whole face seems to have kinda different shape, much more bony. Could be the fact that she didn't have that much of a makeup on herself. In this video though, and on the streams she's done yesterday, she looked normal again.

Well whatever she's on (if it's anything, she might just in fact have changed), I'm glad she's not being abused/kidnapped or hurt.

I honestly didn't know who she is 48 hours ago, now, although I don't really have to watch the videos (not into the fashion blogging etc) I feel like I've known her for years, lol.

Also - watch pro matches, it helps insanely, just focus on what they do, how they move, the biggest problem of newbies is the mouse placement, they keep aiming basically at the ground, which is the worst thing you can do - first, you see basically nothing, second, if enemy appears you have to adjust your aim, and by the time you do that you'll be dead.

Of course I can, why do you think I can't?

&gt;First of all, you're calling me on ""I'm using Windows XP and I don't want anything else"" attitude. I was among the first users of Windows 10.

So? You tried it and find it shit because of stuff you can easily fix yourself, classic muh XP attitude.

&gt;Difference between you and me is that I know what's shit and you don't.

Could you come up with worse thing to say? ""My opinion is different than yours but your is shit and mine is right"". Also, any way to back yourself up?

&gt;Then it changed my user directory name after one huge update and that fucked up a whole 

&gt;It always booted me into some weird temporary profile. Online solutions like switching to local account etc. didn't help and the whole OS was unusable.

Damn, your definition of unusable OS is quite strict

&gt;It does send metadata, it's not that harmful but still it does it without your permission. Like it does with updates.

And then again, which you for some reason ignored, so does Google, Facebook, Apple, every large company. I don't see reason why would you give a shit unless you store something illegal on your PC.

&gt;And the fact that you have to use that ""anti-botnet"" software is sad.

That's the solution for tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists like you. And also, your definition of botnet gave me a good chuckle

&gt;You seriously think that one software can really disable ALL privacy related things in a closed-source operating system? Are you this dense?

It blocks outgoing information, former veteran Windows developer himself said it's a really good tool. (inb4 ""paid to say that"")

&gt;And yeah, I don't need classic shell on Win 10 but it's matter of preference I guess. Win 8/8.1 is basically unusable without it.

I don't see how 8.1 is unusable without it, you know there's quite fuckload difference between 8 and 8.1? The 8.1 UI is basically identical to 7/10

&gt;I don't care about support, Windows 8.1 will allegedly be supported until 2024. or so. Until then GNU/Linux gaming will rise and I won't be forced to use Windows.

Heh or maybe Linux won't exist, or maybe it will be on the same level as it is now. You can't be so sure to say it as a fact.

&gt;But what I'm trying to say here is that you can't trust closed-source software.

Okay, let me go and force everybody into thinking that the government keeps spying on us, also let me join scientology church. If you want real privacy in today's world, well... good luck! By throwing a letter into trash you're exposing yourself to identity theft.

&gt;You may have illusion of security, maybe you're secure after all (which I doubt since MS is in Prism project), but you're never sure.

But yeah, there are people who basically cry about muh privacy. These people know dogshit about what Windows sends about them on W7/W8.1, what Google sends about them from everyday Google/YouTube searches, what Facebook sends about them from their everyday Facebook/Instagram activities. If they knew, they'd probably be in singalproof shelter crying in corner with tinfoil hat.

Basically all these companies are sending **at least** metadata (metadata is unharmful, anonymous data which says how long are you using the service, how long, at which times, where you tend to click, what options you use etc.). And so does MS, but because you actually have the option to disable some of these data sharing, more people know about what is actually being sent and then proceed to blame the living shit out of MS (huh, guess I should say M$ because that's the rather awesome trend, company that makes money, woah, unbe fucking lieveable, how dare they?/s) 

The ""free"" part ends quite soon (not for already upgraded W10 users), then it will be the normal $100 or what some basic version of Windows costs. It's free, because it's Microsoft's last OS which will be continuously updated (like OS X by Apple) to new versions, sometimes complete redesigns etc. so logically they want as many people as they can get on it, that's why they keep sending all these annoying notifications to remind you that you can upgrade (It's annoying, I agree with that, but at the same time I understand it) for free, and that you should do it etc.

DFGT isn't sold anymore but you can get used one for pretty cheap (I got mine for like $50), but the pedals are meh (plastic, weird, soft feeling and mainly without clutch) you can buy G27 pedals, but you'll have to re-solder the cables to work with DFGT, I Have it like that. Then, they also don't have shifter with H layout, only sequential, you can buy Driving Force Shifter, but you'd also have to get adapter for it so you can connect it to USB port.

G27 comes with both good pedals and the shifter, they also aren't sold, but they tend to have high price second hand, since the newest model (G29, which is just rebrand without shifter, lol) is more expensive and people thing g27 is ""rare"". You still can find it for $80 if you keep your eye on ebay or craigslist long enough.

[T500rs](http://www.thrustmaster.com/products/t500rs) is high end by Thrustmaster, it has the best force feedback out of these, best pedals. But it comes without shifter, you can buy either the Driving Force shifter, but it feels quite plastic, so if you'd go for this one, I'd recommend the TH8A shifter which costs around $120 but you can get used one for much cheaper.

Then you can get the [Fanatec bundle](https://www.fanatec.com/us-en/module/configurator;bundle_id;96) for $1400, or build your own on the [Fanatec website](https://www.fanatec.com/us-en/), but I highly doubt you'd like to do that as your first purchase, haha.",2016-07-18 10:35:22+00:00,d5gnk3o,4.0,t1_d5gajzj,32379.0,pcmasterrace

* **CoD MW3** (haven't played in years) with **271 hours**

* **War Thunder** with **260 hours**

* **TF2** with **159 hours**

#By enjoyment:

* **GTA V** (436 hours) - still enjoying it a lot, even just fucking around in singleplayer

* **Dishonored** (24 hours) - I have times more hours in this game, but I have to admit that I've played pirate version for a long time. Nonetheless it's GOTY 2012-now for me. Can't wait for DH2

* **ETS 2** (73 hours) - Plenty of fun with wheel, also lots of mods

* **TrackMania Nations Forever** (31 hours on steam, although I have nonsteam United version, that would be circa 600+ hours) - Just awesome game to play with friends

* **Insurgency** (45 hours) Really good action, very well done game.

* Also **Mount &amp; Blade: Warband** deserves mentioning, I have it on older Steam acc, but shared to my current one and it's so much fun with mods like Gekokujo od Diplomacy. **Together 97 hours on record**

Blow off valve (BOV) is basically a little valve that you mount on the turbo, it opens up when you release the gas and it blows the left off air in the turbo away to the hood. It's better for the turbo, as it releases the air pressure that would stay in it and therefore increases its lifespan. Most of the time it makes either this STUTUTU sound or also a ""I can't whistle but I'm trying"" PHUUUU sound. You can find lots of BOV compilations on YouTube, IMO the round of BOV is godly.

1871,"As far as I know, if you go just parallel, you train only half travel of the joint, if you do ass to grass you spread the load throughout the whole travel.

You also want to be able to squat like Russians do, literally everybody today is so stiff that it hurts to squat, that is bad, squat (to the ground) is the most important human position, it speeds up your metabolism and stuff like that.

So basically you get more flexible. If you squat deep, you get much more gainz.


&gt;It might seem counter-intuitive, but the deeper you go in a squat, the increased knee stability you’ll experience. This is because there is increased contact between the back of the thigh and the calf, reducing the shearing forces on the ligaments within the knee. In fact, a 2013 study from Sports Medicine found that the highest compressive forces are placed on the knee when it is at a 90-degree flexion angle. Essentially, allowing the knee to move freely in a full range of motion helps to build tissue strength around the knee joint—not to mention decreasing the amount of stress (and therefore reducing the risk of injury) on the knee itself.

Right click taskbar again and lock your taskbar, should be in center. Unfortunately the new icons move only to the right (as if the taskbar started where your first icon is), so it can look quite off if you are messy, but it looks hella nice.

Right click taskbar -&gt; Customize, then cllick ""Select which icons appear on the taskbar"" and uncheck every single thing (they'll still be there, but they'll be under the arrow menu), go back and click ""Turn system icons on or off"" and uncheck all excluding Volume (you're likely to need that).

2383,"Is there any better alternative to the MEElectronics M6PROs? All IEMs I've ever tried didn't fit me, but all of them were just the ones that come with your phone, the mushroom tips etc, these seem to have sh*tloads of the tips (is that how you call the silicone/plastic ends that you insert in your ears?) so I figured that at least one has to fit me. 

I'm looking for very colorful music, lots of bass etc. fun to listen, don't need 100% accurate reference sound.

Just to be clear, here is it in the proper format.

* **Budget** - The price of M6PROs, which in my country (Czech Rep.) is 1600CZK, and that is exactly $66
* **Source** - Phone (Lenovo P70) and sometimes PC with MSI Z170A Gaming M3 motherboard.
* **Requirements for Isolation** - I don't mind some bleeding, but I figure that all IEMs are quite isolated, since you're playing them quiet.
* **Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** Mostly in bed (that's actually the reason for why I'm buying them, using my current Superlux HD681 EVOs is really uncomfortable in bed, the drivers are massive), but public as well, but again, I don't care much for isolation.
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** - IEMs as mentioned
* **Preferred tonal balance** - I'm not exactly basshead that cares only about bass, but I enjoy my music to sound very colorful.
* **Past headphones** - Corsair Vengeance 2100 (I actually stopped using them  since I got my HD681s almost completely, I  use them only for Skype/TS calls)
* **Preferred Music** - EDM - Deep House, Electro Swing, Trap/Liquid Trap (most of the time stuff like Flume- Tennis Courts, Flume - You &amp; Me, AREA-21 - Spaceships) but also a lot of rap.

Thanks for any help.

**TL;DR** - Do IEMs better than M6PROs for the same price exist?

2435,"Haha no he isn't taking notes.

In Rally, racers are driving unique tracks each year, therefore they don't know the right line which they should be driving. So before the official race, each team (pilot + copilot) goes slowly through the track and the copilot takes notes about the difficulty of turns, eg. Left 6 - Very unnoticable, almost straight turn, while Left 1 - very sharp, almost 90° turn, then for example Square left - That's 90° left turn, Hairpin left - That would be ""U"" shaped turn (it is 180° and pretty sharp, you need to be driving slow to take it without crashing) and then the craziest one is Acute, so for example acute left - That's basically a 140°, extra sharp turn.

Next are crests, jumps, bumps and other calls like ""Maybe"", ""don't cut"", ""tightens/opens into X"", long/short. Crests, jumps and bumps are all basically small, or big jumps, ""maybe"" signs that it's not 100% sure the crest, bump or jump will put you into air or not, ""don't cut"" means that there is some kind of barrier in the turn (the whole call usually goes like eg. Right 3 don't cut) that makes you unable to take the turn from the inside of the road. ""Tightens/Opens into X"" means that the turn progressively opens or tightens, it usually goes like eg. Left 5 tightens into 4, which means that at the start, the turn isn't that sharp, but as you progress into it, it starts to get tighter and you need to slow down accordingly. Long/short is just how long or short is the turn.


And last there are numbers in tens or hundreds before the call, eg. Sixty left five, that means that Left Five turn is coming in 60 meters

When they slowly go through the race, and the copilot has his notes ready, they can do official race where the copilot tells him how to drive it, here is a nice example where you can hear everything nicely - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxDz0Z066NI&amp;ab_channel=DukeVideo

The stuff that I didn't explain and is in the video is usually just personal preference of the driver where he has agreed with the copilot to do it that way",2016-04-15 12:54:20+00:00,d23wtws,2.0,t1_d23oxub,24512.0,AdrenalinePorn

It's just that when you are making it in eg. Instagram, you're already uploading .jpg photo file which has lost all the metadata, possibilities and functions of RAW image file, not to mention that most of this software will do most of the stuff for you, but poorly, making it pretty ugly.

Think of it as an not so beautiful woman putting on make-up to look beautiful, then you have naturally beautiful woman, they look almost the same, but the naturally beautiful woman will always be prettier, since make-up is not perfect, and even just the fact that you realize that the naturally beautiful woman looks better than the woman that is trying very hard to look like her makes you pick the natural one.

This picture is still one of the better examples, but there are often some landscape photos which are attempting the tilt-shift art, but in fact it's just person taking photo of the landscape, putting it into the image editor and slapping two blur bars above and under the spot they want focused. When you look at the image, you can certainly see where it gets instantly blurred, not looking natural at all (generally it would go slowly from sharp to blurry, because the blurred objects would go farther away from the focus point) and it ruins the photo IMO. 

[Here is what I'm talking about, look at that ugly mess](https://oliviazsebik.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/zsebikshutterspeed-17artificalblur.jpg), the picture is just pure tragedy, if the photographer left it as it was, there possibly would be some background blur, which would highlight the girl, this way he made her look like some creature from your worst nightmares.",2016-04-08 19:17:25+00:00,d1vavsb,5.0,t1_d1v88xk,3439.0,woahdude

first - we don't know what does OP mean by decent feature set, for someone decent feature set might be two x16 slots, M.2 slot, for someone it might be as many iGPU video slots as possible, stuff like RST12 etc.

It's very likely that OP will game, but nobody knows at the moment, he could be building a server.

second - There are motherboards like the B150 which basically carry most if not all of Z170 features (excluding the OC ofc) and still are just B150, yes, the chipsets of course tell you the limits and features of the motherboard, but there are some rare cases where B150 could have more features than Z170.",2016-04-07 12:43:50+00:00,d1tfw4n,3.0,t1_d1tfqjq,299.0,buildapc
2587,"Well, it still kind of depends, you could get the one /u/itailitai posted and basically it will still be as stable as say top of the line Z170, the thing is, for example how many GPU slots do you want? Do you need more than 2 DIMM (RAM) slots? Do you want M.2 Slot (for M.2 SSDs) or for example if you need a lot of USB slots. 

If you want the most basic one, get the one itailitai posted, it's good quality mobo, if you want something that's really good, but just below the Z170 borderline, I would recommend you the [MSI B150 Gaming M3](https://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-b150gamingm3), It has M.2 slot, plenty of fast USB slots, enough PCIE slots etc. It's basically Z170 without the ability to OC.

EDIT: To make it little bit simpler for you - If you are on really tight budget and just want to game, you can easily get the cheapest one as long as it's by Gigabyte, MSI, Asus, ASRock or EVGA (I don't know much about Biostar or how are they called, but I would avoid them, since they're not known and will have small support) and you'll be absolutely fine, just make sure they're the corresponding chipset (H110 for Skylake etc.)",2016-04-07 12:36:41+00:00,d1tfo62,1.0,t3_4dqr3p,1351.0,buildapc

Much better build.

If you're on tight budget, the newest generation CPUs aren't usually the best way to go. This CPU is the same, but cheaper. Also, Z170 is completely useless, you're getting locked CPU and Z170 is made for overclocking. 

The 750ti, while it's nice, you can fit much better 380 in and stay in the same price range.

You do not need 2TB, believe me. Also, the Barracudas  break a lot, WD Blue is better.

I managed to put in SSD, that speeds up your whole system and few games if you decide to put them in there.

The CX PSUs are bad, not for gaming at all, there are quite a few cases of people getting their whole PCs ruined because of these PSUs, the EVGA one is the most reliable bronze PSU you can get.",2016-04-02 21:31:19+00:00,d1ne0ga,1.0,t3_4d3dzq,374.0,buildapc

Nope, it rains most of the time, but not always.

Yes, I'm not sure where exactly, but it's some spot on the highway where from black night, it turns into almost sunset in matter of like 2 seconds.

That's totally fine, you're actually doing work yourself (reading reviews etc), which often doesn't happen.

With the different brands, there isn't really any significant difference, here's an useful list that I should probably patent, since I use it quite often hehe.

MSI - Best at overclocking, awesome customer support, pretty good cooling

XFX, EVGA (and in AMD's case not EVGA but Sapphire) - Best cooling out of all ones mentioned, overclock quite well (especially EVGA), customer support is very good as well (especially with EVGA), but XFX is often cheaper.

Gigabyte, ASUS - Loud, take a lot of power, support is pretty bad with ASUS, almost non existent with Gigabyte, don't overclock very well, don't cool very well, and are often the most expensive ones (ironically)

PowerColor - Don't know much about them, but cooling is decent, overclocking is average as well, customer support is ""meh"" from what I know, but are often the cheapest (at least in US)

But the differences are very minor, if you can get any of these mentioned for like $30 cheaper than the rest, then go for it.",2016-03-27 23:25:01+00:00,d1fqdxx,7.0,t1_d1fq3mc,514.0,buildapc

The wattage is not everything, it's the consistency of trails under different loads, the quality of capacitors (let's say for example Titanium rated 1500W Corsair which is also extremely expensive BTW has top notch Japanese capacitors, there's literally zero chance that it would kill your computer, whereas this PSU likely has some cheap, ultra low grade Chinese capacitors)

Yes, they do suck, I'm actually surprised it lasted you so long, I'd imagine it dying after about a year.

&gt; I wasn't going to bother putting a nice card in here as this was aimed to be Just a super cheap build.

Oh, in that case that's fine. Still, for Christ's sake please get better quality PSU, even the cheap EVGA 600B (by the way the G2 600W which is rated for 80+ gold and is super good quality is almost the same price now) will make your system more stable, and will make it much less possible for your PC to die because of the PSU.",2016-03-27 23:15:31+00:00,d1fq2iv,5.0,t1_d1fpuqk,389.0,buildapc

If it's just really minor mods like UI, or some model mods that aren't ultra high quality, it won't affect the performance really much.

2888,"Haha please don't tell me you bought locked Skylake CPU with Z170 motherboard or something lol.

The motherboard naming always goes like this (H/B/Q/Z), just the numbers change, say for Skylake (which is socket LGA 1151\*) you have 110-170, for Haswell (which is socket LGA 1150*)you had 81-97 et cetera. The newer the series of CPUs, the higher the numbers will be (unless Intel decides to make different naming)

\* - The number in the socket name (1151, 1150, 775 etc) stands for amount of pins on the CPU socket, for example [this is LGA 1151 (therefore Skylake) CPU slot, the little gold things there are the pins, there are 1151 of them in total](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Intel-LGA-1151-Socket.jpg), where on the other hand [this is LGA 1150 (therefore Haswell) CPU slot, it has 1150 of these pins, therefore 1 less than Skylake, it's not really useful, they do it only to divide individual motherboards](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Intel_Socket_1150_IMGP8593_smial_wp.jpg)

Now don't get me wrong, 1151 and 1150 aren't the only chipsets, but excluding Broadwell or Haswell-E (which are very high end CPUs, and  only few of them are in production) these are the newest ones, there are LGA 1155, LGA 775, LGA 1366, LGA 2011 (which is the Haswell-E socket, the Haswell-E CPUs are pretty big, that's why it has so much pins) and so on and so on.",2016-03-27 22:43:48+00:00,d1fp0cq,6.0,t1_d1fos3h,406.0,buildapc

If you plan on having 1 GPU, locked CPU build, you can actually just get the cheapest one that's by MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock, EVGA, or ASUS.",2016-03-27 22:34:45+00:00,d1fop92,1.0,t3_4c7hjd,890.0,buildapc

No... not it does not. any LGA 1151 motherboard will work, it can be any of these chipsets: H110, B150, Q150, H170, Q170 and Z170. It's useless to buy Z170 with locked CPU just by the way.

The 390 is a beast, even more in higher resolutions. It'll be able to run 1440p 144Hz in games like CSGO, or MOBAs, but definitely not in new titles. 

How much do you edit photos and do you do it professionally? While IPS panel's colors are nice, IMO spending extra 50 or even 100 dollars for IPS panel if you edit photos just for fun isn't justifiable. 

It highly depends, if you play competitive games, get 1080p 144Hz, if you want things to look nice, get 1440p 60Hz, if you can afford it, get Freesync 1440P 144hz IPS panel (wait does that even exist?), but don't expect every new game to run at the full potential of 144Hz (144fps).",2016-03-27 22:29:44+00:00,d1foj24,1.0,t3_4c7hwh,421.0,buildapc

Honestly I think this would be the cause, Xion makes pretty trash PSUs, it could likely be unstable at high load. I'd recommend getting the EVGA 600B or something like that.

Also, one protip - When did you update to the 550Ti? Because the 660Ti will be very similar performance. This is why I say that low end is actually more expensive than midrange. Let's say, saving a bit more and not updating so often, you could get maybe something like GTX 950/R9 370, maybe even 380, depends how much you manage to save and then have great performance and you won't need to update for a long time.",2016-03-27 22:25:22+00:00,d1fodqe,3.0,t1_d1fn7el,2072.0,buildapc

2895,"Nono, it's not bad, it is excessive, and spending more on GPU than CPU would grant you better performance.

One more question, do you really want the external HDD? Internal one would cost you much less and would likely perform better.

In case you don't, here's **MUCH** more powerful computer for $20 more. IMO 500GB SSD is little too much, but it highly depends on your usage and needs, if you want your games to load hella fast, you could potentially get even 1TB, if you'd use it only for OS and few basic programs, 120GB would be more than enough.

Better performance for less money, the PSU is way too big of an overkill, you were putting overclocking motherboard with locked CPU. The case is IMO waay too expensive, so I swapped it with IMO better looking S340, but if you really want it, feel free to. The R9 390 is better than GTX 970.

Get a nice mechanical keyboard for the rest or something.",2016-03-27 20:06:34+00:00,d1fjq0t,1.0,t3_4c6xzk,517.0,buildapc
2918,"So, you're getting Z170 motherboard with locked CPU, and unless you want to try the non-K skylake overclocking (not officially supported, carries some cons), then it's completely useless.

Next, you don't need cooler, the CPU comes with stock one.

Then, you don't need 2400MHz RAM since the CPU will still use only 2133MHz. Also, if you are going to game, 16GB is unnecessarily much

Next, switch the HDD for WD Blue one, the Barracuda fails often.

Then, I'd get different brand than PowerColor if I was you, they break quite often.

Other than that, seems fine. Also, you want to stay around $1100 CAD, don't forget that the RAM price didn't count in, which would be another at least $70 CAD, bringing you over $1200.

Here's what you could get for the same price, but better performance:

I put in only 1x8GB so when games start needing 16GB, you can just buy another stick, not whole another kit.

I managed to fit in R9 390 which is much better than the 380.

Swapped the PSU for this one since the EVGA is high quality and just enough for you. I also removed the optical drive which IMO you don't need at all (stuff doesn't really come on CDs today and you can install Windows with USB).

If I was you, I'd also add an SSD, for budget, Trion 150 is good choice, or some Kingston stuff (excluding the V300 SSDNow), the best thing you could probably get now is the Samsung 850 EVO.",2016-03-27 20:00:20+00:00,d1fjiqa,1.0,t3_4c6wl6,792.0,buildapc

Booom, like this.

You were getting unlocked CPU with motherboard that's impossible to overclock on. So I changed it for almost equal CPU, removed the cooler since one comes with the CPU (in case you want to get one later, I recommend Cryorig H7, if unavailable then the 212), I removed the thermal paste since that also already comes with it. Removed one stick of the RAM, since for gaming 8GB is all you need right now, when games start to need more, you can just buy the second stick. Removed the Barracuda (they fail a lot) and changed it with 1TB WD, I am pretty sure 1TB is more than you need. Changed the monitor for the Acer, they're basically equal (you could save even more if you didn't want IPS panel). Had money left so I put in SSD, since 2016 build is not a good build without SSD.",2016-03-26 19:54:12+00:00,d1egxx6,1.0,t3_4c2ju5,812.0,buildapc

2981,"&gt; No idea why reddit hasn't added a ""mod only"" flair system

Wait they don't? Always thought mods have their flairs or at least option to modify the flair to anything they want.

&gt;Also worth noting that I don't know if /u/V2Blast and /u/knightfader intended you to be able to add your own flair or not, I wasn't here when the flairs got added :P

I see, the ""SPOILERS"" flair would make sense, since it would be pretty bad if you had to contact admins for that.

But wouldn't this work?: Disable default users from assigning link flairs, but make automoderator (or whatever does this kind of stuff) to assign the for example SPOILERS flair if you put [SPOILERS] in front of your text? Something like in /r/Giftofgames; users aren't allowed to change flairs themselves, but when making a post, they have to use [GOG], [Offer], or [Request] and then automatically receive the flair.",2016-03-26 18:43:48+00:00,d1eejld,3.0,t1_d1eedti,281.0,needforspeed

Awesome, thanks!

&gt; There was supposed to be a Need for Speed logo in the banner that was clickable, however we had to remove it for this banner. Logo on top of the sidebar is supposed to be clickable, but its broken in Chrome apparently. Going to find a fix and add in another button in the header!

I see, I see, As hard as I try there's really no clickable field other than Snoo and ""Comments"" and ""View Images"". Thanks!

&gt; I disabled it to keep it short, more space for announcements. Might move the entire thing back to the banner, though, in which case I'll have more space to add it back.

Oh yeah, that'd definitely take some space for people with tens of thousands or even more karma (don't know if anyone here has over 100k). Also, the ""seems broken intentionally moved here"" should've been without the seems broken, I was looking for it in the upper right and didn't see it, so I thought you removed it by mistake or something haha.

&gt; Can't do much other than change the background color, but I can try to make it a bit better.

Cool, thanks again!

&gt; That's how I explained the rule I wanted to add when I first brought it up to the other mods haha, but I figured there would be a better way to word it

Oh, surely there is, just nothing came on my mind heh. 

&gt; Yeah V2 and Knight are much busier than I am. V2 also has a bunch of other subs he moderates, and I'm fairly sure knightfader is focusing on collage at the moment.

2991,"[Damn, the theme looks really good!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8c5wmeOL9o&amp;ab_channel=Dylancliff111)

I have few suggestions though!

The Live preview bar has dark grey text, on black background, almost impossible to read http://prntscr.com/akbhys

Please, please add a need for speed button somewhere in the header like it was before, the Snoo button takes us to the front page, can't get to this sub's front page other than erasing the /comments... in the URL bar.

The account overview bar in the top right is intentionally moved [here](http://prntscr.com/akbjql), right? I don't mind it, it looks very nice actually, but the link/comment karma overview is broken, it doesn't show up, might be because I use Reddit Enhancement Suite, but please make it RES friendly, many people use it

Relevant to the live preview bar being black, the editing tools are also black on black dark grey background, like this: http://prntscr.com/akbkd2 I mean it's not impossible to read, but takes some effort, if it would be possible to make the colors contrast more in here, it'd be great.

Other than that, I like it a lot! Can confirm that it works on both 1920x1080 and 1280x1024 displays without losing anything.

* Are you happy with our current set of rules?

Yes I am, but I would make the behaviour rules more strict (but that's mentioned lower), because the toxicity in this sub is pretty high, but I understand it, it's like this in most game related subs.

* Are there any rules you would like added?

Nothing else than the behaviour one

* Are there any rules you would like changed?

None

* As we're already enforcing it, we've considered adding a more specific rule against harassment, name calling and generally being really rude to other people. How would you word this rule?

Very happy that you're doing this. How I'd word it? ""Don't be a dick"" in bold, uppercase letters, lol

* Are you happy with the current moderation on this subreddit? Is there anything we could do different that would benefit the subreddit?

I'm honestly happy with how it is.

* Do you think we need more moderators?

Yes, I do. Now I don't want to sound rude, but so far I haven't really noticed anyone else than you really interacting with people in this subreddit, warning them etc. I don't know what's the role of the other two guys, they might do something very well, but not so visibly (resolving posts not showing up etc). So I think at least one more moderator that's based around warning people, telling them what not to do and so on like you do would be great. 

* Any other concerns?

3041,"**PerkTV** (although it has gone little bit downhill) or **AppTrailers** (although that needs you to click to start ad every let's say average 30 seconds). In Perk's case, you can run ads overnight, after each ad, you receive something like 1 perk point, 1000 perk points equals $1 which you can then exchange for gift cards, or for some Perk themed stuff like mug etc. There are also other kinds of points, which you can invest in giveaways only, basically the more of these points you put into the giveaway, the bigger chance you have to win the product.

AppTrailers is basically the same just right now it's more profitable, doesn't have giveaways and needs you to click on the ads for them to start playing (so you can use it in job if you do some sitting work).

Then there are stuff on computer, like **UsabilityHub** which I really like, basically if webdesigners have some dilemma (not knowing which font looks better, which design is more functional etc.) they pay UsabilityHub, tell them their dilemma and show them the options, UsabilityHub puts it up for users (testers) like me, and we then decide which design we like more, for each of these tests (some can take literally under five seconds, some need a little bit of thinking since they either want you to remember how the page looked and t hen give feedback, or tell them what would you like more on the page etc.) you get $.10, minimal payout is $20 which is rather big, but IMO it's actually fun to do these, so far I've accumulated $5, but if you have time and check it daily (and know many languages, but the highest majority is still in English), you can get to $5 in let's say week. When I started, I've been doing it all day for few days, but then stopped completely and just now remembered.

Then there are the classic surveys, which have the highest payout, but are also the most boring (at least for me). It's the classic ""On scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is not at all familiar, and 10 is very familiar rate how familiar are you with X brand"", next being how much do you like X brand and so on. Best sites for such stuff would be **Profilic Academic** or Pinecone Research, which is pretty hard to get into, since they're open phase based (they have a certain limit of users they can let in and certain time in which they take new users), but pay a lot of money.

Then there are product testing sites (for example **amzn review trader** I think it's called?) where they send you some stuff either for absolutely free (sometimes like $200 bad, not bad IMO) or give you some sale on the products which you then test and write a review on Amazon, but no, it's not like they pay you to give them 5 stars, they don't allow that, they want your honest review and want you to tell what you liked, didn't like.

If you can't get the temperatures while in-game, try some stress tool so you can see the temperatures under load. If anything exceeds 90 degrees celsius, there's a problem with heat.

GPUs indeed get better every generation, but it's not nearly close to ""huge"" performance jumps, they're very minor, but Polaris and Pascal could potentially be pretty big jump since it comes to new dye size, that happened in 2011 the last time.

4. Honestly it's mostly just the Chipset, if it's Z or X, you can overclock them if you have K processor, otherwise not, so if you're getting non K CPU, you can't overclock it (well, you can with Skylake but its long story). Other than that it's just the looks, size and if it supports SLI or Crossfire and how many ports does it have. So if you're aiming for cheapest possible, you can get cheapest motherboard that fits your CPU. 

5. Because it's Hella fucking cheap in there. 

6. That'd a port used for M.2 SSDs which are faster than regular SATA SSDs. You likely won't see the difference within normal use. 

7. OCZ Trion 100 or 150 would be my suggestion. Just do not buy Kingston V300. 

8. They're smaller hard drives that have no moving paets, therefore the read/write speeds are up to 10 times higher than with HDD. SSD doesn't really do much than speeding up stuff, you wouldn't see better FPS or anything, but your system will load in blink and the overall stability will be better.

3362,"No problem at all, it's fairly simple when you learn it, but getting into the computer stuff might be confusing, just remember that in games, GPU has the biggest effect, then comes the CPU, then comes the RAM, then comes the storage (purely for loading times), and just then comes the motherboard which has almost no effect at all.

But it still depends, if you have 2 GTX 980Tis and some old Phenom processor, obviously getting high end CPU would give much better and bigger performance boost than buying third GTX 980Ti haha. RAM also doesn't do much, really right now 8GB is all you'd need for gaming, but if you'd have high end GPU, high end CPU and like 2 or 4GB of ram, you'd get much better performance boost by getting more RAM rather than getting better CPU or GPU.

Motherboards are usually only upgraded when you want to buy processor from new line, or if you want to do SLI or Crossfire because some motherboards have only one PCIE x16 (GPU) slot.

Next is the PSU, which also barely affects performance, but you want to have good quality PSU so you don't kill your pricey hardware. 

Good parable would be having brutal 1000HP car with quad turbos, insane amount of power and speed, but having small, old and rusty brakes  that would make you kill yourself in the first turn, brakes = PSU",2016-03-21 14:26:11+00:00,d17un5h,13.0,t1_d17ugo2,308.0,buildapc

Getting better GPU would definitely be better, it won't help with the raw recording, but will help in games (and therefore easier for recording).

3365,"Yup, any better CPU would indeed new a new motherboard since the sockets won't be compatible.

3366,"&gt;So if I had the OS and my recording software on the SSD would it handle it a little better? 

Well if you mean saving the footage on SSD, then there would be no difference between HDD and SSD, HDD would be actually much better since pure video storing doesn't need the performance and you could get much bigger HDD for the price of smaller SSD so you could store more footage. But putting OS on it would surely help with the overall speeds and therefore even recording performance (although if you want better performance while recording, investing in better CPU would be better idea)

&gt;I'm imagining things far off in a game would load quicker meaning easier performance for the PC but I'm not sure exactly if it will help with performance rather than solely starting it up.

Well most games today don't have issue with the speed of loading textures (maybe the new NFS where people with slow hard drives were reporting falling through map, but that's about to be fixed soon), the biggest difference would be in sole loading screens, where when now with newer games you are waiting up to 30s (looking at you, Just Cause 3), with SSD you'd be looking more at around 5 seconds.",2016-03-21 13:13:15+00:00,d17sbw6,5.0,t1_d17s52m,419.0,buildapc

You could although get 1TB SSD for let's say $300 and store everything on in, including games which would load insanely faster.

The game itself wouldn't run at more FPS, but would increase the loading times, and honestly today's PC without SSD is IMO bad PC.

Swapped the CPU for an i3, since you want better GPU, not CPU. Then I swapped the SSD for Trion 100, the V300 SSDs are bad. Swapped the RAM for cheaper one, you can put back the Kingston if you feel like doing so (it's just 6 pounds more, so it's likely worth it for aesthetics), then I managed to fit in MSI R9 380, which will perform much, much better than the 750ti, I changed the case for nice S340, but if you want to, you can use the BitFenix, it's matter of looks, nothing else. And finally I swapped the PSU since CX PSUs are **not** for gaming, they often ""blow up"" the rest of the system, they're for office use, so I put in a better EVGA 600B.

So, you can save money on the case, and maybe if you want to, switch the RAM (although I would still recommend getting 1x8 so you can upgrade in the future, not having to buy whole new 2x8GB kit). You can also save money on getting cheaper R9 380 like for example the [XFX one](http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-video-card-r9380p4df5) for 20 pounds less, it's up to you, but don't buy the 2GB version.",2016-03-21 11:33:05+00:00,d17q44u,1.0,t3_4bbt9l,2161.0,buildapc

Swapped the CPU for 6500 since you're not going to overclock, so it'd be useless to pay more money for unlocked CPU. Added cooler that should be enough, if you can't find it where you live, even stock CPU should be fine. The motherboard is fine quality, then I switched the 970 for 390, the 390 outputs a little bit more heat, but not that much, and performs better. Then I swapped the PSU, please, I beg you do not use CV/CS/CX/RM/VS whatever, they're not made for gaming and could easily kill your whole computer. The one I posted is very high quality, so it might be poorly priced, in that case I'd just get EVGA 600B if you can find it.",2016-03-20 17:40:24+00:00,d16wap3,3.0,t1_d16vz3u,539.0,buildapc

I put in Skylake since it performs somewhat better, added much better cooler, quite high end overclocking mobo, very high end RAM, better and much bigger SSD and normal 1TB storage, switched the 970 for 390 since it's better. There isn't really much more to make this rig more beastly.

But in case you are serious with 1440p, you can even fit 980ti in that budget:

3444,"I've tried pCars, Assetto corsa, Automotion (rather simulator about building engines), Grid 2, Grid autosport, Dirt 3, Dirt 2, Dirt Rally, Live for speed, rFactor, iRacing, F1 2015, F1 2013, ETS, ATS. All these games are great expect some which I find mediocre, but they all lack what is the point of Forza (IMO) that's all the Godlike customization, all the engine swaps, weight reduction, you can modify the car to atoms, while in other today's games, you get Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 spec and sliders showing you how fast your car is out of ten, that's meh IMO.

The Apex indeed is slimmed down, apparently it might not even have the customization, that's worrying me. But I'll just wait for Horizon 3, I mean sure, I'd prefer Horizon 3 on PC rather than console, but first it might not even come, and second, in the meantime I'd be extremely impulsive to buy the XBone just for the other Forzas so I can play something before it eventually comes out.

i7 - waste for gaming unless very high end, mostly for rendering stuff

The 1x8 vs 2x4 difference would be tenths of FPS. This way it's better since first - you save costs on one module, and second - this mobo has only 2 ram slots,  so you can easily upgrade to 16GB when games start needing it not having to buy whole new kit = $$cost effective$$

I don't think so. 

https://m.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/3w44pj/sapphire_r9_390_overclock/

Almost everybody in this thread pushed it further than 1050 with ease. Average I'd say is 1125MHz, the 390 seems to benefit from this small looking overclock a lot. Of course nvidia clocks higher, they always did,  but if you want to start debate about why numbers don't matter at all in the computer world, please leave me out if it.

Division is optimized with nvidia, still losing, I hope that's enough.

Boom, cheaper, better performance, by getting the cheapest Z170 you are doing worse than  getting some decent H110/B150. If you want it so much, swap it for your loved Z170 board, but I'm telling you it won't make difference. ",2016-02-29 21:50:52+00:00,d0ikj3h,5.0,t1_d0ii3fj,3259.0,buildapc
3753,"Oh God, you are asking for advice and then still consider everything somebody says wrong. 

There is absolutely no difference you will notice between the B150 and Z170, it's just that Z170 can overclock unlocked processors which you aren't getting. So you are overpaying on useless stuff. I don't know if somebody told you, but the CPU clocks mean dogshit, look at AMD's 8 core 5GHz stuff which is not comparable to many 3GHz i3s. The instructions per cycle matter, not the clocks. So again, getting 6500 is overpaying.

And there we go, you saved enough to get R9 390 instead of 380 which will give you much more performance than if you got 6500 and Z170 board.

&gt; This means that **while** there are only two physical processors inside the CPU, **but** software **teats** it as if **there’s** four cores[5].

while -&gt; but - Either ""...while there are only... ...the software..."" or ""...means that there are only... ...but software...""

teats - treats

there’s - there is four cores - that's incorrect, ""there are four cores"" - that's correct

&gt; [1] Sorry AMD, you just don’t get into non custom built computers.

Absolutely untrue, you want to get 8 core AMD into budget rendering machine instead of Intel in the same price range. You also want AMD if you are overclocker, and you want AMD for extreme budget HTPC/office use. Gaming isn't the only thing computers are made for.

&gt; ...on Skylake CPU’s

Repeat with me - Apostrophe S to appropriate, S alone to pluralize,  CPUs don't own anything in this case, if you need to use an apostrophe, it would be Skylake's CPUs, while that still sounds weird since Skylake isn't genus viable. You used it wrong and correct many times combined, for example ""Wikipedia’s list"" is correct, the list belongs to Wikipedia, ""...rolling out some of the CPUs"" also correct, so I guess it was rather mistyping than lack of knowledge.

http://i.imgur.com/bN4QEu6.png

Too much ""and"", use comma, or some synonym that would fit there, particularly this paragraph itself has ""and"" 6 times in it, read it yourself, it will sound unnatural

&gt;Talking about the budget Skylake processors right now is going to be a bit weird as they’re still rolling out some of the CPUs[8]. The budget Intel processors can be split up into Pentium and Celeron. And the Celerons aren’t out yet (at least to be bought on their own). however the prices and specs have been announced so I can still talk about those. The Pentiums start at $64 and have two cores without hyperthreading. With the cheapest clocked in at 3.3 GHz. And the Celerons will also have 2 cores with no hyperthreading. And they will start at $42 clocked at 2.8 GHz

 For example,

&gt; The budget Intel processors can be split up into Pentium and Celeron. **And** the Celerons aren’t out yet.

Absolutely no need for the second ""and"" here, you could've written

&gt; The budget Intel processors can be split up into Pentium and Celeron. Unfortunately, the Celerons aren’t even out yet.

or

&gt; The budget Intel processors can be split up into Pentium and Celeron. Celerons aren't even out yet.

Or even


&gt; The budget Intel processors can be split up into Pentium and Celerons which aren't even out yet.

Making some sort of list or table would also be helpful, working as tl;dr at the end of the article or something, like this:



 | 
|
Pentium + Celeron | Low end
i3 | Low to mid-range
i5 | Mid-range to high-end
i7 | High-end hyperthreaded processors

Obviously not just like this, more into detail, but so you can understand what I mean.

Also, you didn't really talk about Intel CPUs as whole thing, rather about Skylake. There are many more suffixes and versions of CPUs, like X, C, R etc.

Don't understand this as some blame of your post, or anything, just a few things that would IMO make the article better, it already is pretty well written and was a good read.

Sapphire or XFX would probably be your best bet then, what color theme are you going for? Seems like solid black considering your other components, in that case, both XFX and Sapphire have all black models.

What is interesting is that 970 already had The Division driver, 390? Not yet, one more thing - the 970 was later beating it, but it's because it was overclocked, 390 was running stock. Other than that, stock to stock, AMD had better framerate and frametime most of the time.

The ""Runs best on X"" is rather advertising, many times you can also see ""Runs best on Alienware"" which is just bullshit. Sometimes you will see ""Runs best on AMD"", or something like that, which necessarily also doesn't have to be true, the game was developed using the brand's tools, that doesn't instantly make it perfect for the game.

Is that caused by the cable length? Or does the cable catch some interfering from all the stuff there (the power supply, monitors, other peripherals in the motherboard)? The sound should theoretically sound better from the back, since it's direct, not extended with cable.

I'd love Battlefield Bad Company 2 since I have many hours in BF1942, 1943, 2142, BF2, 3 and 4 combined, and many people say it's still the best Battlefield out of the series. 

Good strategy game? What about whole bundle? Current humble bundle has Civ V with DLCs which is itself very good, Civ IV, Civ III, Civ Beyond Earth (newest one), Pirates! XCom which is also great futuristic one, all for $15but 1 day left, so hurry up! If you have these or don't want them, then I'd recommend you The Settlers (mainly the older ones) or Heroes, I can't even explain how much fun I had with friends in these games in hot seat mode! 

All of the games will work flawlessly on 960 since it's still a good card.

Yup, I mean, if you already have enough money to spend on 6700 and are doing high-end rig or some intensive work, you likely could spend the extra few dollars on K version, but that might be wrong. I think the 6700T wouldn't be able to be OC'd to the K levels, AFAIK the T CPUs are overall made from worse silicone pieces, and throttled pretty hard.

4449,"Only Skylake, which is only the i7-6700 (at that point you seriously should consider the K version though). [Here's the list of all supported CPUs, but focus on the ""depending on your budget you should...."" list, because the other ones are just overclocked versions of X ](http://i.imgur.com/jHhgT0e.png)

Any Z170 board by ASUS, MSI, ASRock, Gigabyte, but you need to flash the correct BIOS, for that, I recommend you to study very carefully [these guides, depending on which board you have/will have](http://overclocking.guide/category/intel-oc-guides/skylake-non-k-oc/)

Now I know I said only Skylake, but that's not 100% true. In earlier architectures like Haswell etc. you could do it as well, what you do is increase the ""Baseclock"". With older architectures, baseclock (or BCLK) was tied to the motherboard, so if you pulleld it up even by 5MHz, you were basically overclocking almost everything in your PC (most noticeably hard drives) which caused in killing the hardware. 

In Skylake case, the BCLK is tied just to the processor, so you can OC that standalone without being worried about other components.

I recommend watching the below listed videos, the BCLK OC is well explained in them:

So yeah, the 4 threads could get utilized pretty well, I'm pretty sure that Civ V (I know your dad is playing IV, he might try the V though! It's fun ;D) can utilize 4 threads.

The motherboard can be any b85, the main potential of Z97 is that you can overclock the CPU, but you need to have K CPU (unlocked) and these are pretty expensive and not worth it in the lower-end. Basically, you can get the cheapest you can. [Asus B85M-G R2.0](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-b85mgr20) would be bang for the buck right now, as it is on pretty huge sale on Newegg right now.

The H100i GTX is indeed very good, AIO overall would be better solution. 240mm/280mm rads outperform the D14 by few celsious, but in this case, it would be much more, since all the air would be coming only out of the case, therefore not making any heat in the case and not needing any intake fan.

Here's what I would do - Get the Evolv ITX (we back bby) and get CM 280xl or the NZXT Kraken x60 (or better the X61, very similar, but kinda quieter), they are 280mm fans, you could take advantage of that in the Evolv. The x60/1 is slightly better, but fractions of Celsius, so I would just grab the cheaper one/ the one you more aesthetically appealing (which is hands down the NZXT, isn't it?)

There are cases like the Node 340 which have pretty good airflow, but AIO would still likely outperform that.

With overclocking, there is close to no risk as well today, the CPUs have safety elements which keep it from blowing up, just, when you open BIOS, don't bring the voltage up by big numbers. Bring up the clocks, when it stops to be stable, bring up the voltage by **a little bit**, then you can try more and more MHz. Note that  by bringing up the voltage, you raise the temperatures, but the R1 is badass motherfucker that should take you really far to the rooftop of air cooling/AIO Liquid cooling, custom waterloop is the next step.

I am unsure why have you chosen that expensive case, IMO all In-wins are overpriced. S340 is beautiful case.

Changed the PSU to fully modular and 50W greater.

the R9 390 is better than 970 and right now possibly the best 1080p card you can get.

Used the Z170 PRO GAMING instead of the non gaming one, get the non gaming one, I chose this one just because it was only about $5 more expensive while looking better and having some extra features.

At least as long as you are gaming, the last 4 cores stay basically untouched, and while AMD has much more interesting numbers, Intel has much, much better IPC (Instructions per cycle) and that's what really matters. For example i5-4460 crushes the 8350 pretty bad at the same price, only thing is that it's locked, but I doubt you'd be OCing much from the 8350 in such old Motherboard. 

Or you could go Sky**lake**, sure, it is more expensive considering you have to get DDR4 RAM, but future wise I think it's much more clever. Also, the i5-6400 is better than the i5-4460 and much better than the 8350 at same price CPU standalone. I am upgrading to i5-6400, 16GB DDR4 2133MHz, MSI B150 Gaming M3 coming from Phenom II X4 970, 8GB 1333MHz and MSI 760GM FX and needless to say, I'm excited like a kid at Disney Land.

5631,"For anyone possibly wondering how to make photo like this -

You know when you take a photo in low light without flash and it's all blurry? Yeah, that's because there isn't enough light coming in the sensor (the ""eye"" of the camera) and therefore, the shutter (think of it as gate in front of the sensor) has to stay open longer for enough light to accumulate in the sensor, but as you move the camera (unintentionally, just natural body movements such as shaky hands) different shades of the light come in the sensor, which are then processed in one big pile of light, that's how blurry image is done.

Now this, where the long shutter is intentional is basically the same, but it's not caused by low light, you usually close the aperture a little bit (circular ""gate"" with open spot in middle which you can enlarge or shrink on the lens, in front of sensor and shutter, so it goes like this Camera body (sensor&gt;shutter) &gt; Lens (aperture)) which reduces the amount of light that can get in the sensor at a time, that makes the shutter have to be open for longer time and boom you have artsy long exposure image. You also have to use tripod, otherwise it will be blurry as mentioned above.

Here are some nice examples often taking up to several hours of the shutter being open at a time, or rather in more images which are then edited in one image, because having the shutter open for very long periods could potentially damage the sensor

Same with resolution: low resolution (&lt;720p), normal (720p-1440p) and high resolution (1440p-4k or alternatively &gt;1440p). 

But still not really sure about the resolution, because if you basically had unlimited budget, you would go for the highest resolution possible as long as you have badass battery that can survive look good on such resolution.

AMD - Mustang/Camaro - Hella lot of power, but most of the time you just aren't capable of using it correctly, since it's so hard to handle it at full throttle.

Title does, indeed, thought you were referring to my reply.

&gt;If you follow Bazoš/Aukro, BWs pop up around a half of that price. I still don't consider it a good deal, precisely because of limited modding options.

Excluding keycaps, what do you consider limited modding options if there's anything? I just ordered vinyl wrap to make it more personalized and to get rid of the (although brushed) plastic that leaves fingerprints. I am also thinking about modifying the Razer logo (making another cut-out for the LEDs so I won't be ashamed of the snake orgies.

&gt;…and if you care, G80s can be had for the price brand new, provided you can find a German proxy.

 Pretty good if you ask me, it's 4 points a day, if you get 30 referrals you get golden membership which doubles your points you get, so you get 8 points per day, so theoretically $20 Amazon/Steam gift card every 10 days (they are 75 points), 20 days with regular membership, and IMO, that's hands down amazing + shipping is free AFAIK and yes, they obviously do ship in CZE haha.

&gt;Also it's only competitive if the only opponent is a human

That's exactly what I wrote, any game that offers some kind of challenge against other players is competitive. 

&gt;have millions with 4 garages and go around in passive mode so no it's not competitive.

Do 4 garages offer some kind of competitive advantage? Does level 250 offer some advantage? Do millions offer some advantage? Maybe more guns, but at the end of the day, everybody uses AK, stickies or MSMG which are available very early in the game and are affordable. 

You have the option of passive if you don't want to fight, but that doesn't make it non-competitive, you have custom games in LoL, CoD and so on where people don't compete as well and instead have fun doing some shit. 

So again, yes, it is competitive (considering the downvotes you can see that people agree with me), basically any multiplayer game is competitive. Doesn't matter if it's NFS, WoW, Guild Wars, CSGO, Payday, Rocket League, Sniper Elite V2 (Yeah, you have an option to fight with teammates against AI, which again is competitive, you get score for doing so and can compete with other duos trying to beat your and your friend's score) ",2015-10-25 11:38:45+00:00,cwc2sxx,7.0,t1_cwc1pyy,5091.0,GrandTheftAutoV

Great to know that this mobo is capable of FX, I was slightly suspecting it, but wasn't certainly sure. 

Just in case if no better intel is found - What do you think about FX-8350? From what I've gathered it should be capable, but some guy on some forum said that my mobo can't supply 125w CPUs, but my **overclocked** 970 runs without any crashes. With stock settings, it runs at 125W and I've OCed it from 3.5GHz to about 3.75GHz and it still runs fine. 970 at 4.1GHz runs at 177W, so I guess it runs at about 135W-150W at my current settings.

6122,"Hey! 

1) It's not degrading the phone performance at all, there are like 4 apps which you notice. Possibly the worst is somek kind of Antivirus which checks anything you download, but you can disable it, then there is ShareIt and something similar which doesn't wake the phone, so the only thing it does is one additional icon in the menu. These apps are also very compact, in total under 10MB. 

2) The camera really is pretty bad for 13mpx, you need lots of light for the photo to be sharp. I've posted some other photos in daylight in this thread, and these are IMO pretty good. I'd say it's fine for phone until you are trying to capture detail. 

Even then I recommend rooting and removing the bloatware with Titanium Backup just for the sake of cleaning the phone, then I installed Root Booster and boosted the phone's performance with about 3000 in AnTuTu being on par with Note3 atm, and that's pretty freaking good for $200 phone. 

Oh and the battery is absolute beast, lasting 3+ days in normal use.

6181,"Razer Blackwidow - Unless 2013 or older has ""Razer switches"" which are rebranded Kailh switches, they tend to break faster. Razer Synapse is a God damn nightmare and there are problems with the build quality as well - **not bang for a buck**

CM Storm - Cherry MX switches, AFAIK the software is prety good. Build quality is apparently awesome, it is highly friendly to modification since the simple shape of body. Has non-standard bottom row, meaning that if you want to get some custom set, you might have issues with finding correct space key - **bang for a buck**

With the different versions, they all are very similar in terms of price, so it's just up to you, do you want full size (arrows + numpad), TK (arrows built in numpad) or TKL (only arrows). for backlighting, you are going to pay a little bit more, which is obvious, but it's not much. So, I know that you stated you don't care about size, but here it's rather about you having the option to be spoiled and picky.

6604,"With the mid, it is just part of the map, parts of the map are called calls and they are different in every map, most maps have mid, which is place somewhere in the middle of the map where lots of fights happen. There is also short, long, car, blue, even ""dildo"" (big pillar on de_overpass that provides big cover) and much much more. It takes pretty long time to learn all the calls but once you know them, it will really help you, since when you die, you can tell your teammate the exact position of the enemy so he can prepare for it. 

Kevlar and helmet is armor, you get slightly less damage if you buy them, but it is really game changing. 

Five Seven and Tec9 are just two of many pistols in the game, as CT, you start with either P2000, or USP-S (silenced pistol), as T you start with Glock. 

It is hard to explain the game just in a comment since it is very complex, I recommend you watching videos by professional gamers, or YouTubers such as BananaGaming, 3kliksphilip etc, there are lots of complete newbie guides. 

Also, I would be more than happy to help you in-game, in case you accept that, add me on steam: uTukan (avatar is dark samurai warrior in fog) I am in CET +1 and I'm student, I should be at computer in about 16 hours from now.

Mildly roasted, so you can see some darker spots, but not that it's extremely crispy, just that it has some crisp on the surface.

Meanwhile the toasts are roasting, I get my favourite cup. I put one tea bag of black Mohammad Earl Grey in it, start boiling water, when the water is done boiling, I pour it in the cup, I leach (sorry if that's not the correct word) it for about 3 minutes. Then I remove the tea bag, put one teaspoon of honey/two teaspoons of sugar in it. I fill the cup only to about a half, the rest I finish with milk.

Second, the shoe thang - am I fitting in the statistics?

Third - Yeah, it is Razer keyboard, I know that Razer doesn't reach the best quality, but this is the 2013 version which still has Cherry MX key switches (in this case, MX Blues obviously)

Now what I am planning to do with the keyboard in future:

Keycaps - I want to get blank keycaps, preferably [these](http://www.banggood.com/POM-87-Set-Blank-Key-Caps-Black-Keycaps-For-Cherry-MX-Keyboard-p-84081.html) ones, but they are out of stock all the time

Braiding the (already braided just for lulz) cable - I will probably buy two colors of the ultrathin paracord and make it nice. The colors will probably be blue (uh oh) and black.


Plasti dipping - Not sure, but I might plasti-dip it in the future, I just don't know which color, white won't fit my set up at all, blue would be too... childish (?)...

Making my own wrist rest, something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/zW7Ofmj.jpg), dad's a pretty experienced woodcutter, so it might be fun.

Is there anything you would recommend me to do? I am not entirely new, hell I am actually following the mechanical keyboard scene for a year and something, but just today I got my first board and don't really know some protips. Thanks!

Also, my feelings about the stuff we all love here:

6876,"1. Why the net_graph? It would look much better without it

2. You might want to do some custom viewmodel with replay commands such as cs_fov_debug

3. Some color correction would also be nice.

4. Rather than speeding up the boring part, which looks pretty comic, I would rather cut it and make transition straight from kill A to kill B.

5. I would remove the text in the beginning, it looks too cartoonish, we can already see the clip's name in the video title as well

6. I would cut the first few seconds (20-25) so there isn't 10 seconds of the player just hiding doing close to nothing. The last ~5 seconds weren't needed as well.

6. Custom killnotice, you can see these in most of frags, showing only your kills, not other, for the viewer useless kill notices, with some nice font and great contrast colours

Otherwise, the raw clip was pretty good, but it would be even better if the pit flickshot would be the last dude, making you win the round and just playing the ""Terrorists win""

_______

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o824r2DX_es) is example of an edit I find absolutely perfect, the audio sync with the music is 100%, it has nice, pleasant yet cool CC, the transitions are either nicely fit in the clip, or they're just raw, without any effects and even then it looks good. The clip has great viewmodel, especially the cs_fov_debug x which you can take advantage of in the GOTV.

Of course you have only one clip, so there isn't place for so many effects, but I hope you can take it as inspiration. Nobody minds very high in-game settings with motion blur.",2015-09-11 15:18:12+00:00,cuxzb4b,1.0,t3_3kig9l,30866.0,GlobalOffensive

There are ""spies"" which manage to get in these groups, buy the hacks and report it to the game developer.

There are true 5.1/7.1 headsets, but they cost around $300 in which case, it's again better to get stereo headphones because the sound will be much clearer. Many people think that ""gaming headphones"" have sound made for better hearing of footsteps, which is just bullshit. One of few acceptable ""gaming headsets"" is Sennheiser G4me Zero, but $200.

Now I don't mean to sound rude, you might just prefer these older versions of the game, but possibilities are that you can't run GTAIV or V, in that case, there is really low possibility that you could run any of these mods. 

If it's the other case, and you just prefer the older titles - There are versions of ENB or iCE for SA, not sure about 3 and VC (but possibly yes). 

Don't expect it to look like this though, the best you could get would probably look like GTA V on ultra low. The games just don't have the potential to look *that* great.

Author also used mod that modifies handling of the cars (you can see the GTR being slippery) but that has nothing to do with graphics, only adds to realism. I think it is called ""ultra realistic handling mod""

7203,"1. The favorites, and possibly-in-final are fnatic vs TSM/EnVyUs/maybe NiP (although they seem pretty inconsistent). Don't have much info on the other ones.

2. If you die, you lose all weapons (excluding pistols, if you have default one - P2000/USP, Glock), grenades, kits, but you keep the money and get some more at the end of the round.

3. It depends, if the wall is thin enough, you can spray it with almost any weapon, although if it's 20cm concrete wall, it's either un-wallbangable or it deals very low damage, there are lots of videos on common fullout spots which you cna spray through and maybe get some lucky kill.

4. Well, it's not only ot have the best weapon you can get, it's often better to don't buy on round where you could buy MP9 and go eco (pistols only, no buy) and save for second round, where you could afford some rifle (AWP, M4/AK). But force buys happen, that's when the situation is critical and the team has to try and buy the best guns they can, even when their economy is low

5. Yes, there are 6 roles (it's weird when there are only 5 players in team, but different combinations happen)

 IGL (in-game leader) 

Entry fragger (the one who goes first)

AWPer - The sniper guy

Support - Usually knows lots of smoke/flashbang spots, supports his team and is not often topfragging (being first in the scoreboard, or overally having high kill count)

Lurker - The guy who tries to get enemies from behind, he plays on his own, often leaves his team, just to get in enemy's back and surprise him.

Rifler - Basically AWPer with rifles (AK, M4) possibly one of the most standard roles

The entries are very close ot each ohter. Then, I think it will be perfect and people would appreciate it :)

Hello, I am currently having Corsair Vengeance 2100 (please don't kill me) and I am about to buy Superlux HD681 EVO mainly for listening on phone, but I am curious if these headphones would serve me better in gaming? More specifically I mean hearing enemy footsteps, guessing where the enemy is et cetera in CS:GO. 681's are Half-Open and Open headphones have better soundstage meaning taht they provide you with better sound visualization, can I notice it with these headphones? 

If 681 EVO's aren't that good for gaming, I was also thinking about 668, 668B, 330, and basically anything from Superlux or Samson in this price range, are any of them better? The price of Evo's is the most I would like to spend (yes, I know, my budget is pretty tight). I don't need closed headphones since I mostly listen at home and neither I am any kind of basshead window-rattler.

Thanks for any tips! If I was able to, I would buy Sennheiser HD 598's, but the price is too much.

* Budget - The price of EVO's (around $40)

* Source - Samsung Galaxy S3 / Asus Zenfone 3

* Requirements for isolation - None, open would be possibly better

* Preferred type of headphone - Over ear

* Past Headphones - Corsair Vengeance 2100, Creative Fatal1ty (I am so, so sorry)

* Preferred Music - Doesn't really matter since I would mostly use them for gaming, but mostly Melodic EDM/Trap

* Additional info - Doesn't have to have removable cord, sound mixer on cord, or any of these fancy features, if the quality was better instead of these details, it would be optimal.

If you have stereo headphones and SC capable of SS, nothing will happen AFAIK other than the sound boost and better sound quality, you will still playback only stereo, since the headphones don't have surround architecture. If you turn off SS in your headphones and tun on SS on your SC, it possibly would be better quality surround. However with sound cards/amps, someone more experienced should help you.

At the end of the day, you can order it, try it out and if you don't like it, send it back in 14 days with full coverage until you live somewhere with brutal shipping taxes and CLO, which shouldn't be problem in Canada as far as I am concerned.",2015-08-08 14:56:12+00:00,ctvxq2q,6.0,t1_ctvxi2o,509.0,headphones

I think it's just about getting used to it, you can switch slowly, if you have the possibility, first go down to 5.1, set your EQ to some tad flatter pattern, after some time, make it flatter again, then switch to your primarily used EQ settings and switch to Stereo, you should be fine :)

7442,"1. Recruit is like level, Valve introduced this to manage smurfs and kind of push them away, you can play competitive from rank 3. It looks like this - http://i.imgur.com/ar0zmrC.png Private is the level, GNM is the competitive rank. You level up rank (Private) by playing any games on official servers - Deathmatches, Casuals et cetera. You rank up competitive rank only by playing competitive, you also have to play 10 competitive games before getting your first rank, it isn't like you start at Silver 1 and then progress up, for skilled people, this would be big advantage in beginning games, so if they play good for their first 10 games, they could get to for example AK (Master Guardian) 

2. It depends on your score, if you are sure it was over 30 matches, you are probably low in the scoreboard, but 30 seems too much, are you sure it was 30 matches on official servers? Leveling up to lvl 3 takes maximally 6 hours, about 15 games

3. You can either buy them (most of them, excluding these which are new or have percentage for pricey items in them) for 0.03$, or get them in-game randomly, otherwise there isn't any ""method"" to get the most cases.",2015-07-23 22:18:30+00:00,ctdwdu3,2.0,t1_ctdvpgj,1087.0,GlobalOffensive

Third - Now thinking about it, the toucan fits there nicely, but actually could it have some basic coloring?

7497,"Hey and thanks for what you are doing! 

My name is uTukan, or outside, in the real word, they call me Matěj, I come from the Czech Republic, more exactly from North-Western part where the mountains are. I am 15 year old student (Yes, I know, I am a youngster) who loves gaming for a really long time. I don't really know how to compose this in to the text so here are things that I enjoy!: It's gaming (obviously), **biking, swimming** (I have done both of these competitively in the past), flipping  butterfly knives and also betting CSGO skins on csgolounge.com (which if I win, will make sure not to do with your skin, because of the, should I say memory value? Yes, that's probably it. 

Anyways, I am hoping to win a CSGO skins since I started getting back to it and playing a lot recently (have the game since October 2013 where I only bhopped and surfed without playing any competitive matches, oh how silly I was) and so far I have 620 hours and counting. I bet a lot on csgolounge, but low-end skins, the biggest value skin I have ever bet was USP Guardian ST MW ($2.00) and it got back to me with some 0.80$ skin. I recently bet 0.24$ (IIRC) value on F3 when F3 vs NiP (don't take me wrong, I love NiP from the bottom of my heart) at 9:91 odds and I won AWP | Worm God with Dreamhack and fnatic sticker, Pro90 Pulse and some more skins, I was so lucky, if I went all in, I would get about $39, but betting on F3 was rather a joke, and it turned out good!

Hope I didn't bore you with my CSGO talk, but if you actually want to read more about me, [here is my intro thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/38etd8/intro_hey_gog_names_utukan_and_i_am_kind_of_new/)

[Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/utukan) 

If I would like to win CSGO skin, should I answer the same question, only with ""skin"" instead of ""game""? I will just do both if you don't mind.

* **What game do you want from Steam? Why do you want it? Why can't you get it yourself? (for that question, answers such as ""I spent all my only on [item] are ok."") Why does it interest you?**

If I actually win, I would love Rocket League.

The game just looks good and everybody said that when they bought it, it was even better. It might look like silly game, but all the fun it possibly holds is uncontrollable. I know a lot of streamers which were really skeptic when people told them to buy it, but when they finally did, they played it for about 12 hours straight! 

Why can't I get it myself? Because all of my (I get it, my parents money who gave it to me) money got spend on a new balisong/butterfly knife, since the first one I ever had, I didn't know a think about them, I just wanted to flip and I bought the wiggliest one you can ever purchase. I am now finally happy flipping!


* **What *skin* do you want from Steam? Why do you want it? Why can't you get it yourself? (for that question, answers such as ""I spent all my only on [item] are ok."") Why does it interest you?**

It doesn't really matter which skin, it's really up to you, you can check my inventory and see the skins I have. If you want to, of course it can be skin for weapon I already have in skin. 

Hint: My favorite guns in order from best to not-so best: M4A1-S, AWP, AK-47, 

Hint 2: I like the looks of kind of futuristic looking skins, such as Hyper Beast, Asiimov (not saying you should get me some of these, they are pretty damn expensive haha) Evil Daimyo, Redline, Elite Build, Dragon King and so on, I hope it gave you at least some idea. 

Hint 3: I don't really like the looks of these really worn guns (not as BS or WW cond. but as the official skin), or these extremely colorful guns such as Cartel, Boreal Forest, X-ray, Bright Water et cetera. Other points, I guess are the same as the first version with Rocket League.


Once again, thanks for what you're doing and congratulations for the wins in CSGOJackpot, the amount of money that gets dropped there is insane.

EDIT: If I somehow win, which would be extremely awesome, it will be next Friday, right? And I am not exactly sure if I will have access to internet, since I am leaving to Slovakia and then to Hungary, it should be on Saturday, but damn I am not sure! So in advance, I am extremely sorry if I won't respond, but you better know that I would be happy even if I coudn't answer!

EDIT2: Nevermind, I'm here until Saturday/Sunday afternoon :)

EDIT3: I decided that I literally have to have Rocket League and dug in to couch to find some spare money, did some little job, cashed out my /r/beermoney and found out that I can afford it! So if by any chance steam game choice falls on me, feel free to skip me and make another person happy :)",2015-07-17 09:12:23+00:00,ct6dpol,1.0,t3_3dkdsq,33789.0,GiftofGames

Looking at your request, I am glad that you actually took some time to explain in detail why you want the game, most new (including me, when I did my first request 6 months ago) users tend to write short little story of why they want the game that takes something around 5-10 lines and one paragraph haha.

If I don't win giveaway for something I really want, I am kind of OK with that, I just think that without GoG, I wouldn't have even the slightest chance and I am thankful for the person making other person's day better, even if it's not me.

I haven't really heard about the controversy around Po, but damn these people ale silly, I mean, most of them joined the giveaway and when they didn't win, they started shitstorm about someone trying his luck to win XBone? What the hell, they did the exactly same thing. Enjoy the hell out of your XBone Po!

Other than these 3 word entries such as ""pls gib gaem"" or ""I like X, I would play it with friends, thanks"" is possibly the only saltiness I am experiencing here and I tend to just ignore these people, most of the time, they get banned, so what. Other toxicity is possibly people requesting games and then not playing them. I know that most of the giveaways I made were for small indie games, but when I use the ""Pick a number"" system and then someone wins without even installing the game, I feel bad, because somewhere in there could be one person, which guessed number far, far away, but would play the hell of the game. In my next giveaways, I will make sure not to include the ""Pick a number"" system, but something more creative, from what you can really see the person's enthusiasm for the prize. Something like the Scavenger hunt, which, well didn't go really well, but I am sure you get my point.

Good luck Nuri, I am sure that you **will** get the Guild Wars 2 one nice day. 8 requests is something not a lot people would be willing to do. I get that you feel it's unfair when there is some guy requesting GTA V with some lazy-ass request and somehow getting the game, but that's unfortunately luck, sometimes it's on your side, sometimes it isn't. But heads up, continue to bring forth your positivity, there are lots of things we can be happy about, if you don't think so, hit me up and I will at least try to make your day happier.

With GomezPeer you will make very close to no money since it takes so long until they accept you and then so long to actually get in the main group, talking about months, or even about a year. eBesucher gets you verified close to instantly, but with correct setups (Java pop-up blocker in Firefox etc) you will make like 0.03$ a week whilst running 24/7. Other option is to run multiple sites such as eBesucher. But that still pays very, very low money. There are also sites where for watching ads such as in eBesucher you earn ""minutes"" these minutes you can trade in for getting your ads in the circle, there are sites (can't recall any right now) where you register and you get link full of non-pop-up ads, which you then trade in for the minutes and get money, but for running this software and having ads shown for like 3 days straight, I was at $0.005.",2015-06-28 17:48:44+00:00,cslk9bm,2.0,t1_cslg9mm,8576.0,beermoney

One time you wake up to a beautiful, yet rainy day in your beautiful flat. You come up to the kitchen, take your cereals, bowl and spoon, proceed to go to your dining table which is next to a window, you open your bag of cereals and find a letter inside it, at first you think it's one of these classic toys, but no, it is handwritten ""I know who you are"". You start panicking, yet trying to calm yourself down by thinking that it's just a prank by the cereal company, with a corner of your eye, you look out of the window to the roof of condo next to your and see person looking at your eyes, you have no clue who it is, yet you feel instant chills. The person then quickly runs away. I would love to see this.

#II.

There is a man living in household his totally normal life with a loving wife and two kids. He works in office, and as the time goes, he starts being much more stressed by his job until one day, he decides to quit his job, seek his weapon seller friends, and from all funds in his account he buys weapons and weapon equipment. He leaves about 40k$ out and then calls a hitman on himself. He leaves the city without any step behind him and plays cat and mouse with the hitman. The hitman doesn't know that the person he is chasing is the same person that pulled a hitman on himself. The person's goal is to kill the hitman, but not just kill him, play with him a little bit by using his equipment, for example tracking his vehicle.
