On the other hand the 681s have large soundstage and you can hear sounds you couldn't with the 2100.

**Your level of experience with cycling**

I've been cycling since I was born, I'd say I am quite experienced driver, even in offroad scenarios

**What's your price range, and have you considered second hand?**

I honestly have no clue what the budget should be, I guess wanting full suspension MTB for $800 is too optimistic, right?

I have considered second and, hell, I would prefer it if it could get me better bike, I don't really care about new ~~car~~ bike smell.

**What's your intention with the bike - commuting, fitness, touring, sport, etc?**

As mentioned above, offroad, having fun, sport (but not competitive level ^yet)

**How far will you be riding, and how often?**

I'd say about 5-30km per trip. At least 3 times a week

**Riding conditions: roads, pavement, trails, single-track, off-road? Flat or hilly? Traffic and weather.**

I won't be driving this only in the woods, sometimes I'd of course drive it on the road, but that would be just to get somewhere, not to be abnormally fast or something. So, I guess offroad gets 90%, 10% for road.

**Your location (even approximate) can help other locals familiar with your conditions, too.**

Northwestern Czech Republic, basically in the mountains.

I really have no clue what to get, I know a person that knows a lot about bikes, I'll ask them about it, but for now I'd like to know what would you recommend me.

I'll try it in AWD which is unfortunately like 100kg heavier.

Then she said she just bruises a lot and fell over.

Then she mentioned the sad story few more times.

Then her mother said they bruise easily and that she fell in park and changed topic to her hair and why she wears hats, why?! Her mother also acted really, really weird.

I have no clue what the fuck is going on. But something is, she acts COMPLETELY different than in her older videos, and that's not ""because I changed"", I had no clue who she is 48hours ago, but when I check videos from like 5 months ago and the latest video, she acts totally different, very unnatural, just repeating stuff over and over again.

I don't believe that she is kidnapped or any of that (but I do admit that at first I was really worried and been frequently checking the #savemarinajoyce on IG. Though, I do think that she is on drugs. [I mean look at 13:01 in DeFranco's video](https://youtu.be/vYj8YsfhYBA?t=781), she literally doesn't know what to do with her hands, scratching, I understand that, doing the heart symbol, that's fine, she does it a lot but after she does it her hands are just awkwardly there, then she runs her hair with one hand and the second hand is still just weirdly sitting there.

She also keeps repeating the same bunch of words/sentences. The yesterday's streams, this video, she keeps repeating same sentences sentences (I really love you, I really care about my fans, I don't take drugs, I promise you that I promise you that I promise you that I........). There is no kind of emotion in her, she smiles and then she looks almost death pale next to the camera. She has big eyes, I get that, but her eyes instantly become two times bigger each time she looks somewhere next to the camera.

I don't want to sound rude, maybe she's really in fact just changing, but I feel like something is definitely wrong with her.﻿

I feel like someone should do interview with her and do it a little more rough, Phil had few good questions, but he was kind, didn't want to sound rude, so he didn't say anything when she basically didn't answer the question or answered something completely different. Somebody should just ask her questions and demand answers.

At the end of the day she might be absolutely fine, drug-free and the person would end up looking like a huge douchebag.

EDIT: Or obviously, it's very likely that she's just going through tough time, maybe some family issues which led to depression. Maybe some mental issues.

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

The PC is (or seems to be) running fine, I have the FSP (or Fortron, depends where you live) Hyper S 700W and until now I thought the HDD is doing the sound, like it's vibrating in the cage or something, but now I found out the sound comes from the PSU, should I be worried?


**Post relevant photos of build/parts here.**

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I'd provide audio sample, unfortunately the only way I could record it is phone and microphone, neither of them are good quality enough for the sound to be recognized, all that can be heard is just the air noise.

Also note that it doesn't matter if it's under load or idle, although the longer the PC is on, the louder it usually gets

The sound isn't really something like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH-7-JF24lY&amp;ab_channel=HardCore), it's rather like humming being constantly interrupted really quickly (I'd say 10 times a second at least) with quite high pitched, but not very loud tick

I have tried googling this, but everybody has the clicking as in the video upper, and that's usually caused by the fan, this doesn't sound like it's coming from the fan, it's happening since I got the PSU which is little over year now (as far as I remember) and it's not caused by it not being tightened or something, the PSU has been moved between two cases.

So, is it really possibly the fan, or should I be worried and replace the PSU?",buildapc,Is it normal that my PSU is doing a clicky sound? (sample in thread),https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4bbxyw/is_it_normal_that_my_psu_is_doing_a_clicky_sound/

Other side, left is BH, right is SH.

Other side of the first picture, top is safe handle, bottom is bite handle. 

So I assume that it's really caused by the thick washers, but is the misaligned end of the handles also caused by them? I'd understand if the washer was thicker on one side (of the handle) , so it would be leaning that way, yet they are the same (on the single handle, but thicker than both in the other handle). Maybe it has something to do with the pressure?

Could I somehow sandpaper the washers down? I already tried it, but fitting the washers back in is pain in the ass so i did it only in the edges with quite smooth sandpaper, therefore it didn't affect anything. 

Or maybe I should just get new washers, all if the same size?

Write me a 1000-5000 symbol (if it's little bit over or under, it doesn't matter) prompt about retrofuturism, you know, the stuff we see in Fallout, just how people imagined the future to look like in 50's

**ALTERNATIVELY** you can do the same (drawing, writing) with theme of dark cyberpunk, not the Japanese stuff, but like  how would The Internet protests against the government because of SOPA/PIPA. This kind of stuff.

How big of an upgrade is the i5 4460 from the Phenom?

Is the i5 4460 the best CPU I can get for under $200? I was thinking about these:

FX-8350 - Interesting numbers, but actually pretty bad for the price

FX-8320 - 8350 with lower clocks

FX-6300 - Basically no upgrade

Xeons - I know absolutely nothing about them, just that some are better performing in rendering machines rather than gaming PCs

Ignore the overall price, most of these things aren't even sold anymore.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

So, my idea is to upgrade CPU and MOBO (I'm not sure if MOBO upgrade is needed, this mATX boy might be capable of it) and I can't really decide, I probably want to stay with AMD, since I know close to nothing about Intel, but if you know about some Intel that might float my boat, is better than my current build and meets my budget then feel free to post it as well.

New Motherboard - MSI 970A-G43

New CPU - AMD FX-Series X8 FX-8300

Or - AMD FX-Series X6 FX-6300

Or - AMD FX-Series X6 FX-6350

Is the 6350 so much better to be worth additional $25?

I don't know if the X8 is clever idea, it has pretty low specs and seems that I'd be paying just for the 8-core, I heard that jump from quad-core to hexa-core is pretty awesome, but the jump from hexa-core to octa-core is close to unnoticeable.

If all of these CPUs are crap, please suggest me something else.

**Reason of upgrade**

Old quad-core isn't holding it anymore, high temps, not so good fps etc

      Question - Yes - leads to another Q
                        \No - Leads to another different Q

Would you be interested in this? I would make it myself, just post here asking you what to add/change.

Example 


     (First branch) Do you like bump?  - Yes - Do you mind noise? - No - Cherry MX Blue

     (Second branch) Do you like bump? - No - Do you mind noise? - Yes - Cherry MX Black

Both branches will start in the same point - Do you like bump? And then divide in to separate branches depending on the answer.

There would be lots of trees, what I mentioned above would be like 1. Switches

Then, next to it will be 2. Layout etc etc

So basically I want to ask you for name of actor/character and movie/game in which this guy played/appeared in, here is the description as how he always appeared:
_______
Male

24-32 years old

Black

Always (IIRC) appeared without shirt

Not ripped, neither totally skinny, just average lean

Was probably part of some Guerrilla warfare in jungles

Had no beard, neither long hair, maybe bald (I think not.)

Always (IIRC again) appeared with AK-47/AK-74SU (with the folding stock, the short version)

Wore brown shaded aviator glasses

Wore camo/khaki shorts/cargos to knees

Sometimes (not sure) wore palestina over head, not covering whole face, only his hair

Thanks very much for any help, my best guess for a game is Far Cry 3, but of all the main characters, none is him, neither he was in FC4.

In the first song, it's the part after the drop (1:03) that specific  kind of delayed bass kick together with the melody sounding like it's played on accordion. In the second song it's the same thing, but at 1:45, the tempo is little bit different, yet it still confirms the delayed bass kick and accordion-like melody.

It doesn't have to be with a pedals, since I have them from my old steering wheel, which only turns about 90° and I feel it uncomfortable.

* All GoG rules apply
* Post Steam ID
* Tell me what game and why are you the most excited of shown in E3 (For me it is Dishonored 2 and Just Cause 3)
* Also the old gold ""Pick a number in the range of 0-500""
* Try to guess my favourite game (Hint: It is not CSGO even though I have about 580 hours in it)
* Post why you want the game

I think this is fair, since it requires no special skill, just a bit of luck and not being lazy but writing a nice reason why you should win this game, why are you the chosen one. It doesn't have to be long, but it has to show me that you are the person that will get Payday.

Thanks, have a nice day, I will close this giveaway and choose a winner when the requests will slow down (I am giving it maximum of 24 hours, that means about 21/6 11:00PM CET (UTC+1)",GiftofGames,[Offer] PAYDAY 2,http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3ajmbi/offer_payday_2/

It all started out with a discussion where I was asking what is a good game for 5.50$ (http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/3abigz/discussion_i_have_550_what_is_the_best/) and then, out of nowhere MajorBen came, and told me that he can add 14.50$ to add up to 20$ so I can buy game for 20 bucks. That moment, I was already really shocked that person can just come by and give money to strangers, he asked me for PayPal, which I then sent with a little bit of shame of just requesting money from somebody. Then I waited little bit and after that a PM came to my inbox saying ""Check your email"" I was so excited. Then, when I logged in to the PayPal, I saw different sum, bigger sum, it was like 5 seconds until everything added up. It was 50 US DOLLARS. The euphoria intensified and I was just sitting there for good minute wondering what the hell is happening, I thought at first maybe it was a mistake and Ben wanted to send 5$, but it wasn't.

$50 for a stranger on the internet, that is crazy, and you are awesome person /u/MajorBen1997 which should receive tons of positive karma and vibes, I feel like regular thanks isn't enough, but I don't know what more to do, so at least I will make sure to send the most positive vibes up your way to boost up your mood a little bit when I know that it is not the best on your side right now. I will also give back to the community, I promise.
