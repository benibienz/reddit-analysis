108,"First a bit about myself &amp; my disability. I was born 32 years ago with cerebral palsy that has effected the growth of the left side of my body and mainly the fine motor skills of my left hand and left Achilles tendon which is a bit tighter than it should be.

I grew up just south of Detroit most of my youth but I've also lived in Detroit years later. As I grew up I went to about 10 different schools before graduating and this limited my myself on how to keep friends &amp; long term relationships later on down the road. In high school I started to come out of my shell more but was also harassed a lot by others. The last day of school someone brought in a cake just to throw at me for no other reason than to have a laugh. That same day I lit my notebook on fire on the far side of the parking lot and the school didn't want to allow me to graduate but I did however I didn't get to walk down the isle. This hurt my mother who was going blind at the time because she didn't know how bad her blindness would progress.

After high school I tried community college but that didn't work out. I also started hanging out with an old friend and his friends which led to worst friends then even worst friends. I then got friend zoned by a slut who later died for being a slut &amp; having too many kids. I was hanging out in ghetto areas, and just avoiding responsibilities because my depression was bad &amp; I thought I was worthless.

I finally fell in love but the relationship was long distance and I screwed that up by cheating then she got preggo by someone else a few months after we broke up. This caused me to go into a deep depression and I really wanted to die. For the longest time I wasn't even sure it was my fault or not, as this is a longer story. Then the slut I mentioned before recommended another chick I met, I should have known better about her but was retarded, she seemed nice however she lied to me and I got the gift that keeps on given. We broke up after almost a year. When I was with her I was living in the ghetto of detroit.

Just after that breakup, my great grandfather who I had been living with mostly since after high school started to give up on life at 84. This hurt me a lot and I got angry at him for it. I said somethings I still regret today that I can't take back. A few months went by and I watched him deteriorate from Alzheimer’s. Then he almost died in my arms from being so weak. He died a day or two later.. This killed me inside because he was the most generous, kind and loving man I've ever known. He was better than my own father and I was closer to him than my father who was also his grandson.

After he died I found I couldn't live there anymore so I moved across the state to my moms to try and start over. I found a place &amp; lived in seclusion in a small 1 bedroom apartment with no cable or phone or air conditioning or a car. I tried finding a job which as expected didn't work out due to my disability and was fired.

I then tried to turn my life around by studying linux and what I could about servers because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in that apartment. My dad worked for a internet hosting company a well as my brother who helped me study to get hired in which I did. It was hard work but I got to move out on my own again and I worked there for a year but was fired yet again because my disability and I couldn't keep up with the expectations of the job.

This caused me to lose my apartment and I had to move in with my other brother in a rural ghetto area of Battle Creek from Lansing. When I did I had no other choice and we didn't get along to start with before I went there. While living there it was a run down old house with bugs and mice and honestly should have been condemned. Me &amp; my brother verbally fought often until the one night around last x-mas &amp; I got so fed up with how my life had turned out that I took his gun and I was going to blow my brains out in front of him. He punched me in the face several times even though he knew I couldn't defend myself back. The next day I punched the refrigerator and broke my good right hand. This was very difficult for me to clean myself and do several tasks because neither hand could work right and my brother wasn't willing to help there. At the same time I was also looking for more work and I had to find a job soon because my brother was moving out within weeks to live with his gf and the other roommate that was there was going into the army. I would end up homeless. 

Barely, and I mean barely I luckily found another job but I had to move to Virginia in order to do so. My family helped with the move to get me down here. I've been working here in training for about 3 months yet low &amp; behold my disability get's in the way yet again and now I'm about to get fired tomorrow because I can't live up to their performance standards. I have no other skills to fall back on and will soon most likely lose my apartment, car and everything. I also have no family near by and no where to go. I tried reaching out to a local disability office and they had someone come out to observe me in order to see what I could do better to increase my performance but there was nothing he could offer and it was too late anyways if he could. So here I am in the middle of the night awaiting my fate that has always been guided by past mistakes, bad circumstance, and a shitty stroke when I was born and there is nothing that can be done about it.",2016-08-19 08:50:44+00:00,d6ntvn2,1.0,t3_4yfkqk,33121.0,AskReddit

I'm not saying I believe it but it makes me wonder what is it that if you boil down these ideas and expand on them.

123,"Either someone was watching with nostalgia glasses or I don't believe your opinion is genuine. I too re-watched the movie a few days ago and honestly the movie always felt like something MTV would make during that time. There are good parts and bad so let me run the bad down to begin with. 

1. I think the theatrical cut is not long enough and is missing certain points like how the first group get's in the mall as well as the second group which ties into Zach Snider's inability to edit a movie. 

2. I do like the Johnny Cash song intro however it became so cliche because it was so synonymous with the film. 

3. Disturbed sucks which is also cliche and part of that late 90's early 2000's pop diet rock along with Linkon Park, drowning pool and godsmack. 

4. The scene when they are having dinner in the mall and the power cuts out, then the camera cuts to the russian chick screaming from going into labor makes me laugh every time due to the predictable timing. 

5. it seemed the relationship between the nurse and the guy from best buy was forced considering how much she was upset over her husbands death and the time frame of events in the film.

6. It was so different from the original story of Dawn of the dead.

7. Get that damned camera out of my face.
    
Now what I did like about the movie..
    
1. I prefer the directors cut more because there are extra scenes that fill in those gaps of continuity for the most part like how they got into the mall to begin with.

2. I did like the opening of the movie up until she crashes the car and Johnny Cash intro which I skip over.

3. I did like some characters more than others like CJ, tucker, Andy, Ving Rahmes, the truck driver woman, and even though she was a bit dumb the daughter.

4. I did like the extra clips of Andy on the DVD.

5. I did like the extra loud shotgun Ving Rahmes had throughout the movie.

6. Richard Cheese which opened me up to his other better songs than that only one in the movie.

7. I did like the montage of them getting ready to leave the mall

8. I did like the cameo of the cop from the original Dawn of the dead and Tom Savini.",2016-08-14 16:50:01+00:00,d6h7mox,1.0,t3_4xk8vo,81445.0,movies

184,"I was a selfish idiot and cheated.. To start I was 24, still a virgin, and I was tired of waiting for that special person. I'm not attractive to begin with and a depressive recluse as well along with a physical disability from birth. 

I met this girl online from out of state and I wasn't sure how it would work out but we started to get to know each other more. I was falling for her but I held back emotionally due to the distance and her not wanting to share our relationship with others in her life. Meanwhile there was another local girl that I was starting to see and sleep with who is also not attractive but available. The closer I got to the girl out of state I broke it off with the other local girl. We are still good friends though and she's going to get married soon.

I saved enough money, over 1500$ to fly out to see her and we spent a week together which was one of the happiest moments of my life. I also saved up to buy her a nice necklace which I gave to her in that week to show how much I loved her.

After this it went down hill.. The fact that she still didn't want to tell anyone about me hurt and I was questioning our relationship more and more. Then I met this stupid slutty girl who I started to text very sexual texts. I never slept with her though. I felt so bad for the cheating texts I told the out of state girl the truth and we tried to work through it but I knew I wasn't able to continue with our relationship because I felt I didn't deserve to be in a relationship with anyone. This opened up a hole for her to say she wanted to hang out with some other guy which then I told her we should have some time apart. 3-4 months later I tried to get back in touch because I missed her a lot and she got preggo with some other guy she's been seeing for a month or so, as she said. This tore me apart inside and I went into a deep depression wanting to kill myself. Now they have 2 to 3 kids, house &amp; life and I'm 32, alone and struggling to find reason to continue on..

There was more bad shit that happened to me during the 3-4 month break and for a few more years after which I'm leaving out. ",2016-08-07 16:20:12+00:00,d67wihs,1.0,t3_4wk446,27774.0,AskReddit

309,"For me it's professional porn actors I find unattractive or porn ""stars"". I know I'm in a male minority but I guess I just think it's weird to watch the same man or women fuck over and over again either in the same movie or different movies. Also I don't like the blatant obviousness of professional porn like the over lighting, writing, scenery and scenarios. There's no effort involved because it seems so basic, compartmentalized and primitive to me like prescription grade sex crack. Although to be fair it has been awhile since I watched professional porn so maybe there is better porn out there, idk.

It's not that I don't advocate against porn but I just wish it was better, even though ""better"" is a loose term I hope someone gets what I mean. Maybe I'm just sexually repressed and look at porn as a basic way to just get off in order to clear your mind like periodically draining a pool that slowly fills. I'll still watch porn as a chore though.

I guess I prefer real sex more even if I don't get as much as I would like. Feeling the heat of another persons body on yours, hearing soft moans near your ear, running fingers through hair, holding each other close then finally enjoying as much as you can that race to the end, rinse &amp; repeat.

354,"Ahh the good ol' Michigan societal reinforcement that you'll end up a overweight truck driver who will complain about minorities and support Trump. 

Having grown up in MI it's such a shame how structured it is and how they push kids in this mentality from such a young age. I remember going to school and they divided the kids up into 3 groups. I think it was the gold team, the blue team and the red team. Looking back at it as an adult I realize the gold team were the smartest kids and you knew they were going to go to college and more, the blue team was in-between and would be ok working class, and lastly the red team which were delinquents, dumb asses and disabled or mentally challenged kids. Then you get older and they encourage jrotc and sports like football. Puberty sets in and little help is offered to guide kids to do better except for those awesome select few teachers that realize how the kids will end up driving truck or selling drugs and try to offer something better.

Then you get out of high school and either go off to college, work at your uncles dealership/carwash or hang out with pill poppers/druggies/gang members, maybe mix a bit of each. Then you find a great job or work in a meijers warehouse as a hi-lo driver or stay unemployed and hustle for money. You meet that girl at a party, and bang for a few weeks.. Now here's where life spilt's a bit for each group. The college couple use the pill, the blue collar couple wears a rubber but it breaks and the third group doesn't ""give-a-fuck"" and hopes for the best but it doesn't matter because that's what they expect life should be about by now.

A few more years go by and you hear about an old friend who dies from some rare-ish event. The college guy has a great corporate job and is married to the 2nd college gf and a baby is expected. The blue collar guy works and works and works and drinks and works while his wife is open in their relationship and being a free spirit desperately clasping to youth despite her resting bitch face from smoking and that small mouth scar from a broken Captain Morgan bottle fight with the girl who was caught cheating with the blue collar guy. You know.. Vikki, the one with the fat boobs, that big pot belly and oddly skinny legs that look like they couldn't possibly hold her top weight up. Then you have the hustler who went to county for a few months to a year or few for getting into a fight outside of a bar but also had a sprinkle of cut on 'em. He's a great guy to be around and to laugh with but is also a clepto with your lighters and other easily graspable things. His female calls churches to scam for money to feed her current 2 in custody kids and fighting with CPS for the older third child.

I say these things from experience and not to highlight any sexist or racist attributes. I've met and known so many people in Michigan that fall so close to these types and it's sad how guided schools, government, laws, bills, sex, popular culture &amp; substance abuse make who these people are. I'm not saying things can't change for anyone, the hustler could find a decent job and be better, the college guy could make the wrong investment or sleep with his wife's hotter sister.. IDK and they get divorced. But overall that doesn't usually happen. I've known a lot of people from different backgrounds and to me it's such a shame that we turn out this way with truly very little choices of who ,as average americans, we become. I just think it's sad overall.",2016-04-28 05:13:23+00:00,d2kcsyp,1.0,t3_4gpgn9,43608.0,mildlyinteresting

409,"That's basically what the counter culture has been since the advent of TV and probably even before that. If you look at the Vietnam era of the 60's &amp; 70's, I would think public opposition might have been less vocal if the horrors of the war were not broadcast while eating a TV dinner at home. 

Granted there was a lot of change during that time but issues like equal rights was a slow cooking pot that happened to boil over which had been heating up for much longer time. Overall that time was just a whirlwind of different issues that were set up like dominoes from years and decades prior that happened to fall into place. The counter culture itself of hippies and such was the youth of that time, which just turned out was also a huge generational population boost. Being a avg. 15-30 year old, just like today and before then, are heavily influential to the world around them. So as it goes having a strong opinionated environment causes a developing mind to absorb and make their own judgment equal to that environment. Simply put, they reacted to the world that was presented just like everyone does in their lives. It's no different today than it was thousands of years ago. In hindsight we look back and see what all happened but in the moment it's always just another day in the life.

I think the difference between then and now is that we might be more self aware of ourselves as a society than we were and will continue to grow like that because we like to look back at our past choices. We see the counter culture of that time as a symbol of massive change, turmoil and growth that meant something compared to now. 

However, a lot is the same. The youth and society will always be influenced by the ever developing world around them which includes pop culture media. Take a look at this [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akl9O4NLmKk) for 7up which tries to identify with the hippy counter culture. Then take a look at this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/51QLwfH.jpg) of 2 people with a brand of the monster energy drink label tattooed on them. That's how both sides try to identify with each other based on their environment and what's presented to them. 7up wants to fit in to make money and support jobs, the monster tattoo people try to fit in by advertising they like that drink, maybe to find others who also like monster, and also to show it in tattoo form is still looked at as a sign of rebellion. The truth is no one has a clue and most all of us are trying to nudge and make room in order to fit in. Are there other ways to be influenced than through pop culture? Sure, but I also think it's a big avenue of possibilities to meet others for procreation and for self fulfillment.",2016-03-20 14:54:17+00:00,d16qqrh,2.0,t1_d16hhiw,32387.0,movies

It's like they said ""Oh let's put that in and we can't forget to do this. and etc.."" One of the reasons why I like ATM is because, at least to me. each track has a different sound or theme they are going for.

418,"Herd mentality at it's finest. I will say I think that it is another patronizing exploitation movie like most movies being made today, this one is more targeted at women and idiots of both sexes who can't recognize a good story. 

To sincerely clarify, Another patronizing movie is Melissa McCarthy's Tammy which patronizes fat people or any Tyler Perry movie which is aimed at the black culture. Personally I think movies shouldn't try to be targeted to just 1 demographic, race, sex or subculture. All it does is retrace over the same dividing lines that keep us apart. This new GhostBusters movie looks like the latest in the modern trend in exploitation of self identity. Just look at the characters themselves. I remember this comment by /u/SopieMonkey for the [official photo thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3x2u6w/first_official_photo_from_paul_feigs_ghostbusters/cy146pd) from 2 months ago which describes each character perfectly merely based on the photo alone. Even the next comment by /u/sjwsgonnasjw saying
&gt;At some point in the movie Big Bertha will yell ""oh, HELL no.""

Guess what? The next comment after that 3 days go by /u/AggreCiv shows exactly [that](https://youtu.be/w3ugHP-yZXw?t=2m9s). This movie is formulaic and exploit as fuck. Why is it so hard to recognize this as such?",2016-03-07 15:31:57+00:00,d0qt2rr,5.0,t1_d0qmgl2,17135.0,videos

421,"This is probably the best honest description of the original Ghostbusters and what made it so great. It had such dry wit that it can't be remade in the culture we live in today. The jokes are funny without trying to be funny because it is the absurdity of the story juxtaposed with realism of the 80's and of life that carries it along. I mean take 3 nerdy slacker guys who leave college to take out a loan from the bank in order start a legit ghost catching business. Then they then have to find the car ecto1, hire a secretary, deal with snotty and skeptical clients, get a visit from the EPA, then have to hire another even more outside working class guy that adds a character the audience can relate and live vicariously through the ridiculousness of the plot as it goes forward. What really makes Ghostbuster memorable is the real life obstacles that they have to deal with which is more of a problem for them than actually catching the ghosts. They could be catching bats or alligators and it would still be funny, maybe not to the same degree but you get my point. This reboot/remake  am willing to bet as NONE of that.",2016-03-07 08:27:04+00:00,d0qkdaq,3.0,t1_d0qhtcf,7760.0,videos

441,I don't have a phone or video recorder but I do win at it often enough that I could probably win 6 times out of 10. You have to drop the quarter with as little spin or rotation as possible so it can fall flat and you have to aim for the second or 3rd to last step. If you aim for the winning step you will bounce the quarter due to the height. Once the quarter is settled just tap the top of the rotating handle so the quarter inches to the edge. Let it fall to the next step and repeat to win.,2016-02-16 05:04:52+00:00,d01ky1f,6.0,t1_d00ke0u,60593.0,pics
