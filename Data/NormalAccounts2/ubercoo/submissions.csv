I was born 32 years ago with cerebral palsy that has effected the growth of the left side of my body and mainly the fine motor skills of my left hand and left Achilles tendon which is a bit tighter than it should be. 

After years of living with it and working to gain better control, I started with opening up my left hand from a fist as a child then gaining more control with my first index finger, thumb and somewhat my middle finger. (Thank you video games). I would say the most effected area would be my ring finger that still wants to curl into a fist and my pinky that refuses to work on it's own. 

My left forearm tendon and wrist are also much weaker than they should be. My balance is okay, better than when I was a kid though but mainly due to the growth difference of the right side compared to the left. It's a bit tough for me to run long distance because as I shift my weight to my left leg my leg is not long enough to have a bent knee so it feels like I'm running with a peg-leg. There is also a difference in my waist height. I wanted to describe my condition for you to get an idea of what I have to deal with daily.

Now when it comes to my job I work as a support tech for a Internet Hosting Company. My previous job was also a more advanced support tech but I couldn't work to their standards of production so they had to fire me after a year. My current job is more adamant in there production standards and I need to handle 4 contacts per hour(cph) before I can get out of the training program. After training they expect 6/cph to be done. This may not sound like a lot but I'm struggling to get 2-3 done while typing only one handed. I know the job pretty well and what usually needs to be done however the only thing that I keep coming back to why I can't keep up is that I simply can't type or maybe think fast enough due to my disability. My avg typing speed is about 35/wpm.

I don't want to lose yet another job because I was born a bit brain dead. This is the only skill I can rely on and I've been struggling most of my life trying to keep up when I work. No matter what I try I'm just not good enough because of this curse. One of the worst parts is I moved across the country for this job because it's not like walking into a taco bell and putting in a application. If I lose this job I'm going to lose my apt and my car and my life, yet again except this time I cant rely on family anymore either.

I'm starting to get really scared because I don't want to lose my life. I don't want to end up in some ghetto group home because that's the only place I could afford with my SSI/D. While also not able to find work because I can't hold down a job because of my disability. I shouldn't even be mentioning this but I even question why do I keep trying if I know this will keep happening to me. I have other issues as well which add to this outlook of pointlessness &amp; depression that I won't go further into detail but let's just say it's enough for me to consider other options than living.

There is a part of me that wants to wish there was a cure or a way that doesn't involve me simultaneously fighting to live externally and fighting against myself internally. However, I know the reality is those things don't exist. I have to live my life from birth to death never able to do the things I always dreamed of doing and watching others do them without a care or concern or an idea of living any other way.

EDIT: Spelling and I'm 32 not 3 years old. lol
    
EDIT 2: Thank you for the suggestions. I have looked into some advocacy places. Some have also suggested speech to text software such as dragon speech. I have tried this in the past but its difficult to do phone calls while talking to dragon, plus it takes quite a while to configure dragon to recognize my speech which means that takes away the time for work. If you know any other ways to help speed up my responsiveness and cph I'm all ears.",disability,"Afraid of losing yet another job, within the next week, due to my disability and I don't know what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/4wtbhf/afraid_of_losing_yet_another_job_within_the_next/

I just finished the first &amp; second season on netflix and look forward to watching the 3rd. From the wiki it says it's not getting the best reviews but on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543328/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt) it's got a 8/10 with almost 12,000 votes.

I would also like to know from any historians what they think of the show as to how accurate it is. I wish more people would watch it as I think it's a good show worth at least given a fair chance.

I'm trying to find out all I can about the area so more information the better. I've been doing some googling about the area and have gathered some information but not a lot. Thanks

Right now I'm looking for a relatively cheaper apartment to live in that I can afford. I seen that apartments are pretty high compared to where I live now.

* What can be recommended under $900?
* What is the general cost of living and cost of utilities or are any included?

I also seen that the area is divided up into neighborhoods, where are the places to look for and where to avoid?

What is there to do for fun? I know this is broad and subjective question but I'm open to hearing anything. I do know there are beaches but what else? Groups, nightlife, (theme) parks, underwater basket weaving? lol

Speaking of water, I noticed that the area is pretty low to sea level, how likely is flooding and anything I should know about that or other nature related stuff?

What is the general culture like? friendly &amp; open minded, southernly judgmental friendly, openly racist? lol

How do people drive? aggressive, passive, mixed?

Best places for food, drink, coffee without tourists?

From rushed editing, forced dialog, and ignoring major plot developements like CSM.

For those looking to make excuses and justifications some things shouldn't be ignored or brushed off. William, the take over date, purity, a ROCKET to the face in a cave! I truly hope this miniseries isn't just some half assed cash grab but rather has closure. 

If I were to make the miniseries I would have had CSM as a delusion or hallucination that only mulder could see like at the end of the series, plus it would add depth to why Scully couldn't be with mulder anymore. Mulder would have gotten lost in his paranoid thoughts more and more over time and it just became to much for them both. 

I would have 1 episode to resolve Scully's immortality,2 or 3 MOTW episodes and 1 of those be a sequel. 1 episode where Scully asks Gibson and Dogget to help find William for the second to last episode. Then finish with Mulder, Scully and William embracing their future together somehow while the world finally wakes up to the existence of aliens. Maybe one last deal is made and somehow Skinner is the last one left to carry on with the knowledge of what really happened as he testifies to congress on live TV.  Maybe he gives a nice speech for the reveal. This way the truth would be out there..
