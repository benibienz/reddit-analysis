14,"Bio sam sličan tebi. Isto sam imo 17 godina. Isto sam htio pit po klubovima i jebat. I tako, otišao sam jednom sa poznanicima u klub, pio, jeo govna, i nisam se zabavio. Ako sam se nekad htio ubit to je bilo onda. Probao sam otić s njima još jednom, i opet sam se osjećao isto, i bio sam 100% siguran da to nije za mene.   
I jebiga... tako sam bio jadan, čamio kod kuće, drko kao ti sada, i uhvatio sam se svojih nekih hobija i zanimacija, jer mi je bilo retardirano bit kod kuće i ne radit ništa.   
I tako, malo sam počeo pratit te krugove ljudi koji imaju slične interese, pratiš šta rade, di se kreću, gledaš kad će bit neka događanja, dođeš, pričaš s ljudima, pojedeš/popiješ.  
Dobra je stvar što kada nađeš takve prijatelje/cure, ne moraš se pred njima pretvarat da voliš pit, slušat cajke ili što već današnji normiji rade. S njima budeš takav kakav jesi zapravo, i oni te cijene na isti način na koji ti cijenih njih.  
tako sam ja u roku od 2 godine (17-19) došao od 4 prijatelja do njih 20-ak solidnih  s kojima se uvijek mogu zajebavat, I s kojima se ne moram pretvarat da sam netko tko nisam. I dobro je sve.  
Znači šema je ne gledat šta drugi rade, nego gledat šta ti želiš radit. Nać nešto što te ispunjava, nać ljude sa sličnim interesima i počet se družit s njima, pa nek sve ide svojim tokom.",2016-11-01 21:25:52+00:00,d9hf424,11,t1_d9hb8bg,4549,croatia
