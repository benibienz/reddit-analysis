Wells Fargo analyst David Maris views Valeant Pharmaceuticals' reported interest in selling Salix as ""more of an acknowledgment of significant challenges rather than a resolution."" Buying Salix for $13.1B and divesting it for $8.5B does not seem like a good business transaction, Maris tells investors in a research note titled ""Selling The Stove To Keep The Restaurant."" He estimates the sale of Salix would result in negative earnings per share impact of approximately $1.50-$1.80. Valeant's growth profile would be ""significantly reduced"" if Salix were sold, the analyst contends. Maris would not see Valeant as strong after such a transaction.

The firm's estimate for the S&amp;P 500's 2016 earnings per share is now at $105, down from $110. For 2017, it expects the S&amp;P 500's operating earnings per share to rise by 10% to $116, but that is down from its prior forecast for $123. For 2018, the firm expects a 5% increase to $122, below its prior view for $130. Goldman Sachs also issued a forecast for 2019, projecting the S&amp;P 500's earnings per share will rise by 4% to $127.
Lower expected growth in technology, financials and telecommunications explains the majority of the forecast reductions, the firm said. It noted financials and technology are the two largest S&amp;P 500 sectors based on earnings-per-share contribution, and both have registered disappointing operating earnings-per-share growth in 2016 to date.
Goldman Sachs is now estimating financials earnings per share will rise by just 1% in 2016, down from its prior forecast for 9% growth, while it now sees technology earnings per share falling by 4% this year and expects telecommunications operating earnings per share will also decline.
Goldman Sachs noted there was some improvement in the energy sector: ""Following the recent recovery in oil prices, we now expect energy sector losses will subtract only $1 from S&amp;P 500 EPS in 2016, compared with the -$3 contribution that we had previously forecast,"" the firm said.",Optionmillionaires,"Goldman Sachs on Monday reduced its earnings estimates for the components of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index through 2018,",https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/5946uy/goldman_sachs_on_monday_reduced_its_earnings/

Is inflation finally ready to take hold? Some investors are betting on it.
The return of inflation would mark a major shift in what's driving financial markets. If, in response, central banks beyond the U.S. begin scaling back unprecedented stimulus, including aggressive bond-buying programs, allowing government bond yields begin to rise, it could mark the end of the insatiable ""hunt for yield"" that has driven risky assets to record heights.
Indeed, some economists argue that the 35-year bull market in government bonds is in its final throes, if not already over. If so, that's the completion of a trend of ever-lower borrowing costs and the asset trends that have accompanied, could soon reverse.
See: Deutsche Bank  says 35-year party is over for bond bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/deutsche-bank-says-35-year-party-is-over-for-bond-bulls-2016-09-09)
It is still early days, and the so-called inflation trade has seen its share of false starts since the end of the financial crisis. But in their weekly ""Flow Show"" note on Friday, analysts led by  Michael Hartnett  at  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  offer the chart below, which shows the degree to which private clients have started to rotate into cyclical stocks, which typically do better as the economy grows, and Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which are designed to protect against inflation.
Those investors are rotating out of assets like Treasurys and stocks that tend to behave more like bonds.
Broader flow data shows a similar theme, with TIPS posting a 19th week of inflows, while bank loans, emerging-market debt and equity funds and materials continued to see inflows, they said. Meanwhile bond proxies like dividend-heavy telecom and utilities stocks have seen three straight weeks of outflows. Investors, nervous about the potential for rising yields have lightened positions in ""long duration"" bond funds for eight straight weeks, while ""short duration"" bond funds have seen eight straight weeks of inflows.
Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's price to a change in yield (bond prices fall as yields rise and vice versa). The longer the duration, the bigger hit prices will take as yields increase. Many analysts have expressed concern that investors, hunting desperately for yield, have overexposed their portfolios to duration risk, leaving the potential for a shock if yields rise.

(http://www.marketwatch.com/story/yield-chasing-investors-are-unknowingly-taking-this-big-risk-2016-06-22)The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is up nearly 40 basis points, or 0.4 percentage point, from its post-Brexit low. The yield traded near 1.74% on Friday and briefly topped 1.8% earlier this month. Yields remain historically low, but with central banks around the world expressing a desire for steeper yield curves and analysts seeing signs of inflationary pressure, shifting flows aren't a huge surprise.
That said, there have been false starts before, with analysts calling for a sustained rise in yields only to see them set another round of unimaginable lows. Indeed, a large chunk of the global government bond yields remain in negative territory.
But inflation-wary economists say the signs this time are much more convincing.  Torsten Slok , chief international economist at  Deutsche Bank , notes that U.S. inflation is trending higher no matter how it's measured (see chart below).
Slok, in a Friday note, argued that most investors are, in fact, still sleeping through the transition, but could suffer a rude awakening.
""There are more and more signs of inflation everywhere...to ignore what it means for the Fed and for the level of rates, and fixed income more broadly,"" he said. ""With higher inflation in the U.S., and the [ European Central Bank ] moving closer to tapering, the term premium is about to normalize...Add the likelihood of a coming big increase in government spending in the U.S. and the upside risks to inflation and long rates are even bigger.""",Optionmillionaires,Time for the inflation trade?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/58ognm/time_for_the_inflation_trade/

However, Lyon sees several reasons to be concerned about slowing futures orders, including increased competition, a lack of exciting new products, price reductions on signature basketball products, inventory building in China and Europe, and the post-Olympics deceleration of orders. Lyon maintained his Hold rating and lowered his price target to $52 from $56 on Nike shares",Optionmillionaires,$NKE Nike Downgrade - Concerns Mount,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/544d0e/nke_nike_downgrade_concerns_mount/

Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.""",Optionmillionaires,Rate hike in June?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/4jy29g/rate_hike_in_june/

Building permits were up 3.6% to a rate of 1.12M, versus expectations for them to be up 5.5%. Consumer prices in April rose 0.4% compared to the prior month, versus expectations for the CPI to be up 0.3%. If food and energy are removed, the core CPI reading was up 0.2%, matching expectations.

 OPEC  forecast that production by countries outside the cartel will help rebalance a global crude market that is seen prices fall by more than half since 2014, even though  OPEC  has declined to rein in its own production.
 OPEC  said in its monthly report that non- OPEC  production will fall by 740,000 barrels a day from 2015 to 56.4 million barrels a day this year--10,000 barrels a day less than  OPEC  previously predicted. Most of the decline will stem from cuts that U.S. oil producers are making to cut production that is become unprofitable with the oil-price rout.
 OPEC  forecast U.S. production this year will fall by 431,000 barrels a day from 2015 to 13.56 million barrels a day. The rest of the predicted non- OPEC  decline will come from lower investments and production delays in  China ,  Mexico , the  U.K. ,  Kazakhstan  and  Colombia .
Overall, oil companies world-wide will cut their exploration and appraisal investments during 2016, 2017 and 2018 to  $40 billion  annually, half the average annual spending of 2012 through 2014, the group said.
The reduction in non- OPEC  production is cushioning the effect of  OPEC's  rising output. A meeting between countries in April to discuss a production freeze collapsed after  Saudi Arabia  said it would only limit its production if  Iran  did too, according to officials from  Saudi Arabia  and other countries involved in the talks.
 Iran , which was released in January from international sanctions curbing its oil sales, hasn't agreed to production limits. Its oil output in April was 3.45 million barrels a day--up 198,000 barrels from a month earlier,  OPEC  said. That accounted for the cartel's entire output boost from March. Overall  OPEC  production last month was up 188,000 barrels a day, to 32.44 million barrels, from a month earlier.
 OPEC  said its higher output will be absorbed by rising global oil demand, which it predicted to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day from last year to 94.18 million barrels a day in 2016.
As a result, the glutted oil market has started to even out,  OPEC's  data shows. Global oil oversupply halved to 950,000 barrels a day, based on  OPEC's  production numbers in April, compared with overproduction of 2.13 million barrels a day in 2015.
The news came after the  International Energy Agency  said Thursday that a global glut had started to diminish. Worldwide oil stocks will fall to 200,000 barrels a day in the last six months of the year from 1.3 million in the first half, it said. The IEA has previously projected supply will exceed demand by an average of 1.5 million barrels a day in the first six months of 2016.",Optionmillionaires,OPEC Speaks - Says OIL glut will reduce over the year - Do you agree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/4j5qrw/opec_speaks_says_oil_glut_will_reduce_over_the/

His base case for FY17 is total iPhone unit growth of 4% to 217M, based on a 23% upgrade rate and a decline in new customers, he told investors.

Stocks opened in positive territory and continued to tack on gains all morning, pushing the averages to their best levels of the day near noon. The market has received some help from firming oil prices, which are up 2.5% and back above $44 per barrel for the U.S. benchmark. The strength has been broad based, with the S&amp;P 500, Dow and Nasdaq now all up by about 1% or more. ECONOMIC EVENTS: In the U.S., wholesale sales jumped 0.7% in March, while inventories rose 0.1%, marking the first increases in sales and inventories since September. In Asia, China's Consumer Price Index for April was in-line with expectations with a year-over-year increase of 2.3%, while the Producer Price Index came in better than expected with a decrease of 3.4%, versus the consensus expectation for a 3.7% decline. In Europe, German industrial production fell 1.3% month-over-month in March and its imports declined 2.3%, which both missed expectations. However, exports growth of 1.9% came in stronger than expected. COMPANY NEWS: Shares of SolarCity (SCTY) plunged about 25% after the company reported worse than expected first quarter adjusted losses and cut its fiscal year installation forecast. Another solar company, SolarEdge (SEDG), which reported better than expected results but gave quarterly guidance that fell short of expectations, also slid over 15%... Allergan (AGN) reported better than expected earnings on lower than expected quarterly sales and also announced that the company's board has authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $10B of the company's common stock. Allergan, which expects to execute $4B-$5B in open market repurchases over four to six months subject to favorable market conditions, rose 3% near midday... Shares of Gap (GPS) tumbled 12% after the company reported the fifth consecutive month of sales declines and also estimated first quarter earnings per share below analysts' expectations. MAJOR MOVERS: Among the noteworthy gainers was Akorn (AKRX), which rallied 14% after it reported quarterly earnings and completed its 2014 financial statement restatement. Also higher was WhiteWave (WWAV), which gained 6.5% after reporting quarterly earnings. Among the notable losers was NewLink Genetics (NLNK), which fell 35% after its IMPRESS trial, investigating a treatment for patients with resected pancreatic cancer, failed to meet its overall survival endpoint. Also lower were Nokia (NOK) and Omeros (OMER), which were down 7% and 15%, respectively, after reporting quarterly results. INDEXES: Near midday, the Dow was up 200.42, or 1.13%, to 17,906.33, the Nasdaq was up 46.33, or 0.98%, to 4,796.54, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 20.90, or 1.02%, to 2,079.5",Optionmillionaires,Top Market Stories at Mid-Day 5-10-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/4iq1xe/top_market_stories_at_midday_51016/
