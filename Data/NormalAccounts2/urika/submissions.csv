I wasn't able to find any definitive answers while researching my situation, please let me know if you can help:

We really just want to keep things simple but most advantageous for everyone involved. Suggestions, ideas?",tax,Schedule E sublessor questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/597bfi/schedule_e_sublessor_questions/
