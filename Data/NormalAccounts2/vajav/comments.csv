523,"I was riding the bus home from the mall, listening to music, and not paying attention to anything in particular. As we were stopped at one of the bus stops, a girl in the back screamed. I looked back and saw her pointing out the window, and I followed her stare. Out in an unfenced yard were three men. Two of them standing, and one of them was on the ground, bloody and twitching. The taller of the two men had a baseball bat, and was ready to smash it into the downed man's head, when the men realized a whole bus was looking at them. As the driver called 911, the other man, who hadn't been doing anything, took out a pistol out of his pocket, and shot the fallen man in the head. At this point, the whole bus was in shock and glued to the morbid scene. The two men got in a car and speed off. When I got home, I was visibly shaken. I told my mom what I had just seen.

He picks the drunk off the floor and starts ushering him toward the parking lot. On the way to the car, the guy falls down three times. The man gets him in the car and drives to the drunk's home. He gets him out of the car, and the drunk falls down four more times on their way to the front door. Propping the drunk up beside the door, the man rings the bell. The drunk's wife answers.

""Hi, ma'am. Your husband got really drunk at the bar, so I brought him back home for you.""
