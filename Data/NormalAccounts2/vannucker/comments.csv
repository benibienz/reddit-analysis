Middle-Eastern is often what we call someone from the Middle East, not East Indian... Unless you mistook the dark hair, dark skin as someone from India.

Indian is still used sometimes in Canada to refer to the natives, but people more say natives or First Nations.

Ordinary Men

Browning is best known for his 1992 book Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, a study of German Ordnungspolizei (Order Police) Reserve Unit 101, which used to commit massacres and round-ups of Jews for deportations to the Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland in 1942.

The conclusion of the book – influenced in part by Milgram experiments popularized in the 1970s – was that the men of Unit 101 killed out of a basic obedience to authority and peer pressure, not blood-lust or primal hatred.

In the story he recounts, the men of Unit 101 were not ardent Nazis but ordinary middle-aged men of working-class background from Hamburg, who had been drafted but found ineligible for regular military duty. After their return to Poland in June 1942 these men were ordered to terrorize Jews in the ghettos during Operation Reinhard, and in notable cases, committed wholesale massacres of all Polish Jews – men, women and children – as in the towns of Józefów and Łomazy.[2] In other cases, they were ordered to merely kill a specified number of Jews in a given town or area usually helped by Trawnikis. The commander of the unit gave his men the choice (once) of opting out of this duty if they found it too hard. Almost all of them chose not to exercise that option. Fewer than 12 men opted out in a battalion of 500 willing executioners.[3]

While the specifics of this book deal with killings performed by otherwise average men, the general implication of the book, consistent with the theories advanced by Stanley Milgram, is that when placed in a coherent group setting, most people will adhere to the commands given, even if they find the actions morally reprehensible. Additionally the book demonstrates that ordinary people will more than likely follow orders, even those they might personally question, when they perceive these orders as originating from an authority.

Ordinary Men achieved much acclaim but was denounced by Daniel Goldhagen for missing what Goldhagen considered the importance of a specifically-German political culture, characterized by what Goldhagen terms ""eliminationist anti-semitism,"" in causing the Holocaust. In his book review published in the July 1992 edition of The New Republic,[4] Goldhagen called Ordinary Men a book that fails in its central interpretation. Goldhagen's own controversial 1996 book Hitler's Willing Executioners was largely written to rebut Browning's book, but ended up being criticized much more.[5]",2016-10-29 07:23:11+00:00,d9cj40u,2.0,t1_d9bjhed,56232.0,canada

379,"This happened in Vancouver. The Pacific National Exhibition has been held on the same grounds since 1912. It is a big fair every August right beside Playland, a mini version of Six Flags opened in 1958.  Excellent venue 10 minutes from downtown and right off of the Freeway. 

In the late 90s early 2000s, people in the surrounding blocks got a huge complaint going about the Fair being too loud. Vancouver was soooooo close to moving it to Delta or Coquitlam, far off suburbs 45 mins from downtown. The Delta spot was going to be Burn's Bog. You don't even have to know what Burn's Bog is to know that would be a bad idea. 

Eventually, too many people said ""SCREW YOU NIMBYS! I've been going to the fair here since World War 2!"" And Vancouver has kept it in place and has even made the Fair bigger since that time

It is also funny, the surrounding blocks are full of usually Chinese/Asian families and the grandma/grandpa that can barely speak English is out on the street urging you to park in their driveway/ garage or in front of their house for $15, because the official Fair parking is $25, and the street parking is permit only.

Grandma probably contributes a nice amount of extra income to the family every year. Getting 1 or two people to park there every day for half of the year.

677,"For nearly four centuries, the Atlantic slave trade brought millions of people into bondage. Scholars estimate that around 1.5 million people perished in the brutal middle passage across the Atlantic. The slave trade linked Africa, Europe and the Americas in a horrific enterprise of death and torture and profit. Yet, in the middle of the 18th century, as the slave trade boomed like never before, some notable European observers saw it as a model of free enterprise and indeed of ‘liberty’ itself. They were not slave traders or slave-ship captains but economic thinkers, and very influential ones. They were a pioneering group of economic thinkers committed to the principle of laissez-faire: a term they themselves coined. United around the French official Vincent de Gournay (1712-1759), they were among the first European intellectuals to argue for limitations on government intervention in the economy. They organised campaigns for the deregulation of domestic and international trade, and they made the slave trade a key piece of evidence in their arguments.",2016-06-30 06:12:47+00:00,d4tnm4f,1.0,t3_4qk7s6,10.0,history

749,"In case you missed the explaination above.

 Because it contradicts the official Russian narrative that they're hitting only ""terrorist"" positions.

The very nature of cluster munitions make them indiscriminate - showering expanses with little bomblettes is hardly the ""precision"" striking Russia claims it only does. Cluster bombs are good for taking out armor columns and large infantry formations; drop them on cities though, and you end up killing a lot of people you didn't intend to.

What's worse is that often a percentage of the submunitions won't detonate on impact, leaving live explosives over large areas for years at a time until some unlucky person accidentally triggers them.

If Russia wants to bomb Isis, great. But when they tell you they A. Don't target civilians and B. Don't use cluster bombs, and evidence emerges to the contrary, it begins to show that Russia's campaign is inflicting a whole lot more harm on the general populace than they want you to believe.

784,"Have you gone through puberty? If not, you can grow a lot. If so you are fucked. I hit puberty relatively late at 15 and went from 5'2 to 5'8 pretty quickly. I'm still a bit short on average but whatever. 

One of my friends hadn't hit puberty by 16, so his doc gave him a few shots of HGH (Human Growth Horomone) and he grew from 5' to 5'9 in a year.

Supposedly people who get this HGH treatment end up 3 inches taller than those who do not. SO my friend would have only ever grown to 5'6 had he not receive the treatment. 

So if you are very concerned go see your doc and demand the HGH shots. As far as I know there are so negative side effects to the HGH shots. My friend is 30 now and as normal as can be. 

I think some doctors will do it if you tell them you have extreme anxiety about your height, get made fun of etc. Because it is damaging to mental health and doctors are there to prevent that even if it is in an indirect way like helping you grow taller.

Also, act fast if you want the HGH shots because if your growth plates in your bones set, which means they turn from soft to hard, then you are officially done growing. You have to use the HGH while your growth plates are still soft and in grow-mode.

1010,"In the 1950s, the Soviet Union reveals its newest asset to be Superman. The sudden revelation of a superpowered alien under Soviet control causes panic in the United States, shifting the focus of the Cold War arms race from nuclear weapons to superhumans. CIA agent James Olsen recruits Lex Luthor, a scientist employed by S.T.A.R. Labs, to destroy Superman. Luthor's first act is to cause Sputnik 2 to plummet towards Metropolis. After Superman diverts the satellite away from the city, Luthor retrieves his genetic material and creates a monstrous clone of Superman whom Lex Luthor officially names Superman 2 when he is unveiled to Olsen.
Art from Superman: Red Son, by Dave Johnson

Meanwhile, Superman meets Wonder Woman at a diplomatic party, and she becomes smitten by him. Pyotr Roslov, the head of the NKVD and Joseph Stalin's illegitimate son, is angry that Superman has turned his father's attention away from him and ended his chances of advancement within the Soviet regime. Pyotr shoots a dissident couple in front of their son for printing anti-Superman propaganda. Stalin dies from cyanide poisoning, and Superman initially refuses command of the Communist Party. However, a chance meeting with Lana Lazarenko, his childhood sweetheart, changes his mind. Superman chooses to use his powers for the greater good and turn his country into a utopia.

The U.S. government sends ""Superman 2"" to engage Superman, and their duel causes an accidental nuclear missile launch in Great Britain. The clone sacrifices itself to save millions. Luthor murders his research staff at S.T.A.R. Labs and founds LuthorCorp, dedicating his life to destroying Superman.

By 1978, the United States is on the verge of social collapse whereas the prosperous Soviet Union has peacefully expanded its influence to nearly every corner of the globe. The cost of this progress is an increased infringement on individual liberties, with Superman fast becoming a Big Brother-like figure; a brain surgery technique that turns dissidents into obedient drones, or ""Superman Robots"", is in use. Superman now works with Wonder Woman to save lives as well as govern the Soviet state. Wonder Woman has become enamored of Superman, but he considers her simply as a comrade, and is oblivious to her love for him.

Luthor plans to shrink Moscow, but this plan fails when Brainiac, his collaborator, shrinks Stalingrad instead. Superman intervenes and retrieves both Brainiac's central processing unit and the tiny city, putting an end to the Brainiac-Luthor cooperation. He is unable to restore Stalingrad and its inhabitants to their proper size. This becomes his one failure and a source of great guilt.

Luthor's second plan involves Batman, who was the boy orphaned by Pyotr. Batman joins forces with LuthorCorp and Pyotr, now head of the KGB. They capture Wonder Woman and use her as bait for Superman, hoping to sap his powers with rays that imitate the light of Superman's home planet. The plan works, but Superman convinces Wonder Woman to break free of the lasso that she is tied up with and destroy the generators running the lamps emitting the solar rays of Superman's home planet. She does, severely injuring herself in the process, but the lamps stop running and Superman's powers return. Scared that Superman was going to lobotomize him and turn him into a robot, Batman kills himself as a martyr to his cause. Pyotr is turned into a Superman robot, and Wonder Woman no longer has feelings for Superman as he shows little to no regard for her injured condition.

Luthor enacts his third plan when he finds a mysterious green lantern found in an alien ship that crashed at Roswell, New Mexico. Brainiac is reprogrammed into Superman's aide, and the construction of a Fortress of Solitude, located in Siberia and referred to as ""The Winter Palace"", begins. Superman's reign continues with no crime, poverty, or unemployment, but with an ever-present state authority. Superman is committed to ""winning the argument"" with the U.S., and repeatedly refuses Brainiac's suggestions of an invasion. Stalingrad remains his one failure, now contained within a protective glass ""bottle"".

The USA elects Luthor and Olsen as President and Vice President. Using his scientific expertise, massive economic capital and dictatorial powers, Luthor returns prosperity to his country. This is only a part of a more general plan to provoke Superman into invading the United States. Luthor shows Olsen two of his greatest discoveries: the Phantom Zone, a place that super-hearing cannot reach; and the Green Lantern Corps.

Luthor confronts Superman in the Winter Palace. Brainiac yanks Luthor deep into the recesses of the Fortress to be converted surgically into a Superman Robot, claiming that Lex would convince Superman to commit suicide in less than fourteen minutes. Superman agrees that his hand has been forced, and prepares to attack.

First Lady Lois Luthor visits Paradise Island to forge an alliance with the Amazon empire, now ruled by an embittered and vengeful Wonder Woman. Superman attacks the East Coast, confronting and defeating the Green Lantern Marine Corps, which is led by Colonel Hal Jordan. The Amazon forces, commanded by Wonder Woman, attack Superman but are quickly defeated, along with a collection of ""super-menaces"" (including Atomic Skull, Parasite and Doomsday) that Luthor has put together over the years. Brainiac's spaceship cuts the U.S. Pacific fleet to pieces, and the two superbeings meet at the White House. They are greeted by Lois Luthor with the last weapon, a small note written by Lex that reads, ""Why don't you just put the whole world in a bottle, Superman?""

Realizing he has meddled in affairs that he had no place in, Superman orders Brainiac to end the invasion. Brainiac, however, reveals it has never been under Superman's control, and instead attacks Superman with green kryptonite radiation. Brainiac is shut down from inside by Luthor, who evaded surgery. As the singularities powering Brainiac's ship threaten to collapse, Superman rockets it into space, where it explodes. The Earth is saved, but Superman is apparently dead.

The Soviet Union falls into chaos, but is soon brought back under control thanks to the Batmen (resistance members who began wearing the costume after Batman's death). Lex Luthor integrates many of Superman's and Brainiac's ideas into the new philosophy of ""Luthorism"" and forms a ""Global United States"". This becomes the defining moment for mankind's future as it enters an unprecedented age of peace and stability. A benevolent world government is formed and maintained. Luthor presides over a string of scientific achievements, including the curing of all known disease, and colonization of the solar system. Luthor lives for over one thousand years.

At Luthor's funeral, it is revealed that Superman survived the explosion of Brainiac's ship and is apparently immortal. Superman attends the funeral wearing a business suit and thick glasses essentially identical to the appearance of Clark Kent, an identity he never adopted in this timeline. Luthor's widow, Lois, sees this mysterious figure in the crowd and, other than an eerie sense of deja vu, suspects nothing. Superman walks quietly away from the ceremony, planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them.

Billions of years in the future, Earth is being torn apart by tidal stresses from the sun, which has become a red giant. Luthor's distant descendant, Jor-L, sends his infant son, Kal-L, rocketing back into the past. The final panels of the comic book depict the landing of Kal-L's timeship in a Ukrainian collective in 1938, effectively causing a predestination paradox (and, thus, making Superman a descendant of Luthor).",2016-05-18 00:07:35+00:00,d39jdty,5.0,t1_d396p3y,17350.0,todayilearned

1307,"Honestly, after being a fan off MMA for over 10 years, I like the quick interim. I am so so so so sick of half of title belts being canceled. Injuries always lead to more injuries for guys and pretty soon you have a year wait between defenses like Aldo, Cain, Cruz, and many others have done. 

Just put out a quick interim out there, then there is no question who the number on contenders are, and the interim can change a few times if necessary if the champ is out an extended time. 

Then when the unification fight happens, it is even more hyped. It is a win for fans, the company, and the fighter who wins the interim.

In future fights for the rest of that fighters life if he never wins the full belt, Buffer can always announce, ""the former, interim light heavyweight champion of the woorrrllddd."" 

It will also give the fighter a but more leverage in contract discussion. The former interim champ can say he was the interim, he is better and deserves more pay than so and so #5 ranked fighter because that guy was never the interim.

Plus there is also more smack talk with the champ saying, ""your belt is a paper belt, it's worth nothing."" And the other guy will say, ""I'm the true champ and Imma prove it!""

Also, Dana can't pass over the interim with a hot prospect with a flashy win.",2016-04-03 01:09:18+00:00,d1nlhxl,2.0,t1_d1nfy8b,9566.0,MMA

1439,"Plot summary from wikipedia:

As his family prepares to be ""Jaunted"" to Mars, Mark entertains his two children by recounting the curious tale of the discovery and history of teleportation. He explains how the scientist who discovered the Jaunt quickly learned that it had a disturbing, inexplicable effect on the mice sent through the two Jaunt portals. The mice would either die instantly or behave erratically before dying moments later. The scientist eventually concluded that they could only survive the ""Jaunt effect"" while unconscious. That, the father explains, is why all people must undergo general anaesthesia before using the Jaunt.

Mark spares his children the gruesome semi-apocryphal account of the first human to be Jaunted awake, a condemned murderer offered a full pardon for agreeing to the experiment. The man came through and immediately suffered a massive heart attack, living just long enough to utter a single cryptic phrase: ""It's eternity in there...""

Mark also doesn't mention that since the inception of the technology, roughly thirty people have Jaunted while conscious, voluntarily or otherwise. Each time, they either died instantly or emerged insane. One woman was even shoved alive into eternal limbo by her husband, stuck between two Jaunt portals. Even though his attorneys attempted to argue that he was not guilty on the grounds that his wife was technically still alive, the implications of that argument only served to secure and hasten his murder conviction and execution.

Mark then reveals the nature of why any conscious being goes insane or dies after being Jaunted. It is theorized that while physically the process occurs nearly instantaneously, to a conscious mind it lasts an eternity. One is simply left alone with their thoughts in an endless field of white for what is suggested to be possibly anywhere from hundreds to billions of years. However, the father is careful in his wording to keep from scaring his family.

After Mark finishes his story, the family is subjected to the sleeping gas and Jaunted to Mars. When Mark wakes, he is first aware of screaming. He finds his inquisitive son Ricky's hair suddenly lengthened and white with shock and cackling like a lunatic. Ricky held his breath while being administered the general anesthesia in order to experience the Jaunt while conscious, and has been rendered completely insane. Ricky confirms the terrible nature of the conscious Jaunt, shrieking ""It's longer than you think, Dad! Longer than you think!"" Ricky then claws his own eyes out as he is wheeled away from his horrified family by several Jaunt attendants.",2016-03-18 23:58:40+00:00,d155sdk,3.0,t1_d14e105,44668.0,AskReddit

Isaac Newton: 17th-Century London’s Dirty Harry
  
Judy Dutton



The science titan wasn’t used to being outsmarted. But after two years of trying to shut down English counterfeiting, one underworld kingpin was still getting the better of him.

Back in 1695, England’s Royal Mint discovered a serious problem: A massive portion of the circulating currency was phony. As counterfeiting methods grew increasingly clever, the Mint turned to England’s brightest mind for a solution. Isaac Newton was appointed Warden of the Mint, a one-man army who waded through London’s underbelly to restore the currency’s integrity. Most counterfeiters were easy prey for Newton, but William Chaloner, a shadowy kingpin, kept eluding his grasp.

Chaloner had trained as a nail maker’s apprentice, but he found a more lucrative application for molten metals: coining 30,000 guineas. The counterfeiter’s self-made wealth enabled him to pose as a gentleman and gave him an ego to match his intellect.

Newton wanted nothing more than to destroy Chaloner, and the feeling was mutual.

Chaloner appeared before a parliamentary committee, where he insinuated that Newton was incompetent and blamed Mint employees for the epidemic of phony coins. Enraged, Newton intensified his efforts.

When Chaloner set up a coining facility in Egham, 20 miles outside of London, Newton sensed an opening. He began studying Chaloner’s sophisticated casting method—which involved pouring molten metal into brass molds before filing down the molds’ faces, resulting in much sharper images on the phony coins.

By September 1697, Newton had enough evidence to lock Chaloner up—but not for long. Working through intermediaries inside the prison and out, Chaloner bribed the prosecution’s star witness into fleeing to Scotland. Chaloner was released and accused Newton of framing an innocent man.

This attack on Newton’s integrity was the last straw. If Chaloner was going to play dirty, then so was Newton. Acting more the grizzled sheriff than an esteemed scientist, Newton bribed crooks for information. He started making threats. He leaned on the wives and mistresses of Chaloner’s crooked associates. In short, he became the Dirty Harry of 17th-century London.

After nearly two more years of relentless pursuit, Newton’s extreme measures had gathered enough evidence to put Chaloner away for good. This time, the charges stuck. On March 3, 1699, the counterfeiter was found guilty of high treason. The next day he was sentenced to hang. In the days before the execution, Chaloner wrote Newton a long, rambling letter proclaiming his innocence. The condemned counterfeiter begged his old rival for mercy, writing, “O dear Sir nobody can save me but you.”

Newton felt no pity. He snubbed his rival by not attending the hanging. As Newton had written during Chaloner’s first trial, the counterfeiter had formed “a confederacy against the Warden.” Chaloner could have lived a long, honest life had he “let the money &amp; Government alone.”

With Chaloner dispatched, Newton torched the records of his investigation, likely to cover up the murky steps he took to help save the pound. In 1703, he gave up crime fighting and returned to academia as president of the Royal Society. England’s currency was once again safe from scoundrels like Chaloner, and criminals and thinkers alike had learned a valuable lesson: You don’t mess with Isaac Newton.",2016-03-12 10:59:03+00:00,d0x26zd,1.0,t3_49ydo9,84930.0,history

1549,"Doping

Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of banned substances on 16 September 2015 effective starting 1 January 2016;[31] it was previously on WADA's list of drugs to be monitored.[32][33] WADA considers the drug to be a “metabolic modulator”, similar to insulin. A December 2015 study in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis argued that meldonium “demonstrates an increase in endurance performance of athletes, improved rehabilitation after exercise, protection against stress, and enhanced activations of central nervous system (CNS) functions.” [34] On 7 March 2016, former world number one tennis player Maria Sharapova announced that she had failed a drug test in Australia due to the detection of meldonium. She said that she had been taking the drug for ten years for various health issues, and had not noticed that it had been banned.[35][36] Earlier the same day, Russian ice dancer Ekaterina Bobrova, announced she had also tested positive for meldonium at the 2016 European Figure Skating Championships, Bobrova was ""shocked"" about the test result, she stated that she had been aware of meldonium's addition to the banned list (on 1 January 2016) and had been careful to avoid products containing banned substances.[37] Other athletes who are provisionally banned for using meldonium include Swedish Ethiopian-born middle-distance runner Abeba Aregawi,[38] Turkish middle-distance runner Gamze Bulut,[39] Ethiopian long-distance runner Endeshaw Negesse[40], Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov,[41] and Ukrainian biathletes Olga Abramova[42] and Artem Tyshchenko.[43]",2016-03-08 06:53:42+00:00,d0rt5u5,2.0,t1_d0r61ap,37263.0,sports

1597,"Just providing context. If no parties were harmed in the arrangement and no one thinks its wrong and it was normal for the society and everyone is happy, it is kind of unfair to impose modern day societal norms onto them. Pretend for example if psychologists and society of the year 3400 collectively decide that the human brain does not fully develop until 25(true) and people make lots of bad choices before then, so the new age of consent is 25, and they look back at our society and a bunch of people like my dad (25 years old when met my 19 year old mom) as statutory rapists. Im just trying to suggest that it is easy to sit here and criticize people and norms of 1400 years ago but it is not black and white especially in situations where no one is harmed and the people don't feel harmed. Slavery and burning witches are easier to criticize because people are dying but in muhammeds situation all family members were perfectly fine with the arrangement.

1600,"Now I know in today's society with our social norms it is wrong and we know a lot about child development and we have an advanced society where women experience much freedom and opportunity, but as a fan of history I will try and defend him somewhat. Different times had different social norms. People got married young and had arranged marriages back then. There were no psychologists to determine how mentally developed people were. Even the idea of childhood is a recent one dating back to the 1800s. Before then, girls and boys were expected to have many adult responsibilities like working on the farm and in trades with their parents.  It was the parents job to find a husband for their daughters. When a woman hit puberty she was considered a woman. Women knew they had a duty to get married and have lots of babies. All parties could have been perfectly fine with the arrangement. From what I heard they ended up being madly in love and there was no resentment on any side. It was just the way society worked. I am no expert on early Islam but woman do gave divorce rights in Islam so she could have gotten out of the marriage but from what we know is that she was proud of her marriage long after he was dead.",2016-03-04 19:02:34+00:00,d0nno79,,t1_d0ngijg,9860.0,atheism

The trial was all over the papers and played to gothic themes that were popular at the times of a poor helpless girl kept in a dungeon and tortured. The trial brought a lot of attention to how the colonies were run and the brutalities that occured.

Can't recommend this book enough. It reads almost like a novel but with sources. It covers one of the most sensational trials of early 19th century England (where the trial took place) and played an important part in ending slavery in the British Empire. Here is a synopsis.

In 1806 General Thomas Picton, Britain's first governor of Trinidad, was brought to trial for the torture of a free mulatto named Louisa Calderon and for overseeing a regime of terror over the island's slave population. James Epstein offers a fascinating account of the unfolding of this colonial drama. He shows the ways in which the trial and its investigation brought empire 'home' and exposed the disjuncture between a national self-image of humane governance and the brutal realities of colonial rule. He uses the trial to open up a range of issues, including colonial violence and norms of justice, the status of the British subject, imperial careering, visions of development after slavery, slave conspiracy and the colonial archive. He reveals how Britain's imperial regime became more authoritarian, hierarchical and militarised but also how unease about abuses of power and of the rights of colonial subjects began to grow.

1787,"The US also had vast swaths of land ready to be settled (once the natives were driven off). The US put a hard cap on immigration in 1924 at 150,000. Before that they also restricted selected groups like the Chinese. 

Canada, which I am more familiar with being Canadian, also did similar things. When they needed settlers for the Prairies, they did drives in Europe (especially Eastern Europe due to the harsh winter climate that many Ukranians were used to) and let in tens of thousands of people per year to fill the land. Once the land was filled, they started restricting it to a number again. 

Right now Canada lets in under 1% (around 250,000) of it's 35,000,000 population per year, which is an acceptable amount to intergrate. Due to the extreme nature of the Syria crisis, Canada has agreed to let in 75,000 Syrian refugees after they have been vetted, or a 0.22% of our population. 1 refugee for every 450 people rather than 1 for every 11 in Greece, or 1 for every 80 for Germany. 

Also Canada gets to choose who they let in so we are picking good candidates, like families with a skilled worker. Not unskilled swaths of the underclass. ",2016-02-15 03:58:17+00:00,d00asb2,4.0,t1_d0007hu,19421.0,worldnews

1931,"In 2007, Nilsson and his team demonstrated that the box jelly Tripedalia cystophora uses its lower lensed eyes to spot approaching obstacles, like the mangrove roots that it swims among. It took them another four years to discover what the upper lensed eyes do. The first big clue was a free-floating weight at the bottom of the rhopalium that ensures that the upper eye is always looking upward, even if the jellyfish swims upside down. If this eye detects dark patches, the jellyfish senses that it’s swimming beneath the mangrove canopy, where it can find the small crustaceans that it eats. If it sees only bright light, it has strayed into open water, and risks starving. With the help of its eyes, this brainless blob can find food, avoid obstacles, and survive.

The box jellyfish’s eyes are part of an almost endless variation of eyes in the animal kingdom. Some see only in black and white; others perceive the full rainbow and beyond, to forms of light invisible to our eyes. Some can’t even gauge the direction of incoming light; others can spot running prey miles away. The smallest animal eyes, adorning the heads of fairy wasps, are barely bigger than an amoeba; the biggest are the size of dinner plates, and belong to gigantic squid species. The squid’s eye, like ours, works as a camera does, with a single lens focusing light onto a single retina, full of photoreceptors—cells that absorb photons and convert their energy into an electrical signal. By contrast, a fly’s compound eye divides incoming light among thousands of separate units, each with its own lens and photoreceptors. Human, fly, and squid eyes are mounted in pairs on their owners’ heads. But scallops have rows of eyes along their mantles, sea stars have eyes on the tips of their arms, and the purple sea urchin’s entire body acts as one big eye. There are eyes with bifocal lenses, eyes with mirrors, and eyes that look up, down, and sideways all at the same time.",2016-01-16 07:00:52+00:00,cz06wr8,1.0,t3_417bna,9.0,science

1981,"Read this article. The documentary left out some pretty damning stuff. 

http://www.pajiba.com/netflix_movies_and_tv/is-steven-avery-guilty-evidence-making-a-murderer-didnt-present.php

Here is the meat of the article:

-- The documentary said that part of Avery's criminal past included animal cruelty. To my recollection, it didn't specify exactly what that animal cruelty was. I know that for some of our readers, knowing is enough to want to see Avery get the death sentence regardless of whether he murdered Halbach: He doused a cat in oil and threw it on a bonfire (this is not relevant to the murder trial, but it certainly diminishes the sympathy some of us felt for him).

-- Past criminal activity also included threatening a female relative at gunpoint.

-- In the months leading up to Halbach's disappearance, Avery had called Auto Trader several times and always specifically requested Halbach to come out and take the photos.

-- Halbach had complained to her boss that she didn't want to go out to Avery's trailer anymore, because once when she came out, Avery was waiting for her wearing only a towel (this was excluded for being too inflammatory). Avery clearly had an obsession with Halbach.

-- On the day that Halbach went missing, Avery had called her three times, twice from a *67 number to hide his identity.

-- The bullet with Halbach's DNA on it came from Avery's gun, which always hung above his bed.

-- Avery had purchased handcuffs and leg irons like the ones Dassey described holding Halbach only three weeks before (Avery said he's purchased them for use with his girlfriend, Jodi, with whom he'd had a tumultuous relationship -- at one point, he was ordered by police to stay away from her for three days).

-- Here's the piece of evidence that was presented at trial but not in the series that I find most convincing: In Dassey's illegally obtained statement, Dassey stated that he helped Avery moved the RAV4 into the junkyard and that Avery had lifted the hood and removed the battery cable. Even if you believe that the blood in Halbach's car was planted by the cops (as I do), there was also non-blood DNA evidence on the hood latch. I don't believe the police would plant -- or know to plant -- that evidence.

I certainly believe that there was a tremendous amount of police misconduct in this case. I believe the police helped the case against Avery along by planting evidence (and there's no doubt in my mind that they planted the RAV4 key in Avery's trailer). I also don't believe the prosecution's theory of events: There's no way Halbach was raped and had her throat slashed in the trailer without a speck of DNA evidence, and there's no way she was shot in the garage without any blood splatter evidence. After all, if Avery had somehow used bleach to erase all trace of Halbach's DNA, he would've also cleaned the garage of his own DNA (and the garage still contained lots of Avery's DNA).

I don't know how Avery murdered Halbach. I also don't believe anything that Dassey said in his coerced confession, but I also won't rule out Dassey's involvement because he would've done anything anyone asked of him. Still, the idea that the police killed Halbach is impossible to believe, not because they weren't capable of it, but because of the planning and foresight it would've required.

I also believe that Adnan Syed is guilty, but in both cases, I don't believe the jury should've convicted because there simply wasn't enough unimpeachable evidence to support a guilty verdict. I am even more convinced than after Serial that the jury system is fucked, but ironically, in both cases, I also think the jury arrived at the correct conclusion.


Updated: Here's some additional damning evidence against both Avery and Dassey either not presented in the series, or not presented in its entirety.

-- The reporter from the doc who had all the great reaction shots, added this:

    @winklmann @sportstao @mjguff Not sure about most glaring. But Teresa's camera and palm pilot were found in Avery's burn barrel.

-- In this phone conversation (transcript in link) with his mother (which is not entirely included in the docuseries), Brendan told his mother that he did it, that Steven made him do it, and that Steven had touched him (and others) inappropriately in the past.

Mom: What all happened, what are you talking about?

Brendan: About what Me &amp; Steven did that day,

Mom: What about it?

Brendan: Well, Mike &amp; Mark &amp; Matt came up one day and took another interview with me and said because they think I was lying but so, they said if I come out with it that I would have to go to jail for 90 years.
Mom: What?

Brendan: Ya. But if came out with itT would probably get I dunno about like 20 or less. After the interview they told me if I wanted to say something to her family and said that I was sorry for what I did.
Mom: Then Steven did do it.

Brendan: Ya

Mom: (Mom Crying) Why diddn't you tell me about this?

Brendan. Ya, but they came out wi.th something that was untrue with me

Mom:. What's that?

Brendan: They said that I sold crack

...

Mom: So did you talk to her family?

Brendan: No

M: Huh

Brendan: They just asked me if I wanted to say something to them, on the tape.

Mom: Did you?

Brendan: .lust that I was sorry for what I did.

...

Mom: Did he make you do this?
Brendan: Ya.

Mom: Then why didn't you tell him that.

Brendan: Tell him what

Mom: That Steven made you do it. You know he made you do a lot of things.

Brendan: Ya, I told them that. I even told them about Steven touching me and that.

Mom: What do you mean touching you?

Brendan: He would grab me somewhere where I was uncomfortable.

Mom: Brendan I am your mother.

Brendan. Ya.

Mom: Why didn't you come to me? Why didn't you tell me? Was this all before this happened?

Brendan: What do you mean?

Mom: All before this happened, did he touch you before all this stuff happened to you.

Brendan: Ya.

Mom: Why didn't you come to me, because then he would have been gone then and this wouldn't have happened.
Brendan: Ya ..

Mom: Yes, and you would still be here with me.

Brendan: Yes, Well you know I did it.

Mom: Huh

Brendan. You know he always touched us and that.

Mom: I didn't think there. He used to horse around with you guys.

Brendan: Ya, but you remember he would always do stuff to Brian and that.

Mom: What do you mean.

Brendan: Well he would like fake pumping him

Mom: Goofing around

Brendan: Ya but, like that one time when he was going with what's her name Jessica .. sister. 

Mom: Teresa?

Brendan: Ya. That one day when she was over, Steven and Blaine and Brian and I was downstairs and Steven was touching her and that.

-- There's no denying that it was unethical as hell for the investigator of Dassey's own attorney to elicit a confession out of Brendan, but the documentary suggests that the investigator peppered Brendan with leading questions and basically fed him the answers. From the full transcript, that is not the case at all. Brendan not only confessed, he gave a very detailed account of what happened. They had sex with Teresa on the bed, then they carried her out to the garage, where they cut her throat, and that's where Steven shot her five times with the .22 Brendan said he pulled from above his bed. Then they threw her in the fire. She begged for her life through the entire ordeal. Brendan even cut off some of her hair. Then they cleaned up with bleach and burned all the clothes in the bonfire.

The bits and pieces from the interview provided in the series make it seem like Brendan is kind of making it up as he goes along or is being fed answers. The 21-page transcript leaves very little doubt of Brendan's role. But again, Brendan's IQ is 70. He'd been molested by Steven in prior occasions. Basically, Steven forced him to do this, and Brendan wasn't bright enough to say no. He's also not bright enough to make up a story that matches much of the evidence, without being fed the answers.

On the other hand, make no mistake: That was tantamount to a coerced confession. From a legal perspective, the information contained within it was worthless. Brendan would've said anything at this point, and it should've never been admitted at trial. Yet, it was, and to any jury seeing it -- and the specificity of the details -- you might see why they believed Avery and Dassey committed the crime.

Sure it is a hard thing to do but life is hard and doing what's right isn't always easy. Plus they have only had the child exclusively for 1 year, the parents had visitation rights before that and would cry when the REAL parents had to leave.

Reference answer key:

Prime Fedor - Fedor was the best, then got out of Prime. Oh the days of Prime Fedor... He could take Werdum and Cain in one night.

Healthy Shogun - Shogun got injured a lot especially in his late PRIDE early UFC career.

Motivated BJ Penn - Goldberg said this in a BJ GSP fight. 

TRT Vitor - He used to take TRT now he can't. TRT vitor would destroy Weidman.

Chuck ""With that look in his eye"" - Goldberg or Rogain said it before 4 straight fights following Rampage, where he went 1-3

Sea Level Cain - Cain lost to Werdum in Mexico at 10,000 feet. At sea level Cain doesn't gas and Cain wins.

Altitude Werdum - opposite of Cain

Full training camp Weidman - According to /u/Aerocord Chris said in interviews he would FINISH Anderson if he had a full training camp and was a lunatic. He fought Munoz after a full camp. He took the Maia fight on short notice.

Pre Serra GSP - Pre Serra, GSP would not fuckers, After that loss, he started decisioning guys and playing it safe.

Pride Wand - Huge win streak in PRIDE, held belt for many years, GP win. UFC was lackluster.

Cro Cop in a Ring - Cro Cop could cut guys off in the ring and KO them. In the Octagon they could circle out and Cro Cop subsequently lost... A lot.

Focused Guillard - Not sure on this one: After getting off the Coco, had a good run towards a title fight but just came short. This was his focused period. i.e. not on coke. Although

70% Hendricks - He said he fought at 70% or coasted at 70% in the last round vs. GSP and lost the round. Dana scolded him saying he should have fought at 100%. goof.

""Cain Camp"" Cormier - Training with Cain make Cormier a beast.

6 out of 7 Gusstafson - After he lost to Rumble, Gus said he's beat rumble 6 times out of 7, irking Rumble, who was humble.

Properly wrapped Hendricks - In his fight with Robbie, supposedly his wraps weren't right (grapplers wrap? or a poor wrap job, can't remember)

Full training camp Pat Cummings - Cummings fought Cormier on 10 days notice for Rashad and they only gave Cummings the fight because he promised he'd tell the story of how he made Cormier cry in wrestling practice a decade ago. Cummings got murdered. But after a few full camps, beat his next 3 opponents.

Pre-accident Mir - Was Heavyweight champ and had a motorcycle accident and broke his femur in 2004, was out for 2 years, Tim Sylvia was Champ by the time he got back. Mir was never the same. Actually, To be fair, he won the interim later.

Hallway Mir Mir beat Jones in a hallway playfight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xshs_mW86YA  .

Horsemeat Reem - Reem eats Horsemeat, as do many Dutchers.

Pre diverticulities brock - You can't absorb enough nutrients without half your intestines.

Height cutting Carwin - Carwin was listed at 6'3 then when he fought Lesnar but was clearly a lot shorter than legit 6'3 Lesnar. Carwin us now listed at 6'2 but he might be 6'1 or even 6'0.

Mature Mittrione - He's like an old cheese, he's getting better with age.

Serious Silva - Anderson clowned Weidman in the first fight. Serious Silva will knock Chris in the second one... right?

Androstane Silva - Silva got popped for Androstane, a type of steroid.

""Under the right circumstances"" Ronda - She said she'd beat Cain in a fight ""under the right circumstances.""

Broke Cerrone - Cerrone spends his 200k on taxes and luxury goods within a a month or two of his last fight so he needs to fight every 2 months. Fuckin Tax-Man...


Adderall Mir- Mir was granted a therapeutic use exemption by USADA to use adderall before his fight with Arlovski but it was overruled by the NSAC. If only Mir had his adderall he would have gone Ape on Arlovski like the monkey in 2001: A Space Odyssey.",2015-09-11 08:36:12+00:00,cuxq6u5,4.0,t1_cuxgnx6,24028.0,MMA

Yes some of the incoming were given the property of the outgoing, but that still left 1 million people to settle, which was like 15% of the population, many of whom lived in slums. Took decades to settle some of em. The Turkish Christians faced great resentment from the Greeks, as they were thought to be draining resources (oh the irony). 

One great thing that happened was the awesome music the poor Turks produced called Rebetiko. Greeks hated it at because it sounded too Turkish but now the style has melded with Greek. Here is an awesome example of it from a movie about the genre. As you can see it deals with despair and corruption the people faced. But it is just so soulfull.

There were also muslims who lived in places like Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, which was 1/3rd Jewish, 1/3rd Muslim, 1/3rd Christian, and they co-existed remarkably well for centuries. In fact it was known as the second Jerusalem. All the Muslims who had been there for centuries were shipped off during the exchange in the 1920s, and the Jews were all killed in the holocaust. It is nicknamed the City of Ghosts for this very reason. Truly a sad up-rooting of a unique city.

Somehow I found the full pdf of this great book I read most of for a history class http://www.scribd.com/doc/120786809/Mazower-2005-Salonica-City-of-Ghosts#scribd

Salonica is the Muslim name for Thessaloniki.

The exception was in Istanbul, where a small population of Eastern Orthodox were allowed to remain.

Reference answer key:

Prime Fedor - Fedor was the best, then got out of Prime. Oh the days of Prime Fedor... He could take Werdum and Cain in one night.

Healthy Shogun - Shogun got injured a lot especially in his late PRIDE early UFC career.

Motivated BJ Penn - Goldberg said this in a BJ GSP fight. H

TRT Vitor - He used to take TRT now he can't. TRT vitor would destroy Weidman.

Chuck ""With that look in his eye"" - Goldberg or Rogain said it before 4 straight fights following Rampage, where he went 1-3

Sea Level Cain - Cain lost to Werdum in Mexico at 10,000 feet. At sea level Cain doesn't gas and Cain wins.

Altitude Werdum - opposite of Cain

Full training camp Weidman - According to /u/Aerocord Chris said in interviews he would FINISH Anderson if he had a full training camp and was a lunatic. He fought Munoz after a full camp. He took the Maia fight on short notice.

Pre Serra GSP - Pre Serra, GSP would not fuckers, After that loss, he started decisioning guys and playing it safe.

Pride Wand - Huge win streak in PRIDE, held belt for many years, GP win. UFC was lackluster.

Cro Cop in a Ring - Cro Cop could cut guys off in the ring and KO them. In the Octagon they could circle out and Cro Cop subsequently lost... A lot.

Focused Guillard - Not sure on this one: After getting off the Coco, had a good run towards a title fight but just came short. This was his focused period. i.e. not on coke. Although

70% Hendricks - He said he fought at 70% or coasted at 70% in the last round vs. GSP and lost the round. Dana scolded him saying he should have fought at 100%. goof.

""Cain Camp"" Cormier - Training with Cain make Cormier a beast.

6 out of 7 Gusstafson - After he lost to Rumble, Gus said he's beat rumble 6 times out of 7, irking Rumble, who was humble.

Properly wrapped Hendricks - In his fight with Robbie, supposedly his wraps weren't right (grapplers wrap? or a poor wrap job, can't remember)

Full training camp Pat Cummings - Cummings fought Cormier on 10 days notice for Rashad and they only gave Cummings the fight because he promised he'd tell the story of how he made Cormier cry in wrestling practice a decade ago. Cummings got murdered. But after a few full camps, beat his next 3 opponents.

Pre-accident Mir - Was Heavyweight champ and had a motorcycle accident and broke his femur in 2004, was out for 2 years, Tim Sylvia was Champ by the time he got back. Mir was never the same. Actually, To be fair, he won the interim later.

Hallway Mir Mir beat Jones in a hallway playfight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xshs_mW86YA  .

Horsemeat Reem - Reem eats Horsemeat, as do many Dutchers.

Pre diverticulities brock - You can't absorb enough nutrients without half your intestines.

Height cutting Carwin - Carwin was listed at 6'3 then when he fought Lesnar but was clearly a lot shorter than legit 6'3 Lesnar. Carwin us now listed at 6'2 but he might be 6'1 or even 6'0.

Mature Mittrione - He's like an old cheese, he's getting better with age.

Serious Silva - Anderson clowned Weidman in the first fight. Serious Silva will knock Chris in the second one... right?

Androstane Silva - Silva got popped for Androstane, a type of steroid.

""Under the right circumstances"" Ronda - She said she'd beat Cain in a fight ""under the right circumstances.""

Broke Cerrone - Cerrone spends his 200k on taxes and luxury goods within a a month or two of his last fight so he needs to fight every 2 months. Fuckin Tax-Man...

They also screwed Babych. from wiki: Babych sued the Flyers and the team's orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Arthur Bartolozzi, in 2002, claiming that improper medical care for his 1998 foot injury shortened his career. Bartolozzi misdiagnosed the injury as a bone bruise rather than a fracture, and gave Babych painkillers so he could suit up for the first round of the playoffs. Babych claimed for many years that playing through the injury caused permanent damage which prematurely ended his career. Claiming that the Flyers and Bartolozzi had defrauded him, he sued for $2 million in lost wages. The Flyers were dismissed as a defendant before trial when a judge ruled there was no evidence of fraud on their part. While a jury found no evidence of fraud Bartolozzi's part either, it found that he failed to follow accepted standards of care and awarded Babych US$$1.02 million in lost wages and US$350,000 for pain and suffering in November 2002.[2]",2015-07-03 11:29:42+00:00,csqwoc7,3.0,t1_csqppco,23204.0,MMA

3153,"Let me just preface this by saying I am a white (English Swedish descent), atheist, Canadian who has studied Middle East history, as well as recent politics and its relationship with Islam. i.e. not biased towards Islam.

Yes, they are religiously similar, but AQ and ISIS want a theocracy, therefore they want to depose the Saudi Royalty. 

Read about the Grand Mosque seizure where a bunch of extremists seized the holy site and called for the deposing of the Saud Royal Family and you will see why they are wary of extremists groups and extremist clerics. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_seizure

The Saudi Royalty, like he argued, is slowly modernizing, but obviously cannot since their power is dependent on the alliance with Wahhabi clerics and the fact that most people in their country is Wahhabi.

They can, however, choose which clerics they promote and demote, and routinely promote less extreme clerics and get rid of those who promote terrorism.

The Saudi government is walking a fine line but it is obvious they are against terrorism and AQ/ISIS.

Here's a neat book I skimmed a bit of but on page 65 it shows how they are sanctioning and sanctioning clerics based on extremism. http://www.defenddemocracy.org/content/uploads/documents/facebook_fatwa_low_res_2.pdf

Here is also the wiki of a popular cleric who was imprisoned for opposing Saudi Royal family and Rehabilitated to become more peaceful, denouncing Osama's attacks. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_al-Ouda

So the Saudi government is clearly anti-terrorism and for a slow modernization (they might even want to modernize quicker if the clerics and populace wouldn't have a conniption). They want stability to make that sweet oil revenue.

There are TONS of travel journals written in the 1800s, it was a very popular genre as many people couldn't travel. And some are by vary famous people like Dickens. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Notes

These travel journals would talk often about the Sublime (terryfying/astonishing awe), and the picturesque countrysides they'd see on their journey. There is even such a thing as the cult of the sublime, and the cult of the picturesque that arose in the 18th century. https://blantonmuseum.org/files/american_scenery/sublime_guide.pdf

There is a theory that Americans became obsessed with these natural wonders because they did not have magnificent Cathedrals and Castles of Europe. So their objects of revere became things like Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, the Mississippi, Niagara. Their scales were unmatched in Europe.

3213,"Great analysis until the second last line of your post. WTF dude? Nothing in your analysis jives with your prediction. You gave absolutely no reason why Aldo will win this fight fight by TKO. There are definitely more likely outcomes. 

I think you over-thought yourself. Read your analysis again. Connor will likely win by TKO. If Aldo wins. Maybe a decision?

Trust your analysis. If Aldo damages Connor with the leg kicks, will he go in for the finish&gt; No, you said it yourself, he's a counter striker. Connor isn't going for take downs, he's not gunna land a Mendes knee. If Connor gets rocked, he'll keep the range and tag Connor coming in. We also haven't seen McGregors chin show any signs of weakness, and is probably in good shape do to his age and short, dominant performances in the cage.

Will aldo be able to GNP. Probably no Connors TD defense is good and he's good at getting back up.  Aldo hasn't finished elite UFC competition with GNP.

Aldo needs Connors tank to fail for the win. That might be his way to victory, but like you said, there's a decent chance from what we've seen that won't happen, but obviously some unknown here.

I'd say put money on Connor to TKO or Aldo to decision depending on lines (haven't bet yet) but I take Connor straight up. If you feel that Conors opponents were so terrible that none of his multiple strengths will come into play then I'd say bet Aldo decision. But I'm sticking with Connor after much thought.
