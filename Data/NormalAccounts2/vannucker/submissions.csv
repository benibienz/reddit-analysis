Adult Vlad speaks with an Turkish envoy about how his kingdom is paying tribute to the Turks. True? Also the Sultan is requesting more boys.

Also Mehmet and Vlad were supposedly ""like brothers"" when Vlad was hostage. True?

But now Mehmet is requesting more boys and Vlad's son to be raised under his roof.


Anyways: Early review 20 minutes in is that this movie is great just for the costumes and historical pomp even if it is a bunch of hooey and vampires are going to appear.
