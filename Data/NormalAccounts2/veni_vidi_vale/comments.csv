But rather than beat around the bush like many of my fellow audiophiles, I shall try to be more upbeat - the trabeate explanation is that Beats headphones don't deserve their beatific reputation because there are just so many other good headphone models that beat them in sound quality, price, comfort, and design.

So dont follow the beaten path of the general public, instead follow the advice of audiophiles and listen to music with unbeatable sound quality.

tl;dr: when it comes to buying Beats, if you beats them, you don't necessarily have to join them.

good eye, dude

These headphones are crap, mainly because they are not the ""real"" nakamichi. Let me explain.

Nakamichi used to make solid electronics (cassette decks!), including headphones in the 70s/80s. They actually did a deal with Toyota to do audio for Lexus models, but at some point lost out to Harman International (parent corporation of Mark Levinson) .

Sometime in the 1990s Nakamichi went bankrupt. They were bought out by a Chinese company that tried to reposition the brand. They did come out with some cool ideas (like the [Lumos] (http://www.nakamichi.com/pfv/DVD/lumos.htm))  but their headphones are OEMs and are, well, very meh.

The brains behind the old Nakamichi, Niro Nakamichi started a company called Mechanical Research Corporation that came up with some [interesting products] (http://www.stereotimes.com/amp051502.shtml)",2016-11-20 03:56:34+00:00,da7snqm,2.0,t1_da7m693,10831.0,headphones

31,"I bought mine at a much higher price and a second unit as a gift for a crazy price when it was on blowout at Adorama some months ago ($220). 

This deal is not as good as that one, but IMO $300 is the sweet spot for these.

Here is what I said about it after I got my hands on it and listened to it for a while. I still use it all the time either connected to an amp + speakers as a standalone DAC or to a Intel NUC  as a dedicated Spotify listening station for low impedance headphones (when you set it up vertically, the chassis also doubles as a nifty headphone stand).

****

This is a slick DAC/amp combo, with only a few (but probably significant) flaws. 

But first, the construction: it is top notch. Even though the enclosure is mostly plastic, the unit is hefty and weighs more than you think it would. And that ""Denon"" you see is actually an OLED display, which adjusts to whether you have the unit lying flat or standing up. 

Second, it has all the inputs you need (USB, 2 optical - so you can plug in both your PS4 and Xbox One - and coax). It also has RCA line out so you can connect your powered speakers.

At its core is a PCM1795 DAC chip, which means upto 32/192 and DSD compatibility. 

It isn't a neutral amp, though. Although it has tons of details (thanks to its AL32 processing, more about that below), it has what I would describe as a smooth and overall ""inverse-U"" profile, with modestly prominent mids. Denon tuned it for its own headphones, which is fine by me because I usually pair mine with a AHD600 or Q701, because the DA300 serves as my primary gaming DAC (PS4 optical in, Xbone optical in, coax in from computer, RCA out to powered monitors).

Some unique features: the OLED display is very cool. You can place the DA300 either standing up (it comes with its own base plate for vertically mounting it) or traditionally on its side horizontally. The OLED screen automatically figures out the orientation and adjusts. When I first unboxed it, I spent an inordinate amount of time putting it on its side, then upright, then on its side, then upright....you get the idea :-)

 Interestingly, the DA300 has separate output stages for the headphone amp and the line out circuits, and the DAC stage is particularly well designed, IMO. 

It also has a ton of isolator chips (I counted nine of them when I cracked it open) which means zero USB noise and floor noise, even with my most finicky diva headphones.

So what are the flaws? First, *everything* gets up sampled by the DA300, and while this is in theory supposed to improve SQ, it really doesn't, and is more of a gimmick. Second, using AL32 processing to achieve upconversion is another gimmick, IMO, and changes the sound profile so that it's this ""inverse-U"" shape. This is unique and interesting but not really a good match with headphones like the HD650, IMO, because it kills the high end.

And my biggest gripe with the DA300 is that despite all the bells and whistles, the headphone amp lacks muscle, putting out only 50mW at 32 ohms. Which means it struggles to power high impedance headphones, which is surprising because it has 15V DC in, and isn't just USB powered.

Having said this, this deal IMO is spectacular, and an absolute steal. I paid $399 for mine, and I don't regret buying it at that price. I mainly bought it because I was intrigued by the concept of AL32 processing, and it has ended up being a keeper that I use all the time (although probably not as the manufacturer intended!).

For the price of an O2+ODAC you get a *boatload* of features, and looks that will drive you to distraction. If you are willing to accept the flaws I have noted above, IMO the DA300 for $220 is the best deal I have seen in the preceding year, period. And that's saying something.

Edit: for those who are interested, more about AL32 processing [here](http://www.denon.com/pages/GlossaryDetail.aspx?GId=13)

33,"To some extent I think it is the mindset that many (but thankfully not all) hi fi stores operate. Before I tell my story I want to preface it by saying: I have been to plenty of hifi stores where the staff are professional, top notch and completely unbiased.

I have an audiophile friend who happens to be a woman. She lives in one of the largest, most metropolitan cities in the US. She once told me that the most irritating aspect of the hobby for her was when she would walk into a hifi store with her husband and the salesman would focus on her husband rather than her, except when he made the obligatory ""WAF"" jokes.

I used to think she was exaggerating, but a few years ago when I was in town we checked out a well-known (and well respected by the local audiophile community) hifi store together to  check out + listen to some *really* high end gear that we had both drooled over for months. 

The sales guy ignored her completely and focused his entire high-pressure sales pitch on me except for some condescending remarks aimed at her, and when  she asked a technical - and very appropriate - question he rolled his eyes comically and shook his head like he couldn't believe what he was hearing. And then he made a completely crass remark about how it was amazing ""wives sometimes listened to their husbands when they were talking about 'guy' things"" (he must have thought we were married). I was so embarrassed I grabbed my friends arm and pulled her out of the store.

So if you ask me ""Why is the audio field so heavily male dominated?"" I think the better way to phrase the question is ""What makes our hobby so difficult  to enjoy for some folks, especially women?""

And the answer is ""men"".

noone knows because they havent been released to the genral public yet.

My guess is that the build quality will be the same as the HD650 (i.e. excellent) because they are being built by Senn in the same factory

But that's not a guarantee - as we saw, Fostex has a ***lot*** of expereience manufacturing headphones and usually has excellent build quality but they managed to screw up QI for the THX00 purplehearts.

&gt;Cause if its all plasticky and breaks within a couple of years

Just because it is plastic doesn't necessarily mean it has to break in a couple of years (unless it is HifiMan, ba dum tish!). 650s are pretty much all plastic and are built solidly.

But having said that, it should be noted that Sennheiser has had issues with their plastic before - I have a pair of HD555s that have developed cracks like the San Andreas fault, and cracking plastic was a huge issue with 555s and 595s.

We don't have the same feel or content as headfi or SBAF (the other big headphones subs out there), and that's [1] a good thing and [2] a result of the fact that this sub skews a different type of audience. 

Like QuipA said, the folks who answer purchase advice + tech support questions regularly deserve special thanks, because it can often be a thankless job, and the repetitive nature of the questions (and answers!) can quickly lead to burnout.

To be fair, I should also have added that the listening experience also involves variables that simply cannot be accounted for by conventional measuring equipment - for example, individuals have different dimensions to their external auditory canals and angling of their tympanic membrane that induce variations to perceived sound - something that objectivists conveniently neglect to consider.

It's also *expensive* to build up a physical music collection now-a-days, folks often have tens of thousands of songs on their Spotify catalog and can listen to any of them for $10 a month, can you imagine how much it would cost to build up the same collection as CDs?

For me streaming + hard copy (CDs and vinyl) music are complementary. I use Spotify + Tidal to expand my horizons, and since I listen to a *lot* of genres, a streaming service lets me cover a lot of ground.

The ""bio"" in biocellulose is because of the technique - a bacteria called Acetobacter is added to sugar (saccharides) and the bug produces fine chains of cellulose that can be compressed into a sheet, so  ""bio""cellulose.

Biocellulose headphone drivers were ""invented"" because Sony was trying to fool around with new materials for the driver of their new halo flagship headphones at the time, the MDR R10. Some of the guys in the Sony team heard about food scientists at Ajinomoto Corporation (a Japanese company that cornered the artificial MSG market at the time) using a bacteria called Acetobacter to produce ""paper in a vat"" that they could use as food packaging.  They collaborated to build the first biocellulose headphone drivers. In fact the patent holders for biocellulose are Ajinomoto, Sony and Japan's Agency for Industrial Science and Technology. 

But Sony stopped using biocellulose in its drivers after a while, and the technology was taken up by Fostex, who became known for the ""biodyna"" biocellulose drivers for some of their best-loved models like the TH900.

146,"wow you rezd my post from way back when!

The real advantage of oversampling is that it allows more room between the upper limit of the audio spectrum and Nyquist (which is half the frequency of the sampling rate). So if you oversample to 192 kHz your spread is greater than if you oversample to 96 kHz.

The reason this spread is important is because of the way anti-aliasing filters work - the more the spread the better the smoothing. In the old days when antialiasing filters were analog, this was key to maintaining the fidelity of the signal and avoiding issues with intermodulation distortion.

But not all DACs oversample transparently. And that's the problem. Sometimes, the higher the sample rate, the more the ***DAC*** introduces distortion to the signal. In that case, you are probably better off sampling at a lower rate.

To answer /u/Alypax's question: oversampling is good, but not necessarily. If a signal is oversampled to a high rate, all those extra samples don't necessarily add to the audible quality of the sound after a point (what this point is is hotly debated in audiophile circles). But it would be reasonable to say that humans can't tell the difference between a 24bit/192 kHz and 24bit/384 kHz sample, even though the latter has a much greater spread between 20 kHz and Nyquist. As /u/Baldoor-E100 pointed out, the DAC pumping out 384 kHz oversamples has to work much harder than a DAC pumping out 192 kHz oversamples from the same source.

Hope this helps

However, some delays have been so long folks may end up n having to forward delivery of their packages to their retirement homes...or worse :-)

IMO the Fostex drops are jinxed - the mahogany had poor QC (wanna play cable Twister, anyone?) and cosmetic defects due to bad packaging, and now the regular X00 shipment has mysteriously disappeared (I guess someone at UPS waved a wand and said ""*Evanesco*""). 

Having said this, the real issue IMO is MDs poor communication with customers and their inability to keep folks in the loop when things begin to unravel.  They got away with it for a while by saying ""we're small, we're new, we're just a startup"" but its now been ***four years*** now since they opened their doors. And frankly, their protestations of ""we don't have enough staff to update a whole bunch of drops"" does not make sense either because they have succeeded in getting multiple  rounds of funding - and I'm not talking about small change, if memory serves me right their last round of finding in 2015 was something like $40 *million*, mostly from August Capital.

231,"&gt;insane scaling of HD650s

Im not sure by what you mean. Differences in  sound profiles due to pairing headphones with different amps are more 6pm-to-7pm than night-and-day.

&gt; doesn't seem to be what people are talking bout

The primary  reason you hear what you hear  is because of the headphones, which change the sound a certain way. (or not, if they are neutral).

 For example, listening to the same music via the same source with a bright pair of headphones will make the music sound substantially different than listening to thew same music through a pair of dark headphones. Other factors like details, speed and sound staging also affect how the music sounds in your ears.

The amp changes the sound too, in a certain way, but it is more nuanced than how changing headphones affect the sound. For example listening to the same music with the same pair of headphones, the music may sound brighter with a Burson Conductor or warmer with a Woo Audio WA2.

sometimes the way the headphones and amp pair can affect the overall perception of sound in a synergistic way, mainly because our ears are subjective. So folks may be sensitive to pairing, say a HD700 with a Burson Conductor, because what is objectively just a few extra decibels of treble brightness due to combining a bright pair of headphones with a relatively bright amp might sound harsh and jangly to some. 

Matching impedances of headphones with that of the amp may also help improve the way the bass sounds. But again the benefits of impedance matching are nuanced - just by shuffling amp impedances you aren't going to make a 600 ohm Beyer like a 32 ohm Grado.

And finally, ensuring that headphones get the power they deserve also improves the sound profile in an audible way, and some amps can deliver more power than others by design.

&gt;Some say amps beyond a certain power is near nonexistant difference 

power isn't the only criterion to consider

&gt;recommended the schiit stack for HD650s

that's a perfectly acceptable pairing

Pandora is in a somewhat sticky situation. They occasionally show profits but mostly run at a loss - their last profitable quarter was Q3 2015, since then they have shown 3 consecutive quarters of staggering losses ( minus $115 million in Q1 2016). That was bad enough for the Pandora CEO to be fired. 

Part of this is because they have been settling lawsuits with folks who are out to get them - they paid major record companies something like $90 million in 2015..

So it makes sense for Pandora to try something new, IMO they haven't got much to lose at this point.


But while on the one hand a $5 monthly streaming service may be a good thing to shake up the competition, I'm worried about how services like Spotify and Tidal will fare.

The problem with the business model of streaming services like Spotify and Tidal is this: the more subscribers they have, the more music gets streamed, and the more royalties Spotify / Tidal has to pay. If the consumer base is small, then revenue from subscriptions + advertising (for the freebie accounts)  more than covers what they have to pay to record companies, but as the number of folks using their services swells, typically the only way they can make a profit is to charge as much for subscriptions as they can.

Which is why the $5 monthly sub fee is a problem for established streaming services - Jeff Bezos can probably eat a loss of subsidized subscriptions if necessary by betting that even if it is a loss leader it will lead to increased sales of other digital music, but Jay Z may not be able to.

Disclaimer: I have owned shares in both Pandora and AMZN, and have bought CDs by both Jay Z and Bey :-)

I want you to close your eyes and imagine a scenario. 

It's a late summer afternoon, and the dappled sunlight rolls over the green grassy bank of a peaceful lake. Trees are rustling in the breeze, and far out on the lake small boats are bobbing in the waves. You are obviously listening to music on your headphones, since you are an audiophile. Specifically, to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYO3R-vVck), Haydn's flute concerto in D major.

Go on, listen. Can you feel how peaceful the music is, and how naturally the HD650 reproduces the sound of the violins? Or how the HD600 renders the music without coloration or distortion?

And then at [1:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYO3R-vVck&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=76) the flute kicks in. And when I say ""kicks in"", it kicks in like a mule on PCP, a giant wallop of shrill  that cracks your skull and drives a treble spike into your brain. 

Because you, gentle OP, aren't listening with the HD650 or 600, but with the HD700, which makes the high end of the musical spectrum sound like life without parole on Riker's Island.

But it's hard to ignore what is a growing trend. Yes part of Apple's design considerations may have been influenced by the need to shave yet more microns off the thickness of the latest iPhone, but there is also good data that suggests the majority of normal folk (i.e. non-audiophiles) prefer convenience to sound quality. 

A recent report from NPD (big retail intelligence firm) shows that headphone sales continue to grow dramatically, but for the first time this year sales of bluetooth headphones were greater than the sales of *all* wired headphones. And this trend will only continue to rise.

315,"Three thoughts.

One, this sub skews a younger audience than other traditional audiophile subs. Heck, all of reddit is skewed towards a young audience. Now personally I think that's a good thing, because audiophiles are a dying species and we need fresh blood to avoid extinction. But that also means you have a bunch of folks on the sub with smaller discretionary incomes and the inability to buy / audition high-end audio gear.

Second, there's a small group of objectivists who crap on *everything* that is expensive because there is no real objective evidence that, say a $2000 DAC sounds any different than a $100 DAC.  I get where they are coming from, but as most folks who have been in this hobby for a while will tell you, graphs don't tell the whole story. And the upper levels of audiophilia is absolutely dominated by subjectivists, not objectivists. Again, I think age and expertise has a significant role to play, Most objectivists are younger and engineers / students, while most folks who spend tens of thousands of dollars in this hobby (or hundreds of thousands of dollars!) are older and ""gentlemen audiophiles"" without a technical background.

Plus I suspect a lot of the hardcore objectivists in this sub haven't really spent a lot of time auditioning TOTL gear, especially speakers and amps - that crowd tends to be snooty and exclusive, and there's no way they will let a 20something objectivist into their audio country club.

And third, there's always a tendency for folks to rebel against the ostentatious display of wealth. Historically, this disparity between the haves and the have nots has *always* led to friction. The French revolution, Russia in the early 20th century, etc. The class struggle in audiophilia is real :-)

And Stax Lambdas first came out in 1979. Beyer DT880s have been around in one form or another since 1980. AKG K240s have been around since the 70s too and production only stopped in 2006.

Many people think of Grado when they think of headphones that have been around for ever, but if memory serves me right the SR60/80 were first released in the early-mid 90s. They were preceded by the SR100, 200 and 300 that were released in 1991.

343,"IMO well fitted ciem &gt; good anc

however, two caveats. First, anc is great at isolating continuous monotonal sounds, for example the drone of aircraft engines, but not so good at isolating sudden sharp bursts of sound, for example when the guy sitting next to you on the plane coughs. Passive attenuation with CIEMs is good for both.

The key though is comfort. Well fitted CIEMs slip into your ears and you don't know you have them on, but a *lot* of folks are walking around with CIEMs that dont fit perfectly, or their inner ear canal dimensions change over time, or they build up wax and sweat between their skin and the CIEM shell, and so after a while wearing CIEMs can be fatiguing. For a long plane flight, over-ear headphones may actually be more comfortable and easier to tolerate than IEMs.

And finally, not all ANC headphones are created equal. Bose has great ANC. I can think of many othe brands where the ANC is sub par. But almost all CIEMs, no matter what the brand, will  deliver similar levels of passive isolation.",2016-09-03 16:45:55+00:00,d784otb,1.0,t3_50yr0g,12642.0,headphones

Keep in mind that counting the number of bars on a phone's scale may not objectively reflect the intensity or loudness of sound exposure.

Its actually a reasonable option for someone looking for a well-built closed pair of headphones without the super bass prominence that characterizes many other closed entry-fi headphones.

But folks, despite Zeos typically glowing review, lets not get carried away by hypemongering. The M40x has its fair share of flaws. Let me enumerate them:

The treble is a little rough and can be brittle at times. Sibilance can be an issue for some. Soundstage is narrow (while that's to be expected, it's a little too narrow even for folks whose expectations are low). Clamping force is just as monstrous as the M50x. Pads are a little thin (but you can fix that by swapping HM5 or DT250 pads).

370,"&gt;  DP-X1

I did a side-by-side of the SPX1 and the XDP100 before going with the Pioneer over the Onkyo primarily because I didnt want a dual DAC or balanced configuration. I'll explain why.

First, I dont take super expensive IEMs on the road with me, mainly because I have lost quite a few. My usual ""travel kit"" now-a-days is a SE535 with sensaphonic sleeves (because sometimes I feel like a nut, and sometimes I dont) and usually a second IEM with an inline mic/remote in case I'm taking calls.

Sometimes when I'm feeling adventurous I take my 846 on the road, but I have made a conscious effort not to take anything more expensive than the 535s with me after I almost lost my 846 - I accidentally left it on a plane when I made my connection and a wonderful United flight attendant actually ran across the concourse with it so that she could give it to me before I boarded my next flight.

I'm now on my third pair of 535s having lost the previous two when traveling, which tells you how absent minded I am...

And second, apart from the inevitable depression that will set in if I lose the more expensive DPX1, the primary reason I chose the XDP100 is because I don't think you need a balanced setup when on the road. Airports and airplanes (and trains and buses and cars) aren't really ideal listening environments, and I don't think there is any real advantage to rocking a balanced setup when on the road.  I'm not really in the mood for critical listening on a long flight as much as I want to drown out most of the ambient noise and catch up on my Spotify playlists while I get some work done. 

Plus, the best thing about wearing IEMs on long flights is that you can always use them as an excuse not talk to the person sitting next to you :-)

372,"it runs Android Lollipop (5.1.1 I think, I can check if you like) with some tweaks. Home screen scrolling is fast and smooth, apps start up just like my phone

I like Pioneer's music player app, I use it for onboard files (I loaded up a ton of songs on the dual microSDs). I also use Pioneer's XDAP for Windows to manage  my transfers from PC to XDP100.

It came with Tidal and Spotify apps preinstalled, if memory serves me right. Google Play store is on the device, but I don't remember downloading the apps when I unboxed the XDP100. I subscribe to both, but pretty much only use Spotify on the go, because I have a bunch of playlists lined up for offline use: it just takes a few minutes to go ""out with the old, in with the new"" when I have access to wifi and hey presto I have a whole new set of songs I wanted to listen to and I'm good to go.

It came preloaded with other bloatware apps that i got rid of (OnkyoMusic, for example). I only have a few apps on the XDP100 apart from streaming services + music player (like Audible, Flightaware, NYT) so I havent really stressed it to see if it becomes sluggish with multiple things running at once. I dont play games on it, mainly because the screen isnt as good as my phone.

tl;dr UI is like any typical android phone. Pioneer music player is great. Compared to the crappy Fiio DAP interface this is 2 to the power 64 times better (sorry, I'm playing No Mans Sky right now and couldn't help myself) :-)

Edit: I should also say, I havent owned an iphone in years. I weaned myself off the apple ecosystem a long time ago and have no intention of going back. If I had a 6S, would I have bought the XDP100? I honestly don't know, but I suspect the answer is ""yes"". Its a bit more painful to run the XDP100 as your daily music driver if you are only consuming music from itunes, though

And they can certainly do a better job of communicating with players post-release than they have been (silence is not always golden!)

But I think the more fundamental issue with this game is that NMS *players* have a huge amount of expectation bias, and it has been fueled by some of the more rabid posts on forums like reddit and on youtube.

I don't think of NMS as a FPS or a space sim or a 4X game. I think of it as a casual game, a game where I can kick off my shoes and veg in front of my screen with 65daysofstatic's awesome soundtrack in my ears and zone out to the psychedelic colors and repetitive actions.  Yes it may be be ""a mile wide and an inch deep"", but NMS sure is a great way to unwind.

OP like you I preordered the game and took a day off work on day 1. And like you I haven't ejected the disc from my PS4 yet, because I enjoy it a lot, despite its flaws.

But unlike you I'm not too confident that HG can actually fix the game at this point to meet fan expectations.  Hype is like cancer - it metastasizes rapidly and can rapidly cause a *lot* of damage. And this game had a lot of hype riding the internet before release.

NMS is a great place to start, and puts other game studios on notice, but after the usual round of bugfixes and modest DLC offerings, I think HG is probably better off learning from the experience and moving on to NMS2.

Personally, i think it's a glitch in the way the game seeds starting planet locations. If new players spawned, say 5K light years from each other, then perhaps interactions would be much less common.

There is of course one other alternative, and I'm surprised no-one has brought it up before: what if the universe is actually *much smaller* than what we have been told - not 10E19 planets but say just a couple of million procedurally generated planets? In that case, encounters would be extremely common - just as they are now.",2016-08-26 23:00:41+00:00,d6y5rv7,1.0,t3_4zrcf7,1065.0,NoMansSkyTheGame

453,"I love Marquez's *Danzon No 2*. It's whimsical and yet majestic, and the syncopated varying rhythms are an excellent counterpoint to the instruments in a truly magnificent way. Plus it's a great piece for critical listening and testing gear because the orchestra goes back-and-forth with solos for the violin, clarinet, oboe, picollo, piano and trumpet, so you get a whole sweep of tonal variations and dynamic instrument ranges that help pinpoint both natural tonal reproduction as well as soundstage in a sophisticated fashion.

The piece was written by Marquez in the mid 90s at the request of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, and it remained relatively unknown until the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela under Gustavo Dudamel toured Europe in 2007. I was fortunate to be able to hear Danzon No 2 when it first premiered at the BBC proms that year (that was truly a memorable vacation, I heard two weeks of wonderful music pretty much *every single day* I was there!)

OP Pictures would help

Tenco was an OEM brand of a Japanese company in the 70s/80s that exported cheap electronics including headphones and microphones into the US and canadian market, also under brands such as ""Lancer"" or ""Maeden Sound"". The ""Tenco"" brand was known more for car audio parts than for home hi fi.

In the 70-s/early 80s, Japanese companies didn't command the premium cache they do today. Instead, Japanese products were typically cheap, bottom-of-the-barrel items intended for the discount market, and you would often find off-branded Japanese electronics in bargain stores like Sears and Kmart

in those days US consumers would often look at the ""Made In Japan"" label in the same way as they look at ""Made In China"" labels today. 

Maeden Sound went belly up a long time ago. There is currently a Chinese company called Maeden that makes speaker wire, but they have nothing to do with vintage Maeden.

normal to have some ringing after super loud noise exposure. Ringing indicates potential hearing damage, but it is impossible to say if noise inducved hearing loss is temporary or permanent - it really depends on how loud and how long the exposure was. For example, 100 dB exposure can cause permanent hearing loss in 15 minutes and 120 dB can cause almost immediate hearing loss.

If you are worried that you may have damaged your hearing, then get an audiologist to test your ears!

513,"I think of the TH900 as the endgame headphone for the *anti-objectivist*. It's not neutral by any means with a v-shaped profile that makes the purists rage in disdain and create troll accounts on reddit just to rage some more.

I like its immensely satisfying low end a lot though, and its soundstaging is excellent for closed headphones. And dat urushi reminds me of Dave Bowman in 2001ASO ""*my god its full of stars*""...

With all the competetion that is readily available today, at $1500 the TH900 is hard to justify (except maybe as a work of art) but at $1000 it becomes easy to live with, especially if you are a fan of EDM.

520,"I like this game, although it puzzled me a little when I started playing - what kind of game is it?

At its core, IMO NMS isn't a 4X game. Or a space simulator. It isn't really even a traditional space trader or combat game. And although exploration is key, it isn't really a true space-ex game. And it's not a ""find Waldo with a scanner"" game, even though you often feel it is, when the one species you haven't identified is more endangered than the dodo or the great auk. And even though you do a lot of mining, that activity isn't the definitive core of the game either.

So what is NMS?

Instead, I think NMS is the ultimate casual game. Yes I know its incredibly repetitive and limited in scope but I find the rinse-and-repeat gameplay strangely soothing. It's not cerebral by any means (even the puzzles are simple) but it's low challenge level means that you can easily play it while listening to some good music on Spotify and just zone out to the golden-age-of-sci-fi vibe.

In fact, I haven't played any of my usual go-to casual games since I got my hands on NMS on launch day, and that's saying something.

nice choice! 

I played today with decent headphones too (Senn HD800) just to confirm what I suspected from day 1 - it's not just the drums, there are many instances where the game sound is more distorted than it ever needs to be, there's audible clipping of some samples, and positional cues are often just off enough to make things sound uncomfortably artificial. I suspect it has to do with the ""procedural"" nature of the sound - while the intent to randomly connect samples was good, it sounds like the process by which samples were normalized to get them to mesh and flow together in sequence also distorted some of them.

But there is one silver lining - I was standing on a cliff today on this lush planet and the wind noise around me was *awesome*! For a moment I thought my headphones would get blown off :-)

604,"&gt; whether you know it or not - are applying ""snobbery"" to the term audiophile, and I kindly ask you to refrain from that.

Well said. But for ***decades*** audiophiles have been traditionally perceived as snobs (even if that's not always true), which has hurt the hobby substantially. Today, the number of audiophiles is fast dwindling, mainly because many bricks-and-mortar hi fi stores and specialist magazines and internet forums have, to a significant extent, not  done a good job of catering to millennials (heck, I know some hi fi stores that don't even cater well to gen X customers). That's typically what is perceived as 'audiophile snobbery"" by members of the public.

but let's keep in mind - today's fresh-faced enthusiast on reddit buying their first ""quality"" gear that happens to be low-end or mid-fi by traditional audiophile standards is the same enthusiast whose discretionary income grows over the next decade to be able to afford some really wonderful-sounding gear.

But no longer. For around that price point, you can choose one of many low-cost IEMs that meet your needs - for example, if you want reasonably solid bass then the JVC HAFX101 beats the RX18P, there are a bunch of Chi-fi IEM options that have halfway decent sound quality (like the non-fake Xiaomi pistons), and instead of ""shelling"" out big bucks, you can now even buy super cheap IEMs with filters that let you tune the way it sounds, like the KZED9. 

Some low-end Chi-fi IEMs even have reasonably good build quality (like the Yinjw IE800) and won't fall apart like older generation Chi-fi IEMs that cost 10x more  (RE400 I'm looking at you!).

tl;dr: if you had asked a few years ago, I would have said yep the RX18P is worth $10, but now that the Ch-fi flood is upon us, I would say no, the RX18P isn't really my first choice if I had $10 to burn.",2016-07-31 16:00:36+00:00,d5yev73,3.0,t1_d5yea4x,979.0,headphones

713,"^ agree with this

As with all subs on reddit, you get a bunch of shitposts and spam all the time, but ""good quality"" posts are cyclic. I know this for a fact because I have to prune the weeds. 

And it seems folks asking silly or easily-answered-if-you-only-knew-how-to-google questions also post in batches. Some days you see a bunch of decent posts clustered together, and some days the sub main page looks like s schiit stack.  And after every Prime day or black friday you get a flood of posts about the deal-of-the-day (HD598SE, and going back before that, the X1, the M50, the MDRV6). 

That's just how reddit works. The model for this website does not promote deep intellectual conversations, it is a populist site where shallow themes come and go (and often return) on a regular basis. I mean, just look at /r/all - the most upvoted post on the entire site right now is ""*Norway considers giving mountain to Finland as 100th birthday present*. Now that's not very deep, but it sure is tall......

The two most common questions I get PMd about changing the format of this sub are:

first, can we limit posts in this sub to TOTL gear and exclude all the low end crap? Well I don't want to, because reddit skews a much younger crowd than other personal audio forums, and that is it's biggest attraction - traditional audiophiles are a dying breed, and today's budding audiophile who buys his first ""big"" audio purchase, say the HD600, after hanging out at /r/headphones is also probably the same guy who, 20 years later, will have enough discretionary $$$ to throw down at a pair of magnepan 20.7s.

Second, i get asked if we can limit posts to those who espouse purely subjectivist ideals, or I get asked by an irate objectivist if the sub can favor folks who approach their hobby purely from a scientific perspective. My answer to both camps is the same - well no, because you can't have a ying without a yang, and this hobby is big enough for both camps. 


One of the reasons I like this sub is because it ***isn't*** exclusionary or elitist or snobbish or clique-riddled or hype-driven or clannish or looks down on everyone who isn't an insider or riddled with magical thinking or agenda-heavy.

Plus the mods here won't ban you just for expressing your opinion, and actually try hard *not* to act in a high-handed way unless you blatantly break the rules (I know this for a fact because, well, I can).

&gt;/r/audiophile seems to have improved in the past month

/r/audiophile and /r/headphones share the same mods (pretty much) and so have the same formula for moderating. The reason OP is seeing better quality posts in /r/audiophile is because that sub is going through its waxing phase. But soon it too will wane, and then wax, and then...oh you get the idea.

I have a Manley skipjack I use for A/Bing, and a decent decibel meter to equalize gain, but then I'm still using my ears (and my subjective opinion) to draw conclusions. It's the step that many hardcore objectivists simply don't account for - the subjectivity of their objectiveness.  Similarly many hardcore subjectivists IMO place way too much emphasis on pseudoscience and magical thinking to be truly subjective in the qualitative sense of the word.

And you don't necessarily have to spend a ton of money on decent headphones at Akiba.

And heck, you'll save enough money compared to the P3 to spend on other things in Akiba, like Mandarake or Gundam Cafe.

If you don't mind IEMs, when you are at Yodabashi check out the JVC HA-FXT200 and HA-FXT200LTD. They are in your budget and IMO great for bands like Rammstein and Senses Fail.

790,"In 1968 Mike and Peter Giles (siblings) and Robert Fripp formed a band (which they named *Giles, Giles and Fripp* in a display of monstrous originality). The story is that the brothers Giles put an ad out for a keyboard player, and Fripp was the only one who responded. So even though he wasn't a keyboard player, they hired him.

They recorded one tongue-in-cheek album (* The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp*) before Fripp and Ian McDonald (who played winds on the album) split and went on to form the band that arguably heralded the prog rock scene - King Crimson.

Fripp claimed that the album sold only 500 copies, but over the last 40+ years it has become a collector's item and a cult classic. If you are listening critically, note the spaced out imaging that was prevalent at the time, the trombones punctuating the song, Fripp's guitar solo (a portent of things to come!) and Peter Giles' tight harmonics.

As with any vintage classic, there are a thousand releases of the album, and they all have different covers and provenances. I have the Deram vinyl version from 1976 which was released with King Records in Japan (although I found it in a record store in the US, go figure!)  but there are other versions with extra bonus tracks, and single versions of songs in the original album sound different (for example the single version of *North Meadow* features a clarinet track by Ian McDonald that the album version doesn't have). The definitive version is probably the Deram CD with all the bonus tracks.

Fripp has jealously protected the availability of King Crimson content is online (KC isn't on most streaming services, for example) but you can find *The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp* on Spotify, if you want to head back to the swingin' sixties for a while.",2016-07-23 15:38:07+00:00,d5noxqw,1.0,t3_4u8lh7,1263.0,audiophilemusic

797,"&gt; speakers are better.

Headphones give you intimacy that speakers often can't. Speakers give you soundstage that headphones can only dream of delivering. 

At lower price points - say under $1500 , but thats my personal arbitrary cutoff point and not scientific in any way - good headphones often provide a better listening experience than cheap speakers (with some notable exceptions). But over that price point, average audiophile speakers begin to beat good headphones.

That's why I don't own a HE1000 or an Abyss - there is no way I would spend that kind of money on headphones rather than on speakers.

And TBH over time my personal trend (and I suspect that of pretty much everyone else who think of themselves as an audiophile) has been to listen to more and more music on speakers and less and less music on headphones. 

IMO unless you live in a monastery where folks have taken a vow of silence or you are incarcerated in a prison or your abode is a tiny apartment in a huge high rise surrounded by hostile neighbors or you are unfortunate enough to have a WAF of exactly, well, zero, as your discretionary income increases it gets exponentially harder to justify enough good reasons to buy headphones over speakers.",2016-07-21 03:49:04+00:00,d5kjcw9,3.0,t1_d5kj03r,623.0,headphones

840,"I wouldnt go as far as to say they are scams

But IMO folks who sign up for IGG/kickstarter campaigns need to be aware of 2 facts

first - there's a reason you see so many ""revolutionary products"" on IGG/kickstarter.  because it's easier and less hassle to get funding via crowdsourcing than through traditional channels like financial institutions and VC.  All you have to do is write a couple of pages of copy and shoot a video, and you are good to go.  Institutions want to examine things like business plans, and check  the  *credibility* and *facts* associated with any new product and the people behind them in a very thorough way before making investments, but the average Joe Public does not.

second - when you buy a new product from an established company (say a new model from Senn or AKG, for example) you are buying a product where R&amp;D and prototyping is complete, and typically product stockpiles already exist in warehouses. When you sign up for an IGG/kickstarter campaign, most times the product is still vaporware or at a rough prototype stage, and what you (and other backers) are essentially paying for is the cost of bringing the product to market (the riskiest step). there is no guarantee that you'll get what you order, or that you won't be the victim of a bait-and-switch.

Plus, like /u/MrEleventy said, crowdsourcing appeals to folks because they can attract the gullible. Case in point, [this dude got $55,000 on Kickstarter to make potato salad](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad).

tl;dr: caveat emptor. Kickstarter/IGG isn't a ""shure"" thing, and anyone with ""senn""se will understand that these projects are associated with unusually high levels of risk.

Disclaimer: I have backed quite a few kickstarter/ IGG projects. But I do my research before spending my money,  I know what I am letting myself in for, and I have no unrealistic expectations.

Because it isn't that common anymore to find stuff that is ""made in the USA"". There used to be a time when US was a world leader in manufacturing, but then things changed, and two disruptive phenomena decimated US manufacturing. 

First, other countries began to produce products that had just as good, if not better quality than stuff made in the US. 

And second, for decades US companies systematically engaged in the practice of increasing their profits by cutting costs using the strategy of outsourcing their manufacturing to countries where labor costs were cheaper.

844,"these are not traditional electrostatic headphones (like stax) - they are hybrid headphones with a regular dynamic driver plus an electret driver in each cup

difference between electret and electrostatic - electret diaphgrams are pre-charged and don't need a step up transformer to work. They were developed in the 60s/70s as cheap alternatives to traditional electrostatic setups. The most common use of an electret diaphragm was as microphones for telephones.

With respect to the Bravo headphones, as usual the IGG campaign is long on hype and short on any meaningful details - no frequency response curve, no information on how the crossover between the 2 drivers is implemented (if it is one). It sounds like the dynamic driver will do much of the heavy lifting, I have no idea if the electret driver is active across the spectrum or just used for high-end augmentation.

The only real numbers that they cite is ""Get the best range of sound (up to 45 KHz)"". That's great, especially if my dog is listening to the headphones, because I sure can't hear up to 45 KHz.

5. Get to know if there is a local enthusiast club or group in your neck of the woods.

This song is from Netrebko's *Souvenirs* album, and it is simply spectacular from beginning to end.  [Here's a video of the recording session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u0M4CMq7uI).

Les contes d'Hoffman (The tales of Hoffman) is an interesting opera. It's based on semi-autobiographical stories written by E T A Hoffman, who was this super interesting dude who wrote music and stories and drew cartoons when he was working as a bureaucrat in Prussia  in the 18th century. Obviously drawing political cartoons in a militaristic monarchy like Prussia was a bad idea, and sure enough Hoffman was exiled from berlin and ended up in Warsaw, where he was unlucky enough to be living when Napoleon's French troops  captured the town. They promptly deported him back to Berlin, where he died of syphilis in his 40s.

But I digress. The reason Le Contes d'Hoffman is interesting is because Offenbach delayed finishing it as long as he could, since he was convinced that he would die when it was done. And sure enough, he did, with the manuscript clutched in his hands just after completing it.

It's not really a symphony, but a tone poem of 22 themes joined together - you know, like a DJ continuous mix except it was first performed in 1915, and with an orchestra. It's Strauss' way of describing a day climbing a mountain in the Alps.

I couldn't find a full version of the version i wanted to post, so here's an excerpt - the ""Sunrise"" theme, which is the second theme in the tone poem. This version is by the Philadelphia Orchestra, and conducted by Charles Dutoit, who was the orchestra's musical director in the 90s, and continue to conduct their summer festival performance until just a few years ago. He is Swiss and thus obviously knows a thing or two about the Alps. IMO this version is better, both artistically and technically, than the more famous recording by von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic (which is famous because it was one of the first recordings to be released as a CD).

I bought my copy of the Philadelphia Orchestra + Dutoit version from [HD Tracks](http://www.hdtracks.com/strauss-an-alpine-symphony).

890,"Here's what I had to say about ASIO in the past:

There really isn't a problem with Windows sound anymore. Let me explain.

There was a time when windows sound drivers sucked. Big time. That's the reason why ASIO was popularized, to get away from the crappy Windows Kmixer kernel that mangled sound like a testicular vice and had more latency than Bill Cosby's statute of limitations.

Steinberg developed ASIO (Audio stream I/O) to bypass the truly terrible Windows NT 5.x Kmixer kernel. When ASIO was released the pro audio community jumped on ASIO not only because it was capable of direct bit perfect delivery, but also because it supported 24 bit sampling (Win only managed a max of 16 bit at the time).

But Windows has come a long way since the days of Kmixer, which was discontinued for the Win Vista release. Since vista, windows has implemented an entirely new audio stack protocol, and kmixer is gone. WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) and WaveRT are spectacularly superior in comparison to kmixer, and better technology than ASIO.

Kmixer also had a terrible tendency to cause massive clipping at high volumes, and this is again another problem that has been addressed very well in subsequent stack protocol implementations (vista, 7, and now 8 and 10)

But folks still cling to ASIO like it magically transforms the audio stream into something, well, magical, and audiophile forums still tout ASIO like it is the driver equivalent of solid silver cables. Yes, its a reasonable option if you are using DAWs (for example I still use ASIO at times with my FL Studio, but thats not because of SQ but because of convenience). For routine music listening, it is probably easier to use win audio stack if you have win 7/8 rather than ASIO.

And people seem to have forgotten how clunky ASIO really is. Even the touted ""bitrate advantage"" of ASIO is no advantage at all. In windows 7 and above, all system sounds that are resampled to whatever setting you set in the output device sample rate.

If you A/B ASIO vs win audio stack or WASAPI exclusive mode and think ASIO sounds significantly better, you are demonstrating expectation bias, IMO. Either that or you believe in unicorns and the Easter bunny.

If you must run foobar on an exclusive mode (because you don't want to be distracted by system sounds, for example), then run WASAPI.

What does WASAPI do? To put it simply, think of WASAPI as a pipe -- a way for an application (such as Foobar) to manage the flow of data between itself and an end-device (such as an external DAC). This bypasses the Windows Direct Sound drivers, and disables extraneous system sounds when you are listening to music. More here

So what's the huge advantage in running wasapi or asio over native windows drivers? Well, that's a good question, and the answer is ""not much"".

IMO the only advantage of using an external driver is this: if you don't want irritating system noises when you are listening why then wasapi exclusive mode bypasses them.

tl;dr: Stick to Win 7/8/10 native sound, unless your application does not support it. ASIO is so 20th century :-)",2016-07-13 15:56:00+00:00,d5apjvv,6.0,t1_d5aphhw,83.0,headphones

windows handles bit depth and sample rate difffernetly

win 7/8/10 audio stack automatically upsamples the signal to 32 bit floating point depth, and feeds your sound card the highest bit depth the receiving chip can handle. You can adjust the output bit depth in preferences (16 or 24) but the audio stack still internally processes at 32 bit depth (upconverted from whatever bir depth your source is at) and then downconverts to the bit depth you specify before passing the stream on to the audio device.

Hifiman is not known for their QC, and this is something that *everyone* who researches their brand before buying quickly realizes.

So then the obvious question is: if their QC is crap, why does Hifiman have such a loyal fanboy following? In order to understand this phenomenon, we have to step into the past, to a time when ""good sound quality"" was equated with ""horrendously overinflated price"". That's when Hifiman entered the market, and they offered headphones that were cheaper than the competion and sounded good. This quickly led to significant word-of-mouth recommendations at head-fi, and the momentum from head-fi generated sales propeled their business for their early years. Plus they released a cult classic (HE6) at exactly the right time. They also capitalized on the headfi wave very cleverly by becoming sponsors, and converting a lot o their unofficial hype into official hype.

And Hifiman understands the aspirations of budding audiophiles very well. As folks desired to upgrade from their basic Hifiman models, they were ready with new products higher up the audiophile ladder, so they generated a model lineup that made it easy for folks to maintain brand loyalty while traveling up the audio ladder (this model is also very successfully used by Schiit).

But the bottom line is: Fang owes a *lot* of his success to Jude.

962,"&gt;in the future years/decades, what is the possibility that some format will be a lot better than FLAC

just a few decades ago, folks were listening to music on 8-track magnetic tapes.  I can pretty much guarantee you that in a few decades flac will be just as obsolete as 8-track tapes are today.

It's interesting that most folks will argue that the sound quality of digital flac files are better than the sound quality of cassette tapes, but consider this: if you record a song that's on a cassette digitally and reproduce it as a flac file, it will still sound as crappy as the TDK C-90 cassette you recorded it from.

That's why I'm not really that excited by digital file formats of the future. What I'm really excited by is the *sound recording* technology of the future. Can you imagine just how good a well-recorded symphony will sound in a few decades?

Or maybe the loudness war has been irrevocably lost after all and everything will be compressed even more in the future than it is today. Who knows?

Folks quote the Consumerist article (and another one on Gizmodo) like it was a peer reviewed scientific paper, but in reality this was no scientific test published in a technical paper. This was some dude posting on a forum (Audioholics) that his alleged brother was an alleged audio engineering whiz and that they had apparently conducted some kind of quasi-experiment that a 12 year-old would understand does not have any genuine scientific methodology, where they concluded that coat hanger wires were just as good as expensive cables. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe the mumbo-jumbo pseudo-science bullshit that high end cable manufacturers spew online claiming to be ""scientific proof"" for their crackpot theories. But I also get weary of folks quoting a random online forum post from some anonymous dude as absolute evidence of the null hypothesis.

The funny thing is that this story has been circulating as absolute fact since the mid 2000s. If I had $1 for every time I have heard ""coat hanger"" equated with ""proof"" I could probably buy me some Audioquests. Or some Siltech Emperors.

1011,"&gt;what would those better alternatives be sharing a similar price?

it really depends on what kind of sound you are looking for, and whether you want open or closed headphones. The $400-800 price point is now crowded with viable contenders.

I think that the EL8 was an attempt by Audeze to increase their retail presence rather than focus on creating a better sounding pair of headphones. 

More specifically, I think Audeze was trying to [1] hook up with a major design house, in this case BMW Design Works, who have an impressive portfolio of industrial design - from cars (BMW X series) to phones (ZTE Axon7) to computer peripherals (Tt Level 10) to bobsleds for olympic teams (I kid you not). 

Having Designworks create the EL8 gave Audeze the ""street cred"" to [2] hook up with design-conscious retailers, like Apple. 

tl;dr IMO their plan with the EL8 was to get their products into boutique retail (as opposed to boutique audio) stores  - i.e. the Apple store, not necessarily make a cheaper LCD2.

For starters, if that Mullard is a NOS, consider swapping it with a more neutral-sounding tube (and if the Mullard is actually a ""Made in Russia"" reissue, then get rid of it faster than taylor Swift got rid of Calvin harris, because it's a new sensor abomination).",2016-06-20 04:16:20+00:00,d4g8w16,3.0,t1_d4g8k58,571.0,headphones

1042,"&gt;Bottlehead Crack and Speedball vs Woo Audio WA7

IMO comparing crack and wa7 is actually tougher than it seems because you aren't quite comparing apples to apples. Keep in mind that Crack is OTL and has a different topology than the WA7, which is output transformer coupled.

First, the Crack can sound very different depending on how it is set up. Out of the box with stock tubes, it can certainly be described as warm and lush, but the sound audibly tightens up with the speedball upgrade and assumes a cleaner profile.  Crack sound also changes significantly with tube choices - for example my favorite input tube for the crack is the CV4003 - I have the Brimar version, but there are also 4003s you can find stamped ""BVA"" (British Valve Association) which were also typically made by Brimar. It adds a lot of warmth and character, especially to the low end. I also like the NOS Amperex ECC82 (with long plates). With respect to output tubes, again you can alter the sound somewhat by rolling tubes, my favorite is the Mullard CV2984 which really makes the crack sound super lush, although at the cost of detail and treble extension. It's an addictive, analog-ey sound though that can't be beat (but IMO not worth it if you went to the trouble of speedballing, though)

The transformer coupled WA7 has a  sound that is more crystalline than the crack (and I use the term ""crystalline"" in the  true Gordon Holt sense of the word and not lightly like the folks over at head fi throw it around, i.e. free of texturing and veiling) with tighter, more immediate bass. There are also very few tube rolling options for the WA7. Personally after much auditioning I went with the stock tubes and declined the tube power supply. I can't pair my finicky supersensitive IEMs with the Crack but the WA7 has zero floor noise with pretty much everything I have thrown at it. With respect to sound, if you are looking for gooey warm tubey sound, then IMO the WA7 isn't for you. It isn't entirely neutral either. I have previously described WA7 sound in one word: ""clean"", and I think that says it very well.

tl;dr: Personally, I think the Crack is audibly more satisfying, and certainly it was very satisfying to build, while the WA7 is [visually](http://i.imgur.com/9oEJ0Gt.jpg) one of the most satisfying electronic gear purchases I have made.",2016-06-20 03:59:44+00:00,d4g8azq,1.0,t3_4ow66u,10323.0,headphones

The stx is actually a decent option by ""audiophile"" standards -- it has many components that would be considered audiophile grade, for example swappable opamps, nichicon caps, etc.

But if your computer generates lots of EMI, then getting away from an internal sound option may be the only way to get rid of noise, even if the sound card is shielded (like the STX).

And if you want a portable option, then obviously the STX isn't going to cut it.

But the main reason I don't have an add-on sound card in my computer is because I don't have space for it, thanks to my video cards. If I were to go the sound card route, IMO the STX would be a perfectly acceptable option.

If you are using a STX you are probably better off downloading card-specific drivers from Asus than relying on your motherboard realtek drivers.

Companies offer free in-warranty service because warranty service costs are typically built into a product's pricing model.

1091,"Here's what I said to /u/rextos on the topic of LD3 vs LD2

LD3 has a better-built toroid (which affects output power a little depending on which power tubes you use), better stock tubes (LD2 comes with Chinese 6J1s + 6N6s, both of which are crap and you will probably end up never using them after you get a decent pair to swap them with), a better case - not that looks make a huge difference but the LD3 looks more polished, the LD2 looks more DIY. Also, some of the components (like the pot, the rubycon caps and the headphone jack) are of better quality in the LD3 compared to the stuff in the LD2, but not by much. Overall I think the LD3 circuit design is also a little cleaner.

Even if you get a pair of 5654 driver tubes and 6H6PI to swap the stock LD2 tubes (5654 6AK5s and 6H6PI power tubes are stock on the LD3) it's going to set you back something like $50 for the 2 pairs. So then the LD3, cost-wise, is only $10 more.
Sound wise, with the same tubes they sound very similar. IMO the LD3 has a little less floor noise, but that could easily be because of the tubes, not the amp, and I have never listened to a LD2 and LD3 with the same tubes at the same time and A/Bd them in a reasonably objective way.

1092,"&gt;For any listening level above 65 dB or so, the bass boost is so severe that it interferes with pretty much everything

Interesting. If you are used to neutral sound, then yes, the Harman curve sounds off.  But to the average listener, a flat neutral sounding pair of speakers or headphones also sound equally off.

Also, I dont think you can extrapolate the popular appeal of the harman curve with headphones to speakers. I've EQd my speakers to the Harman curve too, and it's interesting that just like you I am put off by the bass at harman curve levels at higher volumes as well, but I'm not so put off at Harman-esque bass levels when I listen to the same music with headphones. 
 
I think it's because I subjectively perceive bass differently when I'm listening to speakers versus listening on headphones, and just comparing Hz and dB does not tell the whole story.

Having extensively heard the 60, 80 and 125, I'll be damned if I can tell a difference between them, sound wise.

There's not much difference build-wise too. In theory the 80e has matched drivers (that are ""destressed"", whatever that means) and the 125e.....well the 125 has ""UHPLC (Ultra-High Purity, Long Crystal) copper voice coil wire"". Except I translate ""UHPLC"" as ""Ultra-High Purity, Long *Con*"". And oh, the 125 diaphgrams are destressed too.

Having said this, to be fair I should also add that I do think that Grados deserve their iconic status - love 'em or hate 'em, nothing else sounds like them. They are great fun choices for the right kind of music.

&gt;As a student my original plan was to save up for a pair of HD600s but thinking I should save a lil money for other stuff.

If you are getting grados, get the SR60e. You'll save a lil money for other stuff, and your ears will never know.

1095,"&gt; i auditioned the valhallla 2 at a meet, and it didn't sound tubey at all

vally 2 is remarkably neutral for an OTL tube amp. If you are looking for what folks typically think of as 'tube sound"" you may be in for a surprise when you listen to the vally 2. 

Personally I like my tube amps to be warm and tubey, but if you desire a tube amp with a more neutral profile, IMO you should be looking at vally 2 or DIYing a torpedo

&gt; I've heard some people call the mk3 neutral. 

they are wrong

JVC is an interesting company, they make some great headphones that are essentially distributed only in Japan (like the HASZ2000 or the HPDX1000 or the HASW01/02). But for some reason JVC's audiophile marketing policy has been to pretty much ignore any part of the world that isn't Japan. They have gotten a little more penetration in the Asian market over the last few years, and have a modest presence in Europe (very modest, compared to their Japanese competitors like Sony or Fostex or AT)  and their high-end headphones are almost unknown in the US. It almost looks like JVC doesn't really give a damn about increasing high-end product sales :-)

they will last as long as your ear canals dont change their shape.  In general, the longer you wait between impressions and casting, the more likely that there will be small changes in dimensions that may require some fine tuning.

If you get your impressions done when you are in the UK and send them in a few weeks /months later, IMO you will be fine. Just make sure they dont get deformed on the ride from one continent to another - ear impression compound can shrink in very cold conditions, and even though in most large commercial planes the entire fuselage including the cargo hold is usually pressurized, sometimes the cargo holds in some smaller planes (especially those behind the aft bulkheads) may not be, and it can get frigidly cold at higher altitudes.

Having said that, I don't see you flying from Heathrow to HKIA in a Cessna, so the only thing I would probably be worried about is the risk of baggage handlers throwing your luggage around and the impression rattling inside, so make sure it is secure.",2016-06-12 15:53:41+00:00,d462ulb,1.0,t3_4nq0n9,12754.0,headphones

1132,"""Better"" is like my cousin - i.e. it's relative. 

TOTL CIEMs are probably the most subjective of all niches in this hobby. First, you can't really compare CIEMs in a truly objective way even though many CIEM manufacturers use the same drivers (for example, Knowles BA drivers) and the same kind of materials (acrylic or silicone) because each one of them is made with an n of 1 in mind. Second, every CIEM reflects the personality of its owner in a way that full size endgame headphone simply do not - you can learn more about someone from checking out their CIEM than their full size-headphones - unless you are [this guy](http://www.mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/buzz/2012/02/140029840.jpg), of course.

Third, CIEMs also suffer from the cult of personality in a way that full size headphones dont - Axell Grell does not have the same cult fan following as the John Moulton or Jerry Harvey.

Plus there's also soap-opera style drama in the CIEM world, that can significantly color how folks perceive certain brands. For example, the Wizard vs Heir or Jerry Harvey vs UE.

1202,"&gt;  I think /u/veni_vidi_vale has a dislike of the bravo stuff but I might be misremembering.

yes he does :-)

Mainly because Bravo amps are as bottom-of-the-barrel as it gets in this hobby, featuring a trifecta of crappiness - (1) crap components (there is low-end, which is fine, and then there is as-low-as-it-can-go-end, which is what Bravo uses, (2) crap design (I don't know why they even bother to call them ""tube amps"" because the tubes are pretty much used as decoration, since they don't really do any of the things you expect tubes to do in an amp) and (3) crap sounding (the v3 even has a 3-band EQ built into it, which might be convenient in theory, but all it manages to do is to introduce a frustrating amount of distortion into the sound signal).

Here's the problem with cheap tube amps in general - ""cheap"" and ""tube amp"" don't really go together in the same sentence. Why? Because high quality components for tube amps are expensive - well-made caps and pots aren't cheap, and good transformers can cost 100s of dollars, as can sought-after NOS tubes. Plus of course this is audiophilia, so the law of diminishing returns applies to everything you buy.

So in reality when you are looking for a cheap tube amp, it is really all about compromises.  Either you compromise on the components or the design. 

First off, IMO look at what the tube is doing in the tube amp. If it is just there to make the amp look pretty (hint: when you look at the circuit, are many of the pins just not connected?). If so, don't buy it - after all would you buy a car where the engine isn't connected to the driveshaft?

Second, is the tube actually being powered appropriately? Tubes need high voltages to work right (which is why you can get killed opening up a tube amp without knowing anything about it) and so if your ""tube amp"" is being powered by USB (hint: is the ""tube glow"" actually a LED?), then avoid it like you were pregnant and were being attacked by a swarm of Zika-carrying mosquitoes.

Third, if the tube is actually acting as the output buffer and not directly as the main amplifier, then the question to ask is: how is the amplification actually being done? (Hint: typically it is done by solid state components, such as MOSFETs). In that case, does the tube actually affect the sound? Pull the tube from the amp and fire it up. if you can still hear music just fine, the tube is just for show. Hybrid amps where the tube is used only to distort the sound in a pleasing fashion can be hit or miss - some amps actually do sound different when you swap tubes (such as the Aune T1), while others not so much.

And finally, is there such a thing as a decent cheap tube amp? Yes, I think so. Certainly not the Bravos and the Nobsounds of this world, though. I like the Little Dot Mk3 and the Crack and the Valhalla 2 because they are price performance champs - especially the Crack, but only if you can DIY, which requires a soldering iron and some level of familiarity with tubes (see *electrocution*, above). All these three are OTL tube amps, and if you want a tube amp with a transformer then IMO the cheapest decent transformer coupled tube amp you can get your hands on is the WA6.

Edit: added irresistible engine analogy :-)

1210,"Planar drivers aren't new. yamaha came out with the first planars in 1976 (they called them ""orthodynamic"" headphones), the Mario Bellini-designed HP1. For a while in the late 70s and early 80s planars were quite fashionable with the audiophile crowd, and you could find a reasonable selection of models. Later they fell out of favor because dynamic headphones become more popular (mainly because they were more suited to mass production).

I disagree with you that planar drivers are easier to design than dynamic drivers. *Good* drivers of both types are hard to deign, but intrinsically dynamic driver technology (the ""moving coil"") is easier to work with.

The reason Hifiman and Oppo have jumped onto the planar bandwagon IMO has more to do with profit margins than with R&amp;D or manufacturing concerns. Audeze was a trailblazer in the industry - they showed that you could position headphones as ""premium"" and charge an equally premium price for them, while keeping sales volumes small. Manufacturers like Hifiman clearly see a better ""oppo""rtunity for a higher ROI by positioning their products to the upscale crowd than to entry-level consumers. And its easier to please the upscale crowd with planars than dynamic driver headphones.

Companies like Sennheiser that make exclusively dynamic-driver headphones have done a *lot* of research on the technology, not only for headphones but also for microphones (which also use moving coil technology)

1238,"There's a fundamental problem with music streaming services today - their current business model is broken, because the increase in the number of plays  far outweighs the increase in the base number of subscribers.

Here's the existential dilemma for Spotify and its competitors: the more subscribers you get, the more you have to pay out as royalties. But you can't really adjust your subscription revenue on a sliding scale because customers are used to the monthly flat-fee model, and if you charge substantially higher subscription rates for the most active users, then those folks will just abandon the music service and go back to torrenting.

It's much more lucrative to ""sell"" a song online to a customer (like iTunes does) than to ""play"" the song online to a customer.

Sure, you can increase revenue by offering a ""premium"" service like Tidal has with lossless streams, but that's just kicking the can down the curb - this model works because there are relatively few subscribers and profit margins are currently greater than the standard, but as the number of premium subscribers grow, then the same imbalance will rear its head.

What's the solution? Streaming services need to [1] either have deep pockets to subsidize their operations, like Apple or Amazon, or [2] move to a sliding scale subscription model.

Because the RIAA sure aint going to change *their* tune anytime soon.

1254,"I agree with Arve. I too am pretty tired of seeing the same old arguments recycled again and again and again. The reason most folks don't see them is because we are pretty good about deleting the troll posts and the personal attacks, so that you don't have to ruin your day by reading the crap we do.

I just want to add 3 comments to Arve's post:

First, this sub skews differently than the other headphone forums online - for one, the population is *much* younger, which means they tend to have less disposable incomes than the stereotypical old-white-male audiophile crowd. And that influences the content of this sub *substantially*.

Which actually is the main reason I like this sub - its not pretentious, and it is audiophilia's best hope for the future - as a hobby we are a dying species, and unless young folks get into the hobby at the same (or greater) rate than folks who leave the hobby, or, well, die of old age, then the hobby will become extinct over time.

How much younger does the sub skew? Well, about half of ***everyone*** on reddit is between the ages of 18 and 24, and about 80% of everyone on reddit is between 18 and 35.  

That's a population advertisers and marketers are ready to die for, and so it becomes doubly important that the sub doesn't get inundated by commercial interests. And I think we mods do a good job of keeping it that way.

Second, all the mods on this sub are remarkably non-dictatorial. We don't delete stuff unless the rules are egregiously violated, we don't ban people just because we don't like what they say, and we try very hard not to interfere with conversations even if we don't agree with them. None of us have an agenda to highlight or an axe to grind, and none of us want to rule the world. We are all volunteers, and none of us have commercial conflicts of interest that would prevent us from being fair and balanced. I know of many other subs on reddit where the mods cannot say this (except /r/foxnews, of course).  

And third, I see folks on headfi and SBAF whining about the sub once in a while and how it would be *so much better* if it were more like &lt;insert forum name here&gt;. To those folks I say: this sub has its own identity, and if it just copies the memes and social conventions of another forum, then it just becomes an extension of that forum and cannot chart its own course on the internet. if you *really* don't like this place, then IMO rather than prolonging your agony, why not just leave and hang out in a forum that better meets your aspirations?

1280,"&gt;What happened?

There's a standard way to do AMAs on reddit now, given the number of fiascoes that have occured in the past. The person doing the AMA proves that they are who they say they are, and the AMA goes ahead as planned. 

There's a reason why all mods in all subs that allow AMAs now ask for proof - after all on the internet anyone can say that they are someone. I'm sure many of you have seen AMAs on other subs that end up as shitshows - that's why there are rules. Also, asking for proof prevents some social media/ publicity person from spamming reddit posing as celebrities, unless of course the person doing the AMA is OK with it.

To those who are saying why this particular instance could not be treated differently than others: the rules apply equally to *everyone*, whether they are small business owners or the CEOs of major headphone corporations. Even Bill Gates has to show proof every time before being allowed to do an AMA!

1299,"Every time someone asks me if burn in is real i respond ""Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no spoon. Then you will see it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.""

Burn in is controversial because there's no really good proof that the phenomenon is real. I get the theory for large drivers in speakers - that mechanical movement causes wear and the actual pattern of movement of components changes over time as they fall into spec - but headphones have tiny moving parts, and it is hard to believe that the sonic changes after a few hours of use are clearly audible and measurable like they are in, say giant woofers.

Personally, I think that it's more that the listener's *brain* burns in to the new sound rather than the headphones.

But having said that, I still burn in my new audio gear. Why? because it's a ritual.

What's a ritual, you ask? You know, the dude who comes out onto the base ball pitch, smacks his left shin three times with his bat, spits to his right, grabs his crotch twice, twirls the baseball bat six times and faces East and says ""lucky rabbit"" three times because he thinks that's gonna make him hit a home run? That's a ritual.

But just like baseball players, I'm superstitious and burn in my headphones, even though it may be a complete waste of time. I have a pink noise file on an mp3 player that I play at just higher than normal volume for 30-50 hours, and then a whole bunch of my favorite Gary Numan albums (The Pleasure Principle, I Assassin, Replicas, Exile, Dream Corrosion, White Noise, Pure).

But remember, if you use the entire Gary Numan discography to burn in your headphones like I do, leave them in your automobile overnight, because here in my car, I can only receive, I can listen to you, it keeps me stable for days, in cars.",2016-05-12 15:05:43+00:00,d32qrip,1.0,t3_4izt9p,21607.0,headphones

1315,"This hobby will always remain divided between subjectivists and objectivists, and that's the way it has been since the dawn of time.

To be fair, both sides have their valid arguments. Subjectivists sometimes truly engage in magical thinking, and the demand for rational scientific validity by objectivists is perfectly rational.

But there's also a lot of half-baked pseudoscience bandied about as scientific proof by objectivists, and a lot of defensive posturing by subjectivists trying to show evidence of stuff that simply cannot be proven.

There's a reason why you don't see the kind of truly scientific studies you see in, say medicine for excample - they are expensive, and noone in audiophileland can get that kind of funding unless they work for industry. The traditional biology and healthcare funders (like the NIH) are not going to fund an R01 looking at psychoacoustic phenomenon, that's for sure.

  There is also a very narrow zone of journals where you can get this kind of science published (Proceedings of AES is probably the most well known venue to publish audiophilia results, and when you look at the big picture of scientific research its impact factor is so small it can be measured in Angstroms.) 

At its core, audiophilia is a subjective hobby, and there are many more subjective audiophiles (spending a lot more money) than objectivists out there, so this equation isn't really going to change anytime soon.

/u/ttdpaco says that it's mostly objectivists who are toxic and bullying. I get to see all kinds of posts on the sub, including the ones that are deleted by me and the other mods, and I will say this:  there are trolls of every persuasion who post on the sub, and when it comes to objectivists and subjectivists there are smart people and audio fundamentalists in both camps.

Op makes some very valid points in his post. But it;s worth keeping in mind that at its core, audiophilia is a subjective hobby, and there are many more subjective audiophiles (spending a lot more money) than objectivists out there, and this equation isn't really going to change anytime soon. I'm not trying to defend subjectivity, just telling it like it is. $100 headphones are not where the industry is at, speaking from a business perspective. Go to any hifi store and see who buys the stuff - it's mostly older folks with large disposable incomes and a very subjective approach to the hobby.

Personally, I think its a good thing that we allow both objectivists and subjectivists to have their say on the sub, because Yin would be awfully lonely without Yang.",2016-04-29 19:40:01+00:00,d2mh3nt,1.0,t3_4gzose,17856.0,headphones

1352,"From the last time, updated

Its not the $95 it was last November

When that deal rolled around, I put together a FAQ of questions

****

Q: This versus the regular 598?

A: With this, you also get a 3.5mm terminated cable.



****

Q: Should I buy these or the momentum 2?

A: if you want to use them on the go, then momentums are a better idea. If for gaming, 598s

****

Q Should I get the SHP9500 or the 598s?

A: the 598s

A2: /u/LordDango  says ""You like laid back sound? 598 You like a little more forward and energetic sound? 9500""

****

Q: Ordered. I have now entered the headphone game. Any other stuff I need to complete my experience audiophiles?

A: No. Plug the 598s into whatever source you have now and then decide later if you want an external dac/amp or not. The 598 does benefit modestly with an amp.

****

Q:Ugh I am so tempted by this but I already have an HD600 and just got a Fidelio X2 for giggles this week. I'd be crazy to buy this, right?

A: yup, unless you collect headphones or you want to mod the 598

****

Q: I have spare money, I have the HD650s and ATH-M50s. Should I buy these?

A: Not really. The 650 should keep you plenty satisfied.

****

Q: What's a good Dac for this?

A: It really depends on your budget. Veni's rule of thumb: don'tr spend more on your dac or amp than  you do on your headphones. And that means $95 if you get the 598s today. Unless, of course, you plan to upgrade your headphones soon and want to futureproof your gear.

****

Q: Hmmm, rocking a pair of DT770 80's. Wondering if I should jump on these so I have a pair of good sounding open backs. 

A: IMO the 598s make a nice complementary conmtrast to the 770s without breaking the bank. Especially today.

****

Q: Just recently picked up a pair of HD 558, this enough of an upgrade to bother?

A: No

****

Q: Cheapest acceptable amp I can get for these?

A: Monoprice desktop amp, Fiio E10K, Magni, O2. You know you really don't *need* an amp for these, don't you?

****

Q: You've never failed me before. Would this 598 deal be a good upgrade from the 518s?

A: The differences are more subtle than night-and-day. The 518 is a little bassier, although the bass is somewhat looser. 598 mids are a little richer, to me the 518 mids dip enough at 1000-3000 Hz for me to call it ""V"" shaped. A shallow V, but V nonetheless :-)
And if you hear percussive high end like hi-hats or tympani, the 518 sounds (at least to me) a little more recessed than the 598.
Also, IMO the 598 is a hair more comfortable for extended sessions than the 518, although that is probably my imagination.
So in sum, if you go into this expecting only modest differences, you will probably appreciate the nuanced improvement of the 598, but if you are expecting night and day, it's not going to work out for you.

****

Q: Will these be a big improvement over the ATH-AD700?

A: If you want a more colored sound, then yes. TBH if you are a huge fan of AD700 sound, you're probably not going to be happy with ther dark profile of the 598

****

Q: I currently have SOL Republic Headphones. 
Am I going to be blown away by the quality of the HD 598's? 

A: ""Blown away"" really depends on the amount of expolosives you use. But I can confidently say, yes you will hear an audible difference.

****

Q: I ordered the AKG K7xx from Massdrop. Should I get this instead and cancel the K7xx order?

A: This is a tricky one. Overall the K7xx is probably a superior pair of headphones from a purely SQ perspective. But the 598 is IMO more euphonic. It really boils down to a question of individual preference. 



****

Q: How much sound 'leak' would these produce? As the main environment I'd be buying them for would be a quiet office.

A: they do leak some. At normal listening levels someone in the next cubicle would barely be able to make any details out, but if you crank up the volume in a quiet office, sound will carry.

****

Q: I'm split between these and a pair of Bose soundtrue over-ear

A: Don't get the Bose. Instead get the 598. I have heard both, and please, trust me on this.

****

Q: What is the difference between these and the regular 598?

A: color

****

Q: I will mostly use them to play CS GO, which direction sounds are very important, will I need to get an amp?

A: positional cues and direction depend on soundstage, whbich does not really change much with an amp

****

Q: hmmm would you guys hold out for HD600 to go on sale or just get this one?

A: If you know that the 600 will be on sale, then I would hold out for it. If you are just guess that the 600 will be on sale, well then a bird in the hand is worth a 600 in the bush

****

Q: Regardless of the price difference, does anyone have any thoughts on the 598 vs the AD900x?...I have a pair of grado sr80e's

A: If you like grado sound, you are probably going to prefer the 900x to the 598

****

Q: How might these be for gaming?

A: They are great for gaming.

****

Q: So my only pair of headphones are Fostex TH-600's. Would the 598's be a good complement to these?

A: I would probably go with the HD650, TBH. But this is an acceptable budget compromise

****

Q:I also want to get a turntable soon, should I do that first or expand my headphone collection? 

A: Get the vinyl. Neil (Pono) Young will love you for it.

****

Q: Are these an upgrade from my Fidelio L1s?

A: IMO yes

****

Q: Anyone on how these compare to my Grado SR 80?

A: They have a ***very*** different sound profile. I could go on and on, but to save time I will just say that the highs are significantly recessed compared to the SR80.

****

Q: Are these good for portable use?

A: No


****

Q: Was going to save and buy the hd 650s, is this a good enough deal that I should buy these?

A: IMO continue to save for the 650s

The master disk is cut from acetate, and then the acetate etching is electroplated with metal (usually silver and nickel). This metal ""plate"" is eased from the acetate and is called the ""father"".

Records are stamped from the father plate, and the mother plate is placed in reserve in case more stampers need to be created.

And the line out (in case you want to use the 2i2 for line out output) compises of a pair of ***TS*** jacks and not RCA out, so you need to buy TS to RCA adapters to actually use them in the context of a listening station setup.

1460,"I remember the days before we implemented the purchase sticky - the sub was a mess to wade through, with a million questions asking for purchase advice for sub-$100 headphones or gaming headsets that hid most decent content. I'd scroll through a couple of pages and give up.

Things have improved a lot since then, and when reddit let us have a second sticky, it became possible to rotate interesting discussions in addition to the purchase advice thread.

The problem is that not every question in the purchase sticky is answerable. If you follow the format, are patient, and understand that conversations on the internet don't have the same kind of instant gratification and responses you get in RL F2F conversations, your likelihood of getting an answer is good. 

Also, not all questions have a clear answer, and not everyone answering questions in the sticky is familiar with *every* headphone out there. Also, folks who regularly answer the same questions again and again in the sticky often burn out and have to walk away for a while (I know I do).

Regarding OPs specific points:

&gt; 1. The current state of the Daily Purchase Advice thread lacks advice.

This sub offers more useful purchase advice (in both quantity and quality) than any other internet forum bar headfi. And on headfi you are more likely to get elitist answers than on /r/headphones (not that there is anything wrong with that)

&gt; 2. The Recommended Headphones Guide and the Head-Fi Buying Guide doesn't actually give any guidance or advice to new buyers.

I think I disagree with this premise, because IMO the guide is plenty useful to folks who are clueless. But I hear what OP is saying - I have been asked on multiple occasions to write a headphone guide, and my answer has always been ""no"", because I don't have the time. The problem with maintaining a headphones guide is that it is *very* time consuming and you have to constantly update it because prices and models change. The folks maintaining it are volunteers and often don't have time to keep up, because they have jobs and other things to do IRL. 

If you want to see something better, create it! /r/headphones has a wiki, so you can always put your money where your mouth is, so to speak.

&gt; 3. Headphones are an investment (?).

This is true, but different folks have different levels of discretionary income they can throw on their headphones, and what is over someone's limit is loose change for another. That;'s why it is so important IMO to specify budget when asking for purchase advice otherwise the answer to every question is ""HD800"".

And finally, a special request to /u/tawl: you say ""he last time I tried to ask a simple question and challenge the mods about the current rules I was met with surprisingly personal threats and borderline admin abuse so I doubt things will change""

this isn't a fascist state, and mods aren't in cahoots with each other to create an evil headphones empire. If you have proof, post it or PM me with it and I will examine at your accusations with a fair eye. But if you are just stirring up trouble for no reason, then please don't.

1516,"very cool ad for Grado. Especially the visual of the two of them ""suiting up"" in their comfy chairs :-)

Grado is making a concerted effort to shed their image as holdovers from the 60s making antiquated headphones that sound very un-reference (is that a word?) out of a graffiti- encrusted sweatshop in ~~a third world country~~ Brooklyn. And don't tell me how charming the neighborhood is, I've been there and there's nothing charming about 7th Avenue.

Good to see the new generation of Grado taking the company in a new direction. IMO thats what American small business is all about.

To balance the equation, a couple of constructive thoughts:

&gt;  This is consistent with a long-term hearing preservation benefit.

First, IMO *this* is probably what you should be highlighting as the cornerstone of your marketing strategy (apart from trying to capitalize on current VR hype), but only if you have data to back up your statement.  Coupled with some objective graphs of the frequency response of real prototypes (rather than just general characterizations), because while subjective opinions by individuals are important, many dont have the credibility that objective data can bring to the table - for example [this review](http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20160320/taction-technology-reveals-bassrich-haptic-headphone/) isnt a review, it is an ad by someone who has clearly never listened to your product.

&gt;S. James Biggs, Ph.D., CTO of Taction Technology

Second, I have backed a bunch of kickstarters before and typically do my due diligence research on the folks behind the project before supporting them. When I see that the folks behind a project are less than well qualified, I tend to run like hell, which is why I didn't back the [dude making potato salad](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad/description) even though many folks did. 

In the past, tactile technology has typically been used as a gimmick in the personal audio industry. But to be fair, IMO you are more qualified than the creators of many of the projects I have previously backed, and your qualifications and links to some of the papers you have published should probably be at the top of the kickstarter page! After all, if you were trying to secure funding from conventional avenues than kickstarter, isn't that what you would be leading with?

Good luck with the project!

You dont have to just focus on the amps for it to be an infomercial.

Since this is an audiophile sub, let me tell you my story the audiophile way:

****

[On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puHoadtIivc)

Warm smell of expensive audio gear, rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

I had to stop for the night

There he stood in the doorway;

I heard the hi-fi salesman say ""we have those headphones you wanted to listen to""

And I was thinking to myself,

""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""

Then he lit up a tube amp and he showed me the way

There were voices down the corridor,

I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to TOTL audio nirvana

Such a lovely pair (Such a lovely pair)

Such a lovely zebrano wood face

Plenty of headroom at TOTL audio nirvana

Any time of year (Any time of year)

You can find it here

So I called the hi-fi salesman and said:

""Please bring me my 'phones""

He said, ""We haven't had that kind of headphone here since nineteen sixty nine""

And still those voices are calling from far away,

Wake you up in the middle of the night

Just to hear them say...


Welcome to TOTL audio nirvana

Such a lovely pair (Such a lovely pair)

Such a lovely leather pad

They livin' it up at TOTL audio nirvana

What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)

Bring your flac files

Mirrors on the ceiling

We drink pink champagne on ice

And he said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""

And in the master's chambers,

They gathered for the audition

They stab it with their steely knives,

But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was

Running for the door

I had to find the passage back

To the place I was before

""Relax, "" said the hi fi salesman,

""We are programmed to receive.

You can check out the Ultrasone Edition 10 any time you like,


But you can never leeeeeeeeaave! ""

1577,"Its not the $95 it was last November, but it is the first decent drop in price since then, and $20 cheaper than the current price of the regular $598.

When that deal rolled around, I put together a FAQ of questions, which is just as valid at $130 as it was at $95:

****

****

Q: Should I buy these or the momentum 2?

A: if you want to use them on the go, then momentums are a better idea. If for gaming, 598s

****

Q Should I get the SHP9500 or the 598s?

A: the 598s

****

Q: Ordered. I have now entered the headphone game. Any other stuff I need to complete my experience audiophiles?

A: No. Plug the 598s into whatever source you have now and then decide later if you want an external dac/amp or not. The 598 does benefit modestly with an amp.

****

Q:Ugh I am so tempted by this but I already have an HD600 and just got a Fidelio X2 for giggles this week. I'd be crazy to buy this, right?

A: yup, unless you collect headphones or you want to mod the 598

****

Q: I have spare money, I have the HD650s and ATH-M50s. Should I buy these?

A: Not really. The 650 should keep you plenty satisfied.

****

Q: What's a good Dac for this?

A: It really depends on your budget. Veni's rule of thumb: don'tr spend more on your dac or amp than  you do on your headphones. And that means $95 if you get the 598s today. Unless, of course, you plan to upgrade your headphones soon and want to futureproof your gear.

****

Q: Hmmm, rocking a pair of DT770 80's. Wondering if I should jump on these so I have a pair of good sounding open backs. 

A: IMO the 598s make a nice complementary conmtrast to the 770s without breaking the bank. Especially today.

****

Q: Just recently picked up a pair of HD 558, this enough of an upgrade to bother?

A: No

****

Q: Cheapest acceptable amp I can get for these?

A: Monoprice desktop amp, Fiio E10K, Magni, O2. You know you really don't *need* an amp for these, don't you?

****

Q: You've never failed me before. Would this 598 deal be a good upgrade from the 518s?

A: The differences are more subtle than night-and-day. The 518 is a little bassier, although the bass is somewhat looser. 598 mids are a little richer, to me the 518 mids dip enough at 1000-3000 Hz for me to call it ""V"" shaped. A shallow V, but V nonetheless :-)
And if you hear percussive high end like hi-hats or tympani, the 518 sounds (at least to me) a little more recessed than the 598.
Also, IMO the 598 is a hair more comfortable for extended sessions than the 518, although that is probably my imagination.
So in sum, if you go into this expecting only modest differences, you will probably appreciate the nuanced improvement of the 598, but if you are expecting night and day, it's not going to work out for you.

****

Q: Will these be a big improvement over the ATH-AD700?

A: If you want a more colored sound, then yes. TBH if you are a huge fan of AD700 sound, you're probably not going to be happy with ther dark profile of the 598

****

Q: I currently have SOL Republic Headphones. 
Am I going to be blown away by the quality of the HD 598's? 

A: ""Blown away"" really depends on the amount of expolosives you use. But I can confidently say, yes you will hear an audible difference.

****

Q: I ordered the AKG K7xx from Massdrop. Should I get this instead and cancel the K7xx order?

A: This is a tricky one. Overall the K7xx is probably a superior pair of headphones from a purely SQ perspective. But the 598 is IMO more euphonic. It really boils down to a question of individual preference. 



****

Q: How much sound 'leak' would these produce? As the main environment I'd be buying them for would be a quiet office.

A: they do leak some. At normal listening levels someone in the next cubicle would barely be able to make any details out, but if you crank up the volume in a quiet office, sound will carry.

****

Q: I'm split between these and a pair of Bose soundtrue over-ear

A: Don't get the Bose. Instead get the 598. I have heard both, and please, trust me on this.

****

Q: What is the difference between these and the regular 598?

A: color

****

Q: I will mostly use them to play CS GO, which direction sounds are very important, will I need to get an amp?

A: positional cues and direction depend on soundstage, whbich does not really change much with an amp

****

Q: hmmm would you guys hold out for HD600 to go on sale or just get this one?

A: If you know that the 600 will be on sale, then I would hold out for it. If you are just guess that the 600 will be on sale, well then a bird in the hand is worth a 600 in the bush

****

Q: Regardless of the price difference, does anyone have any thoughts on the 598 vs the AD900x?...I have a pair of grado sr80e's

A: If you like grado sound, you are probably going to prefer the 900x to the 598

****

Q: How might these be for gaming?

A: They are great for gaming.

****

Q: So my only pair of headphones are Fostex TH-600's. Would the 598's be a good complement to these?

A: I would probably go with the HD650, TBH. But this is an acceptable budget compromise

****

Q:I also want to get a turntable soon, should I do that first or expand my headphone collection? 

A: Get the vinyl. Neil (Pono) Young will love you for it.

****

Q: Are these an upgrade from my Fidelio L1s?

A: IMO yes

****

Q: Anyone on how these compare to my Grado SR 80?

A: They have a ***very*** different sound profile. I could go on and on, but to save time I will just say that the highs are significantly recessed compared to the SR80.

****

Q: Are these good for portable use?

A: No


****

Q: Was going to save and buy the hd 650s, is this a good enough deal that I should buy these?

A: IMO continue to save for the 650s

IMO you are best served by an IEM that passively attenuates noise rather than one with active noise canceling (ANC) because the constant frequency change and start-and-stop of dental drills will result in poor ANC attenuation.

The trick is to find the right tips to your IEM that seal well - you should get the same amount of noise attenuation as decent earplugs (20-30 dB) and if you do listen to music you wont have to crank up the volume and damage your hearing.

1591,"Yes the 846 is big, as IEMs go. Especially compared to its primary competitor, the Senn IE800, which IMO is more comfortable to wear for extended sessions. And yes it is expensive. But it is also one of the most innovative IEM designs out there, and not just because of the BA driver cluster or the filters or the tantalizingly gorgeous clear shell or even the [cool little tool they give you to unscrew the stem](http://ext.fullcompass.com/images/183399.jpg). 

The real reason I love the 846 is [this](http://www.shure.co.uk/dms/shure/products/earphones/images/se846/se846-inner-driver_10_cols/se846-inner-driver_10_cols.jpg) See the stack of plates that look like the insides of an auto transmission in front of the quad-driver array? There are ten little plates that add an extra 4 inches to the sound path, and a critical 4 inches it is too because it acts as a 75Hz low pass filter. And thats what gives the 846 its simply awesome bass. I love the IE800 too, but IE800 bass simply cannot compare to what the 856 puts out.

While you are drooling over the picture of the 846 internals, the little step at the bottom is where the 3-way crossover circuit lives. Now-a-days, when it seems like *every* IEM manufacturer has gotten into the BA armature race (""more is better!"") folks forget that not every IEM manufacturer does crossovers right. Shure does crossover very well indeed, and the 2 low+1 mid+1 high driver combo of the 846 does exactly what you think a multi BA configuration should do.

And if you yearn for a CIEM but dont want to risk getting one because of the poor resale value compared to universals, you can get a Sensaphonics sleeve for the 846 and enjoy the best of both worlds. Although it is worth noting that the Sensaphonics sleeve for the 215 also fits the 315, 425 and 535, but the 846 sleeve doesnt fit any other Shure model.

&gt;I've read that the SZ1000 sounds better for all around listening

The main reason I bought the SZ2K was because of its innovative design. It has three unique features, IMO. 

First, the Kelton speaker design for the bass driver is super cool, and the way the JVC engineers built the [dual bass reflex chamber](http://cdn.jvc.eu/szfxz/sz/img/more/db_ref.gif) is IMO  diabolically clever. And lets not forget those ducts that ""filter"" the bass. Fiendishly innovative, for headphones.

Second, carbon nanotubes. Need I say more?

And third, the JVC engineers got around the whole low-frequency vibration issue (undesirable!) by enclosing the diaphgram assembly in a [thick brass cylinder](http://cdn.jvc.eu/szfxz/sz/img/features_04.png) which acts as a rigid dampener.

Except then they castrated the SZ2K to produce the SZ1K - the 1K has a plastic dampening cylinder, smaller ducts, and the 30mm driver takes over later in the FR so there's a perceptible dip and notch in the 300-1000 Hz range (is that what folks think makes it sound better? Because it doesn't).

Here in the US, I'm paying a premium for both the 1K and the 2K because JVC isn't really interested in marketing them stateside. I got the SZ2K because I figured, heck I might as well get me the model with the feature what attracted me to the SZ series in the first place - the brass cylinder.

And no, the link won't take you to an infomercial by Jude.

It does have some pros, to be fair. Build quality is impeccable. It decodes pretty much whatever you throw at it. There are a plethora of input choices, from SPDIF to A2DP aptX. The rated battery life of 10 hours pretty much mirrors real world use (which is surprising for battery specs, since manufacturers typically tend to inflate how long a charge lasts). The digital volume control is precise. The crossfeed filter works. The LED color changes are hypnotic.

The coolest thing about the Hugo, though, is the FPGA DAC. Rather than use a delta sigma over-the-counter DAC chip, Rob Watts built his own processing platform. If you are interested in this, download his presentation from [here](http://chordelectronics.co.uk/files/Hugo-DAC-Technical-Master-Class.pptx) and be prepared to ooh and aah.

And for those who are interested in internal pics, [here is one](https://audiograb.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/cicuit_face_1-2.jpg) that will also probably make you ooh and aah.

But it has some cons too. It's not really a transparent dac/amp - like many others, I too found it to veer a tad on the bright side. Not as bright as, say a Burson, but not as transparent as an O2 either. Which is saying something.

Plus I found the UI to be unappealing, with tiny fiddly switches, crowded connector jacks and a plethora of VIBGYOR color coded status indicators that require you to carry around notes to remember what is what (so blue is 192kHz, reddish purple is 352.8, and deep purple is 384? Or is it the other way around?). And in a society where red means ""stop"" and yellow means ""wait"" and green means ""go"", in the Hugo minimum crossfeed is red, moderate crossfeed is green and max crossfeed is *blue*?  Hard to remember all these variants.

Here's what killed the Hugo for me: it's clearly intended to be a portable unit, but its a little too big to be truly in-my-pocket portable. There are plenty of more compact, high-end mobile audiophile solutions (for example, A&amp;K). Plus I don't really need all that connectivity on the go (how many times have you used RCA coax in when you were commuting on the bus to work?) 

So from a portable perspective, the Hugo becomes just a very expensive toy that you really don't want to take on the road because if you lose it you will be so depressed you will cry a river to tears. And for the same price as a Hugo I can choose between a multitude of endgame desktop amp/dac setups.

So why pay the premium for the Hugo? Well not for the ""aircraft grade aluminum"" it is milled from, even though you could argue that it is indeed a work of art. IMO what you are really paying for is Rob Watts ingenuity in devising the FPGA setup. To me that is the unique feature of the Hugo, not the gimmicky party light LEDs or the claim of audiophile transportability.",2016-03-29 16:55:01+00:00,d1hvf75,1.0,t3_4c9efa,115858.0,headphones

Ive never compared Tung Sol KT120s to JJ KT88s. The JJs aren't NOS, they are reissues - JJ bought the old Tesla factory in Slovakia and has been putting out tubes only since (if memory serves me right) the mid 90s.

The hype for the Sylvania 6SJ7s seems to be mostly for the black plate versions. WGT = military spec, so they should last longer (some were also labeled JAN, which means they were made for a Joint Army Navy requisition).  Sometimes you will see a ""VT229"" stamped on the mil spec 6SJ7s, which typically will have an extra support rod (I'm guessing for high-vibration environments).

I love the look of the original X00 wood. Will be interesting to se how this looks IRL.

From the MD X00 page:

&gt;The sub-bass through bass is increased ~2 dB, while following the same curve as the original, which peaks at 50 Hz. The lower midrange is decreased by ~5 dB, and while the mahogany version had a slight peak at ~600 Hz, the purpleheart has a smoother climb from 500 to 1000 Hz. The midrange proper is essentially identical to that of the mahogany, the upper midrange is ~2 dB less throughout, and the highs are slightly more emphasized.

my translation: more like the TH600, but with better sub bass

Edit: From Will

&gt;Well good news folks. Because this is the first time a situation like this has come up (where we’re releasing an alternative version of the product while customers are still waiting on the original to ship) we’re giving all participants of the last TH-X00 drop the opportunity to switch to the Purpleheart if they so desire.
If you want to get in on the purpleheart, join the drop and email support@massdrop.com asking to have your previous order canceled.

Edit 2: bolded drop start time. At least folks wont have to line up at midnight like jackasses this time (like folks did for the first THX00 drop, and I must disclose that to my shame I was one of them. Low serial number FT....W?)

If you are going to do it right, you will need a decent head mannequin, a test chamber that is adequately isolated, and a tester that can measure precisely (Tyll uses Audio precision gear, if memory serves me right).  Then you also need to devise a way to accommodate for HTRF (Head Related Transfer Function).

The easy way to do it is to buy a cheap but reasonably accurate dB meter (like the one I linked to) and hold it approximately where your ear would be with respect to the driver.

Do you know how much power the origen puts out at different impedances - x mW at 32 ohms, y mW at 250 ohms, z mW at 600 ohms, etc. I looked for this information but could not find it anywhere online.

Also, any chance your tech team would consider changing the potentiometer to something a little more reliable? Even a cheap ALPS unit wouldnt increase the cost of the Origen too much and would make it much more attractive!

this is true. Compared to most portable amp dacs that have fiddly little knobs designed for pediatric audiophiles, the origen does have a decent sized knob.

1789,"If I had to describe the origen in one word, it would have to be ""average"".

D/A is done by a Cirrus Logic CS4392 chip = meh, but  to be fair, it does natively process DSD, which is a good thing as long as you have DSD files to play.

The opamp is a JRC NJM4556  = same as the one in the Cmoy spec - nwavguy once called it ""the 50 cent part"" in one of his blogs. I'm not implying that the 4556 is a bad chip, but if you were expecting the Origen to contain components that were anything above low-end, you were expecting too much.

The USB chip is the VIA VT1736 = crappy drivers, but it'll work with your device, most likely. It's not an XMOS, thats for sure. At one time, VIA used to make CPUs. Its sad to see how low they have fallen since their heydey when they bought out companies like Centaur and Cyrix.

Now I must mention the pot = IMO this is the achilles heel of the origen - it is truly bottom of the barrel. Channel imbalance isn't just audible, it is palpable, at least in the unit that I was foolish enough to buy.

The origen's power output is anemic, its hard to find specific numbers (I wonder why!), but it's USB powered, you know it's not going to be able to power super high impedance headphones or current-greedy headphones (like most planars) with authority. But forget about 600 ohm beyers, it struggles to power my HD650s. And my T50RPs sound tinny and weak.

And finally, sound quality. It's meh. Details are somewhat lost at the upper end, and it veers slightly warm of neutral. Sound profile is similar to an E10, but with a little more treble smearing.

But it does have some positive elements. The output is 5.6VRMS, so it may be a better choice than, say the Fulla. It has both 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch jacks, which is more convenient than having to fiddle with the adapter. Output impedance isn't terribly high (if memory serves me right, it is 0.5 ohms, I'm sure someone will correct me if I didn't remember right). 

And its heavy for its size. Not heavy enough to be used as a weapon, but heavy enough to be used as a paperweight :-)

tl;dr: For $100, its a reasonable entry level dac/amp. But I'd probably just pass on it - you might as well use your phone / computer a little longer, save up another hundred bucks, and get a schiit stack or something equivalent that will be harder better faster stronger. Because despite the DSD capability, IMO the Origen isn't really futureproof. You'll try to upgrade as soon as you unbox it.

edit: I got a PM that asked if I knew Zeos loved the Origen , and that I should watch his review because I would probably change my opinion about the origen afterwards. Yes I know Zeos loved it in his review with a passion he normally reserves for sous-vide cooking and showtunes (not to mention underage anime wallpapers).  I think I'll stand by what I wrote in this post.

good and bad

good reviewers can be either subjective or objective or both

good objective reviewers: know their theory, know how to objectively compare headphones, generate good data, display it well, understand the limitations of quantitative science, don't resort to invoking the tired old cliches of ""double blind"" and ""randomized"" every  time they open their mouths. 

good subjective reviewers: have great narrative skills (""story tellers""), know how to use qualitative techniques, offer honest subjective opinions without shilling, understand the limitations of subjectivity, don't resort to bashing objectivists at every step or engaging in snake oil-worship or magical thinking.

And bad reviewers? These are mostly amateur wannabes who are more interested in getting their hands on freebies or scoring brownie points with manufacturers than providing any real value. Or they are misinformed, ignorant and confabulate excessively.

There was a time when the M50s were price-performance kings. If you were a basshead and wanted a cheap closed isolating portable pair of headphones, the M50 was your best bet because it was often on sale under $100 (I remember buying a couple for $85 each to gift to folks a few Christmases ago).

But then 2 things happened: AT made the M50x (the successor model to the M50) more ""upscale"" and other companies put out a bunch of models priced around $100-150 that had equivalent or better SQ. Suddenly for $150 the M50x didn't look so hot anymore.

But some folks on personal audio forums still went on recommending the M50x to *everyone* who wanted a pair of entry-level headphones, even though it was increasingly obvious there were other options that made more sense from a price-performance perspective. And so the M50x was subjected to increasing flak until it became somewhat fashionable to beat up on it.

I still recommend the M50x once in a while,. But rarely, for select situations. And definitely as often as I used to recommend the original M50 a few years ago.

re. 770s for gaming, typically open headphones have larger soundstages than closed headphones. The 770 is closed. if you are willing to live with that, then yes

1844,"the short answer is: you cant, at least not if you try to replace just the bass driver unit.

The SZ2000 uses a Kelton design (look it up!) - one end of the speaker unit is sealed, with an air chamber leading to a resonance duct. The driver is *behind* the seal of the speaker unit, so you can't directly get to it easily without wrecking the enclosure.

If you can get your hands on a replacemen double-bass-reflex speaker unit (the entire enclosure andc not just the driver) then yes you might be able to swap it, but you are going to run  into two more issues: there are 2 ""ducts"" inside the driver enclosure (one to each of the bass reflex chambers) that you will have to replace.

It would be a lot easier if your tweeter driver(the 30mm driver)  was broken

no thats just not true. While good software EQ may have *the same effect* as hardware EQ, they are not identical.

Also, how you EQ is different - for example, you need to watch out for clipping much more closely with software EQ than for hardware EQ.",2016-03-17 03:11:53+00:00,d12uiwi,2.0,t1_d12nq8s,11343.0,headphones

Instead, acknowledge them by lifting up an arm and wiggling your fingers.  Then ignore them. If they talk to you, pretend you can't hear them because of, well, the headphones. You can circle forefinger and thumb into an ""OK"" gesture  if you think they are telling you something particularly important.

thats par for the EF2A. IMO rolling tubes isnt going to help the noise floor. I would suggest Mullard M8100s (6AK5s) if you are looking for a decent pair of NOS tubes. Keep in mind that the EF2A is a hybrid, so while you will see *some* changes in the sound by swapping tubes, it wont be night-and-day.

But TBH, I should also add that I am not a fan of the EF2A. It has absurdly high floor noise and even more absurdly preset gain so that the sound gets either painful or nauseating with even minimal excursions of the pot. Plus pot imbalance is often a significant issue (because you have to keep the pot at a lower level and that's where imbalance is most in cheap pots)

1850,"&gt; At what price point do you find the best value?

""Best value"" is a sliding scale. It depends on how much $ you have and what your price-performance tipping point is.

The only real value is one that lies below what you can *really* afford (which means you spend only your discretionary income on headphones)

For example, a HD650 for $499 (its MSRP) isnt a good value. I bought my HD650 many years ago for $400 and thought it was  great value. But then 650 prices dropped like a rock, and for a while in 2015 $300-350 was the price point when the HD650 was great value. 

Moral: value varies over time

The SHP9500 is $75 on Amazon right now. Thats no value. At $60, Zeos thinks it's the best value. I don't, because IMO if you put lipstick on a pig it still says ""oink"" when you squeeze it. And by ""pig"" I mean the SHP9500, not Zeos :-)

Moral: value is different depending on who is doing the defining

The SR80e is $100. Many Gradophiles will tell you it's the best value in Grados. But if you hear the SR60 and the SR80, they sound exactly the same. So is the SR60e a better value at $80? Purely from a price-performance perspective, yes.  But if you don't like Grado sound, you won't agree.

Moral: value depends on the subjective preference of the person who is making the pronouncement

If I had to choose an arbitrary ballpark figure (which, reading your post, is apparently what you want), then i would say that you should be able to get a decent pair of headphones under $400 and be able to live with your decision using the justification that it's good ""value"". Above that magical $400 figure, the improvements become less noteworthy and the premium pricing model becomes steeper.

tl;dr: value = Different ~~strikes~~ strokes for different folks. Just dont pay MSRP for headphones.

not necessarily. It could also muddy the sound considerably. Depends more on design, drivers and seal than on just the rings.

If you look at the graphs Dunu put out for their DN2000J and read the reviews, it also seems to increase flex and increased sub-bass, my guess if that the ring is also covering up a vent in the shell (increasing pressure inside the ear)

PS You would think its better in business class but it isn't. Let me tell you a story: I once got to sit next to a person with open headphones (some junk brand from Walmart) who listened to the same couple of songs *over and over and over* again at an insanely high level throughout the 8 or 9 hour flight, and I will tell you this: even though he was a little distance away from me, I could make out every word and *nothing* can be as bad as having to listen to Brad Paisley telling me (and everyone else in the cabin) repeatedly that she's sunday drive meets high-speed chase and she ain't just a song, she's the whole mixtape  and she's so complicated because that's the way God made her. I have that song etched forever in my mind because of the jackass with the open headphones. Pity me, for I now have to carry this sad burden with me all my life.

First, audiophilia is a niche retail area. Niche markets behave somewhat differently than markets for commodities that have huge product volumes.

Also, calculating markup can be quite scientific. In addition to supply and demand criteria, you can determine optimum product pricing using some sophisticated math. Demand is just one variable in the equation. Also, the term ""market power"" is often used to describe why the price of one product can be raised substantially over its marginal cost, while the price of another product cannot.  In a perfect competitive market, *no* brand will have market power. But in the real world, what market power means is that a company can increase the price of a product *without* losing customers.  Finding that sweet spot - maximum increase in sales price over marginal cost without reducing your market share - is quite scientific, as opposed to a couple of guys sitting in a back room throwing out some random numbers (which is what OP - somewhat naively - seems to think is happening here).

&gt;crappy designs made in China

definitely some made-in-China designs are crappy, but others are not. Ch-fi quality is sometimes bad  but sometimes not.

Also, Woo Audio products are not made in China (unless Brooklyn seceded when I wasn't looking).

There's a reason tube amps, especially transformer-coupled tube amps are expensive - because parts are *actually* expensive (even without the markup). Well-made transformers are expensive. Capacitors with tight tolerances for tube-level (high) voltages are expensive. Even some of the thick aluminum enclosures you see on high end tube amps are expensive to machine. All of that adds up. Plus have you seen the prices for NOS tubes? Some of them can get *really* pricey (priced any VT52s or 300Bs lately?)

Having said this, high-end products in *any* retail domain have bigger markups than low-end products, whether you are talking about audio gear or cars or watches or fountain pens or whatever.

&gt;even 100% markup seems excessive to me

what's excessive to you may not be excessive to others. Obviously there are folks willing to pay the big prices for audio gear, which is why there are folks selling them at highly inflated prices. As with any supply and demand equation, if there is a demand then prices will be higher than if there isn't a demand. Welcome to capitalism.

1978,"Compared to the original Vali, the Vali 2 is not a small step for man, but a giant leap for mankind. Yes I know Purrin thought the original Vali was all that and then some, but IMO he was just full of schiit when he made that statement (sorry marv, could not resist). The original vali had a fatal flaw - the tube had god-awful microphonics, and if you got a vali with ringing (which most people did) then you couldn't really pay attention to the music because you were distracted by the microphonics that rang like the bells of St Clements. And St Martins. And Old Bailey. And Shoreditch and Stepney and Bow all going off at the same time.

The Vali 2 is a step up because it uses a more robust tube that isn't just hanging off the PCB by a couple of wires. But at its core, it still has a flaw that's hard to overlook.

You see, the problem with a hybrid amp like the Vali2 is that it is neither fish nor fowl. It lacks the clean sound of SS amps, even the most basic SS amps like the Magni or the O2. And it lacks the warm gooey smeared distorted-but-oh-so-good sound you get from *real* tube amps, even (relatively) cheap ones like the Little Dot 3 or the Crack.

So what you have is this: IMO the Vali2 is like a [GMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism) tomato. It sounds a little tubey, because the tube does distort the sound, but just enough to be audible. It's not night-and-day, its more like having a little snippet of cow genome in your tomato to keep it fresher longer, but when you cut the tomato it wont bleed, and it sure doesn't taste like wagyu.

So my opinion about the Vali 2 is a little different than that of the typical Schiit fanboy - I say fuggedaboutit. Get a decent solid state amp as your first amp (you dont have to break the bank, the magni or O2 are perfectly viable options) and then if you desire tube sound, save up and build a crack or get a LD3 or a WA3 (if you want an OTL) or a WA6 if you want a transformer coupled tube amp. 

And if you are buying a tube amp just so that you can roll tubes, then again avoid the vali2, because you are not going to hear a huge difference between tubes (remember, the solid state components do all the heavy lifting). Instead get a LD3 or Crack instead and spend all thats left of your checking account happily snapping up NOS tubes on fleabay.

To be fair, the vali 2 is better than the hybrid competition at its price point. But that's not to difficult - after all, it competes with the likes of the EF2A, which is, well, how do I put this politely, an abomination.

And its a clever design for a hybrid. Plate voltage is a satisfying 60V, not a pitifully low voltage like some other hybrids deliver.  And the Vali2s discrete hybrid design works in a current-mode state, which means it can pump out 1W at 32 ohms, enough even for planars.

Except the HE6. Whenever you say ""even for planars"" you have to add the obligatory disclaimer ""except the HE6"", because it takes the entire output of a medium-sized nuclear reactor to power the HE6.

1981,"I liked the A17 when I checked it out a while ago. Here's what I had to say about it at the time:

The A17 is an interesting offering from Sony, obviously throwing down a challenge to the Fiios and the iBassos, and shall I say it...the Ponos of the world?

After my disappointing experience with the ZX1 (tl;dr: I bought it after drooling over it for months, and ended up returning it, sigh) I have become a tad leery of Sony's audiophile offerings. The ZX2 is at a price point that can only be described as ""A&amp;K crazy"" but the A17 slots itself nicely at the heels of the Fiio X3 or the iBasso DX50.

It's not internet enabled, though, like the ZX1 was. And it doesn't run Android but a version of the old Sony firmware that I have become familiar with since my NWZ-S616 days.

It does allow you to play almost every audiophile format you can throw at it, including flac and alac and aac (thankfully no ATRAC crap), although it doesn't support DSD. Which is not surprising, because how many DSD songs can you get into that 64GB memory? Four? Five? :-)

You can extend memory with a 128GB SDXC card though, although that adds to the cost. But you have to admit that 192GB is plenty of shelf space even for the most die hard audiophiles (you know the ones that are cybernetically connected to their 1st gen iPod classics)

Battery life is the bane of these devices (except my trusty old Cowon D2, which has the kind of battery life you would expect a nuclear powered aircraft carrier to have) but the A17 manages a healthy theoretical 50 hours. I say theoretical because when i was trying it out, it lasted only about 20 hours or thereabouts. I have no idea if that is par for the course or not.

I'm typically not a fan of the gimmicky digital processing that Sony does, for example DSEE, but its amplification design for the A17, including the so-called HMaster HX digital amplification, is on the money. Check out how Sony implemented the amp topology, its pretty cool, for example they used a [POSCAP capacitor] (http://industrial.panasonic.com/ww/products/capacitors/conductive-polymer-electrolytic-capacitors/conductive-polymer-tantalum-solid-capacitors-poscap) as the charge pump.

The interface is more intuitive than the crap on my X3 (Sorry X3 fanboys, but you know that even with the firmware update, the X3 interface is, well, crap) but it is still somewhat clunky. The screen is tiny but well illuminated (OLED?) but even though you can view video, i wouldn't use the A17 as a video player any more than I would use it as a smartphone.

Overall the sound is remarkably neutral. Highs are crisp (something I found lacking with the ZX1) and detail is superb. The only minuses are that it struggles to power even moderate impedance headphones, and there is an irritating hint of a hiss with exacting IEMs (floor noise is what killed the ZX1 for me as well). Which is frustrating, because if you can't pair audiophile DAPs with something like the Shure SE535 (which is great but nitpicks when it comes to floor noise) then what would you pair it with?

I suppose the A17 should be on the shortlist for folks looking at a standalone DAP, and I do prefer it to my X3 (which is languishing in a drawer somewhere because every time I use it I end up more irritated than happy). But I ended up passing on it for three reasons.

 First, from a price performance perspective its hard to look beyond the Fiio X1, or even the NWZE385, which doesn't allow lossless files but then how many people critically listen to flac files when they are on the go anyway? 

Second, the lack of internet access is irritating, because most of my on-the-go music now comes from streaming services. The A17 does have Bluetooth streaming though, but I did not test it. 

But third (and probably most tellingly), it still doesn't demonstrate a compelling advantage over my Cowon D2, which has been my DAP workhorse for a *long* time now, mainly because I can't find anything better

But oh yes, one thing I learned during my time with the A17 is that it has an FM tuner. Who knew FM radio still existed?",2016-03-08 05:43:08+00:00,d0rrce4,1.0,t3_49fbdn,24414.0,headphones

*1.""Balanced setups reduce crosstalk""*

yes but crosstalk is typically never an issue, so using it as the reason for preferring balanced is somewhat disingenuous because it fixes a problem that does not exist. I hear this same reasoning to justify RCA over 1/8"" or 1/4"" TRS cable, and that argument is equally disingenuous.

Now if you are running cable from here to China, I entirely agree that a balanced setup is preferred.


*2.""I hear both balanced and single ended outputs and the balanced clearly sounds better""*

balanced is often louder at the same pot level than single ended which gives folks the illusion that balanced out is better. If you adjust for volume, they sound the same

*3.""Balanced output adds 'airiness' to the sound""'*

the original reason for balanced designs was to reject interference, not to provide ""more airiness"" or ""holographic sound"", or whatever this month's  flavor is at the bullshittery.

Next, decide what your fundamental philosophy is going to be. Do you want to accept freebies and review units? Or will you be buying your own gear?

Then Senn discontinued the 555/595 and replaced them with the 558/598. And sure enough, a bunch of posts popped up on head fi that said removing the foam in the 558 turned them into the 598 (although no mod in the universe can make the 598 not look like an early 80s Buick roadmaster)

And since 558s were on sale pretty much all the time a couple of years ago, I said why not, it will be a fun mod to do.

One thing you notice when you open up the 558 is that the insides of the cups and grille design are shaped a little differently compared to the 598. 

Doing the foam mod on the 558 takes away some of the smoothness of the 558 sound and makes it sound more granular and rough. And it *does not* sound the same as the 598. I don't think the 558 is a 598 plus a couple of pieces of foam. They both have modestly different but distinctly audible differences in their sound profile, and pulling the foam from a pair of 558s does not create a 598.

tl;dr: if you have a 558, the foam mod does not make it sound exactly like a 598. If you want a 598, get a 598.",2016-03-04 18:09:57+00:00,d0nlcno,1.0,t3_48wmt7,31981.0,headphones

2069,"Another day, another Audeze with QC issues

&lt;*sigh*&gt;

Its never OK to have crappy QC, but consumers tend to overlook QC issues with cheap products. ""It was only fifty bucks"" they say to console themselves, or ""it was made in China, what did you expect?""

They forget that QC is a philosophy, not a phenomenon. There are many companies that make cheap or high volume products that pay close attention to QC processes. Even in China.

But then you have companies that brand themselves as ""premium"" and seek to operate in the rarefied stratosphere of the retail market. Consumers are surprisingly demanding when it comes to the quality of the ""premium"" products they buy - whether it is cars or headphones or soap. You can't really charge a premium for being top-of-the-line and get away with consistent QC lapses.

Which is why companies like Hifiman have an image problem. As long as they were churning out cheap-ass products noone complained about their QC, but now Fang wants to be the ""Sennheiser of the East"" and everyone gripes about terrible Hifiman product quality (didn't you know that already before you jumped in to buy that HE560?)

But at least Hifiman is going the disruptive innovation route (this is where Clayton Christensen gets to say ""I told you so"") and trying to transition from bottom-of-the-barrel to top-of-the-line. Audeze is taking a different pathway. They started off as the ultra-premium top-end summit-fi folks and as a consequence are expected to have stellar QC, and so for them the only way has been, well, down.

Which is a shame, because Audeze, more than most other headphone companies, deserves its ""summit-fi"" niche. If you think about it, when they were introduced the LCD2 and 3 their headphones were nothing short of magical in comparison to the competition, and Audeze was single-handedly responsible for the planar arms race you see today.

tl;dr: Sankar, fix your QC. then fix folks perception that Audeze QC sucks (hint: marketing!). In the long run, that's more important than collaborating with BMW or releasing a slew of new products.

You could also crack open the earpiece and solder the cable directly to the terminal (probably the best way to go if you know what you are doing)

Things become even more complicated when you look at companies operating outside the US and EU, and at ""grey market"" companies that sell a product in one country at retail, and ship it to another country under cover of their ebay storefront (thus voiding warranty status).

There's a reason companies are going the kickstarter/indiegogo route - it's a lot easier (and a lot less work) than getting financing the traditional way.

And, of course, Light Harmonic has taught me that indiegogo campaigns can be the ultimate bait-and-switch.

Having said this, Centrance, unlike many other campaigns I have been seeing over the last year or two, actually have some skin in the game and the prior business experience so they will probably do what they are saying they will do.

tl;dr: indiegogo isn't like retail or like an investment. In essence the best way I can describe it is that you are placing a bet, and there is a possibility that you may not get what you want, when they said you would get it. Don't think of it as a sure thing.

2137,"The mini i design is clearly inspired by [Bel Canto] (http://www.osageaudio.com/images/Bel%20Canto/e.One%20Componets%20In%20Black%2001.jpg). 

This is a good deal for the price. The mini i is a solid dac/amp with dual AD1955 DAC chips, balanced and single ended out, USB/optical/coax/AES in (controlled by an XMOS chip), a digital pot, a great display, and an optional remote.

My favorite feature - when I plug my headphones in, it automatically mutes the RCA/XLR out, and *remembers the individual volume settings* for line out and headphones out.  I like this because I usually use the mini i at my computer/console station, which has active speakers. Its easier to change volume on the mini i than it is to change them on the speakers themselves, and I can blast my speakers and not worry about destroying my ears when I plug my headphones in.

Unlike many other amps, the display is really useful and not just for show.

For the same price as the O2+ODAC it beats the combo for features. It is relatively futureproof (supports DXD but not DSD, for that you will need to get the Sabre-DAC equipped mini i pro).

And to be fair, I should note that my mini i failed after I bought it (bad USB chip) and went back to China to be fixed. I did not buy it from Massdrop, but from the authorized dealer, who was a pleasure to work with and made the whole RMA process really painless.

And note that the output impedance is 12 ohms.

But having said all this, two more caveats. First, if you want a purely transparent, neutral setup, the ODAC + O2 may be all you need. 

And second, despite the fact that I think the mini i is great and that I got great customer service from the seller, it still failed a short while after I bought it. If that's an isolated case, no big deal. If not, then that's an issue.

IMO there isn't a huge advantage to going balanced, but if you do, its hard to find a decent balanced amp for under $1000. The mini i has balanced XLR outs in the back that you can use to test out a balanced setup.  Unlike many cheaper balanced amps, the mini i is truly balanced, all the way through the audio pathway. 

Personally I liked the AD1955 over the Sabre ES9016 DAC on the mini i pro fir two reasons - firstly I didnt care much for the DSD capability and second I already own a few Sabre DACs, so the AD1955 configuration was more interesting to me. 

I didnt get the mini i remote because my Logitech harmony controls the mini i just fine.

I still use my mini i in my amp/dac rotation once in a while, which is saying something because its been a while since I bought it and usually I move on to new toys rather quickly. Having owned it for a while, IMO its biggest con: it does have some floor noise so if you have finicky IEMs I would not recommend it.

2152,"TBH, I'm not a fan of earbuds. Most of them have crappy sound quality, and the exceptions (like some of the Yuin models) have crappy build quality. Plus, you can get cheap IEMs that do everything earbuds can, and more. Plus the SQ of stock Apple earbuds isn't that bad, when you consider the competition. So I typically look at IEMs to provide a portable solution and not earbuds.

But some folks can't tolerate IEMs. Either they get ear irritiation, or IEMs are painful, or they get ear infections...what are these people to do?

Well, they could settle for crappy earbuds. Or not. 

I bought me a pair of Amazon premium headphones (although why Amazon calls them ""Premium"" at this price point is beyond me) when they first came out (Amazon had them on a lightning deal of $10, which is a price point where I usually give in to curiosity without thinking too much about the consequences of my actions).  

Here's what I had to say about them:

****

***[Ebony And Ivory Live Together In Perfect Harmony](http://i.imgur.com/9NH9lFl.jpg)***

****

First impressions of the Amazon Premium Headphone - Note: **Please listen to [this song] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZtiJN6yiik) when reading this post.**

****

Now I'm not a huge fan of earbuds, but I do like the current generation Apple EarPods. They are well designed, and, more importantly, sound surprisingly good for earbuds. So when Amazon recently dropped a lightning deal on its [Premium Headphones] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HX0SRXW) for a mere $10, I had to check it out to see how it compared against Jony Ive and company.

****

**We All Know That People Are The Same Where Ever We Go**

The biggest problem I have with earbuds is the fit. Most people cannot get them to sit securely in the acoustic meatus (the triangular depression of the pinna of the ear between the [tragus, the antitragus and the concha] (http://sonoworld.com/images/FetusItemImages/article-images/face_and_neck/ear_anu_patil_images/ear_anatomy.gif) in a way that offers any kind of seal, and so earbuds typically sound tinny and distant compared to IEMs. And since they offer little isolation, folks tend to increase the volume of the music they are listening to in order to compensate for ambient noise. Which in turn frequently leads to distortion, further degrading sound quality.

But the same factors that place earbuds at a disadvantage can also be advantages in certain situations. There are times when you don't want excessive isolation, and earbuds offer portability and convenience in a way that open full sized headphones can never achieve.

****


**There Is Good And Bad In Everyone**

The Amazon Premium Headphones are packaged well, in an attractive black container made of thin card stock, with a profile image of the earpods subtly etched in bas relief. The packaging opens up to reveal black glossy earbuds, with no accessories. 

These earbuds were clearly ""inspired"" by the Apple EarPods. Build quality is excellent, with the inner face of the earbuds mirroring a dark quasi-ceramic look, just like the Apple EarPods. The ends are more angular than Apple EarPods, and the Amazon earbuds don't have the long stem that Apple EarPods do. Amazon earpods have two slit-like bass ports, one on the inside face and one up top, in comparison to the three vents on the EarPort.

The ends of the Amazon earbuds are magnetized, and so they conveniently stick to each other, which makes them easier to carry around when not listening (with the cable around the neck and the earbuds magnet-snapped together like a necklace). I can also put one earbud inside my front pocket and snap it to the other outside: the magnetic bond holds through the cloth even when I am walking around. Its a super convenient feature. Round cables from the buds terminate in a 3 button control, and then emerge as a flat cable to the TRRS 1/8 inch connector. The connector has a narrow lip so I can plug it into my phone easily. 

Amazon earbuds are optimized for the Amazon Fire phone. The play/pause button works on the  iPhone and some android phones, but YMMV with the other buttons.


****

**We Learn To Live, We Learn To Give**


The cables feel slinky to touch, and microphonics are mild to moderate. The flat cable is supposed to be less likely to tangle in theory. In real life, we know that *all* cables tangle, it is a law of nature that cannot be opposed, like gravity or the cuteness of kittens.

The earbuds feel comfortable against the ear. The cable hangs easily from the intertragic notch (the v-notch of the ear) without discomfort. Seal is, well, a joke, like any other earbud. Ambient noise is clearly audible. Buttons emit a reassuring haptic ""click"" when you press on them. Cord length is appropriate.

****

**What We Need To Survive**

On first listen, Apple EarPods and the Amazon earbuds sound surprisingly similar. But with some extended A/B testing, differences become apparent. 

Specifically,  bass on the Amazon earbuds is not as boomy as on the Apple EarPods, and sub bass is virtually non-existant. The Amazon earbuds overall have a smoother tone, and high end rolloff is earlier and more prominent. Mids, and particularly vocals are a tad recessed, although they are not mildly distorted as they are with Apple EarPods.  Instruments in classical performances sound somewhat artificial. 

Overall, these are a good option for folks looking for a smoother sounding pair of earbuds. They will never be my first choice for listening to music, but at $10 IMO they are a steal in comparison to the $30 Apple EarPod. 

The best thing about these: The magnetic ends of the buds are a nice design feature, and very convenient.

2162,"This is the Achilles heel of buying something from China - if it works well you get a great deal that often ends up being a price-performance champ, but if something goes wrong then suddenly all that ""value"" evaporates into thin air like an ice cube in the Mojave. In July.

If both the company and the customer are in the US, or in the EU, or in one of a multitude of other countries, there are clear avenues for restitution available both to the buyer as well as the seller. But when you buy internationally from China, things can get a little murky. Even the cost of two-way shipping from the US to China can be prohibitive, let alone the cost of a repair not covered by the warranty.

This is why I like buying chi-fi from masssdrop. Yes its grey market, yes you don't get a manufacturer's warranty, but if something goes wrong then you deal with MD in San Francisco, California, not kingwa in Foshan, Guangdong. And one thing's for sure, shipping to New Jersey (which is where Massdrop's warehouse is located) is a ***lot*** cheaper than  shipping to the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone.

Having said this, the reputation of small companies depends on aftermarket feedback and customer satisfaction. I have no idea if there is an issue with the MAster 11 or not, but if I were audio-gd I would make sure that I pull a few ""problem"" Master 11s from the hands of customers and test them. If they check out OK, then everyone heaves a sigh of relief and it's business as usual. And even if they don't, it's an opportunity for the company to fix an issue sooner rather than later.

And before the chi-fi bashers come out and say *""it's a Chinese-made product, what did you expect, we told you so!""* let me tell you another story. I bought my Matrix mini i from the Matrix US distributor. After a short while, the USB chip failed. Matrix asked for the unit to be shipped back so that they could figure out what was wrong and fix it. It took a while  - insert lyrics from [*Slow Boat To China*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjKkdRwbAEs) here - but they did fix it.

2164,"&gt;I am going to try a few Mullards soon

you wont regret it. The M8100s are a nice alternative to the Voskhod rockets

I do prefer the Svetlana/ Novosibirsk 6Zh1Ps to the Voskhods - they are identifiable by a pentagon logo or what looks like a stylized letter ""G"" printed on the glass. They are the polar opposite of the warm Mullard CV4010s. They are remarkably neutral, and with very detailed bass. They can make a tube amp sound very ""un-tubey"" (OK I just made that word up, but it fits). For detailed listening with an exacting pair of headphones like the HD600 (which shows up recording flaws for exactly what they are) they are great.

Voskhod 6Zh1P-EVs are the ones with the rocket logo on the paper carton, and also sometimes with a military rhombus logo on the glass. These were made in Voskhod's Kaluga plant and if they have a gold grid, they are very clean and (relatively) neutral too, and cheaper on ebay than the (rare) Svetlanas.

The Novosibirsk plant (now NEVZ-Soyuz) has an interesting history. During world war 2, the Russians moved production of a lot of essential war components from Europe to Siberia. The original Svetlana factory was in St Petersburg (then Leningrad) and in the early 1940s was moved lock-stock-and-barrel to Novosibirsk in Siberia. Look up Novosibirsk on Google Maps, it is in the middle of nowhere, a prefect place to set up a strategic factory safe from enemy attack yet close enough to resources. They have stayed there ever since the 40s.",2016-02-25 02:34:48+00:00,d0csjh7,4.0,t1_d0cqywn,2475.0,headphones

TBH, the answer is more dependent on the size and shape of your head than anything else. It's really hard for some folks to find headphones that fit them well and aren't uncomfortable, and they don't all have heads like Shrek either.

In general, look for larger circumaural (around the ear models) with a padded headband and a wider headband arc than your G430s. Some folks will swear by velour, others by memory foam, but just because someone thinks that velour pads are softer than a babys bottom, it doesnt necessarily mean that you will have the same experience too.

In reality, the only way you will be sure is to check the headphones in question out.

If you live near a store that sells headphones (doesnt have to be high end, even a best Buy or Guitar center will do), spend some time one day trying out a bunch of headphones - will give you a sense of what design characteristics you need to specifically look out for when you order headphones online.",2016-02-24 05:42:53+00:00,d0bnbvc,1.0,t3_47a787,12795.0,headphones

enjoying *anything* is directly correlated with quality of life

and clearly music has the power to move us emotionally

so just as music can sometimes move us one way and be soothing or satisfying, why at other times when our mental and emotional balance is, well, off-balance,  can't it move us the other way and be jarring or unsatisfying?


&gt;Quality of life is what i measure everything in

we are fortunate to be able to engage in what is, in essence, a first world hobby. There are those who are so busy trying to just survive that they have no thought for quality of life, or music, or happiness, for them hunger is not a comfortable option to optimize body fat but a constant gnawing reminder of how life has dealt them a really crappy hand of cards (a different kind of schiit stack, so to speak).

****

It's yours and mine this fate

Destiny that binds us

While it is denied

The strings of a guitar

A guitar singing

It was soon lost

Feel like crying

Oh people of my land

This sadness which I carry on

Was from you that I received

2270,"Fair enough. 

Although to be fair I should also probably add that the bottom line is that  if you want to review audio equipment, there are only 2 ways to get your hands on gear - either you buy it, or you get a freebie. This is an expensive hobby, and not everyone can afford to buy all the stuff that they are attracted to.

But then if you get freebies from folks, then you are pretty much beholden to them and *have* to shill for them - and this applies whether you get a free pair of headphones or major sponsorship for your website.

And once you start playing this game, typically you are trapped - if you badmouth their products you will, in essence kill the goose that lays the golden eggs because they will stop sending you freebies or checks in the mail.

And things become even more ethically grey if you want to make an income by reviewing. Now you are not only dependent on folks  for freebies, but you also need to find a way to squeeze $$$ from your followers, either by getting cutbacks from discount codes or by monetizing your links and embedding affiliate links in them, or by outright begging for money (which is what a patreon account effectively boils down to). It's not easy making a living by reviewing audio products, at least ethically,.

Which is why I consider myself lucky - I can afford to buy the stuff I want to, and so I can say what I want without feeling like I have a conflict of interest every time I say something. 

But then folks like me typically have no desire to be professional reviewers, because we already have other jobs that allow us to feed our hobbies. So then you are up against the same dilemma - most of the folks who *want* to do this professionally (the ones whose youtube videos you want to watch or reviews you want to read) are trapped into the same elitist ecosystem that exists in audiophilia today.

tl;dr: pay-for-play (when reviewers take freebies or $ in exchange for their reviews) is indeed an unfortunate blight upon this hobby, but IMO it is a necessary evil to prevent the hobby from being entirely elitist.",2016-02-19 17:35:41+00:00,d062h6j,4.0,t1_d061rc9,960.0,headphones

differences between 535 and 535LTD

there are supposed to be 2 versions of the 535LTD - the US version (with a black cable) and the Asian version (with a white cable). The Asian version is supposed to be tuned differently than the regular 535, but I have only heard the US version and so can only compare the regular 535 with it.

IMO the US LTD has modestly elevated bass compared to the regular 535 - it is nuanced and not overt. The high end sounds exactly the same -I  auditioned  the LTD mainly to check out if what I had read on headfi - that the LTD had enhanced treble compared to regular versions - was true. I couldn't really hear a difference.

***

And this, ladies and gentlemen (or should I say, *lady* and gentlemen, because there aren't many of the former in this hobby) is the fatal flaw of the Q701. While many folks (like me) don't mind the bumps on the headband, for some it is more fiendish than anything the writers of *Game of Thrones* could devise. Some have gone as far as to say that the official marketing slogan of the Q701 should be ""*Designed in Austria. Built In China. Endorsed by ~~Quincy Jones~~ Torquemada.*"". OK I made that up, but you get the idea.

A multitude of DIY fixes have been devised to mitigate the pain inflicted by the Q701 headband. Zeos suggested [home insulation tape](http://www.amazon.com/Frost-King-R734H-Sponge-Rubber/dp/B0000CBIFD) cut into pieces and mounted between the bubbles. Others have suggested [major surgery](http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i214/bradbrown07_2006/DSC_0168.jpg) or even [replacing the entire headband assembly](http://i.imgur.com/kTyGH6x.jpg). 

A few days ago /u/wondroushippo posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/45dgo0/is_this_the_akg_q701_headband_cover_weve_always/) so of course I had to head over [to Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Headband-Adjustable-Sennheiser-Beyerdynamic/dp/B01ANBS8QI/) and check it out. 

For 10 bucks, you get a decent rugged padded headband cover with 4 velcro ties. It fits the Q701 headband perfectly. And once the pad is on, you can't feel the bumps anymore. 

There's just one small con that prevents this from being the ideal solution - once the pad is on, the universal headband (which uses rubber bands on each side to stretch) has to stretch more than usual, so it feels like your earpads are constantly being pulled *upwards*. I expect them to go flying towards the ceiling with a [whoosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUvGRJJUAo) any second.

I'm going to leave the headband pad on and use the Q701 for a while (I am guilty of neglecting my stormtrooper Quincy, it has been sitting in my closet for a while now) on to see if stretching the headband over time will reduce the  tension of the rubber bands and the upward pulling sensation.

If it does, I cannot recommend this pad strongly enough. It will end the global epidemic of CQHPS (Chronic Q701 Headband Pain Syndrome) for ever. And maybe even prevent a few permanently deformed skulls.

2341,"&gt;WA3 is less costly option, WA6 for OTC



TBH the WA3 offers nothing over the crack or the LD3, except the $300+ price premium. 6AS7 means less options to tube roll (and more expensive tubes) than the LD3. Instead of getting the WA3, I would save the money and get a Crack or LD3 and better headphones (or a better DAC, if you are so inclined). 

Valhalla2 is also cheaper to tube roll than the WA3 but I didnt include the vally 2 in the comparison because the WA3 has a warmer tone similar to the crack or the LD3.

The WA6 IMO occupies a funny position in the woo lineup. It begs you to buy the Princess Sophia tube upgrade (have you seen it light up at night? It is mesmerizing) and that racks the price up to $860, at which point the WA6SE is only around $300 more, and obviously worth the upgrade (logic dictates that if you have $900 of discretionary money lying around, you are probably not going to sweat $ 1100).  And then suddenly you are above price-performance territory.

maybe. And they are definitely not jumping the shark anytime soon. Their parent corporation Foster Electric, is probably one of the biggest companies you have never heard of.

In the FY ending 3/15, the biggest chunk of Foster Electric's sales were from communciation hardware (eg headsets) and automotive components (eg car audio). That accounted for about 85% of total sales, which for these 2 segments added up to around 83 billion yen. 

Then came TV audio (speaker units for TV), with around 11% of sales or 10 billion yen, and finally at the bottom the Fostex unit with audiophile and OEM sales - 3% of sales or around 3 billion yen.

So although Fostex is a big deal to us, they are only 3%, sales wise, of Foster electric.

Plus some companies realize the marketing + hype value that massdrop brings to the table (fostex, grace audio, akg and orient come to mind) and they are essentially gaining from their participation in drops, not losing.

but of course, stranger things have happened in audioland, and I can relate stories where folks who were once mortal enemies have become, well, brothers (if you think that's an insane plot twist, have you seen any Bollywood movies lately?).

Your Z97 motherboard probably powers it just fine, though. An external dac/amp may tighten bass a little, and reduce noise floor / EMI noise, but those are attributes more for critical listening - for CSGO it's not going to make any real difference to soundstage, or offer you a significant positional cue advantage when compared to powering the G4mezeros off your motherboard.

the best solution IMO if you find many full size headphones uncomfortable with glasses = use IEMs

but TBH how comfortable your headphones are with glasses really depend on a number of variables - the shape of the pads, clamp forxe, the shape of your head, the shape and size of the stems of your glasses, etc.

I have found that every headphone is different - some work well with glasses, and some don't. If you have a pair of thin-rimmed metal glasses with the wire stems, that might be the most compatible with over-ear headphones

I find on-ear headphones to be more uncomfortable with glasses than around ears, especially those that clamp a little, like the martin logan mikros",2016-02-13 19:03:30+00:00,czypfqq,1.0,t3_45lnm7,4614.0,headphones

In many cases, though, grey market products are identical to the stuff that is sold by authorized dealers.

But companies factor in the cost of warranty servicing into pricing, and sometimes they are happy to unload units into the grey market at a slightly discounted price, because they don't have to deal with warranty-related issues.

TBH unless I have a great recording (Telarc, I'm looking at you!) to listen to, I don't see the value of listening to classical music with a super analytic pair of headphones like the HD800, because they bring out every technical deficiency of the recordings. For example, my newest acquisition is a version of Cavalleria Rusticana with Benjamin Gigli and Lisa Bruna Rasa. It's a recording I have been hunting for a while, because , well, Gigli at La Scala conducted by Mascagni in his twilight years. 

But it's a scratchy recording from 1940 and the vinyl I have isn't in the best condition. Plus Seraphim were never renowned for the quality of their pressings to start with. It is painful to listen to with my super analytical headphones, but the HD650 is a lot more forgiving.

Close your mouth so that your teeth are close together. Now direct a stream of air with your tongue towards your teeth. Hear that annoying ""ssssss"" sound? That's sibilance.

This was no scientific test published in a technical paper. This was some dude posting on a forum (Audioholics) that his alleged brother was an alleged audio engineering whiz and that they had apparently conducted some kind of quasi-experiment that a 12 year-old would understand does not have any genuine scientific methodology, where they concluded that coat hanger wires were just as good as expensive cables. The post was signed by a ""Bob Dean"", who has since been somewhat elusive and impossible to ID as a real person.

Don't get me wrong, I don't believe the mumbo-jumbo pseudo-science bullshit that many high end cable manufacturers spew online claiming to be ""scientific proof"" for their crackpot theories. But I also get weary of folks quoting a random online forum post from some anonymous dude as ""absolute scientific proof"" of the null hypothesis.

The funny thing is that this story has been circulating as absolute fact since the mid 2000s. If I had $1 for every time I have heard ""coat hanger"" equated with ""proof"" I could probably buy me some Audioquests. Or some Siltech Emperors.

In fact, why listen to me? [Here is the original post from back in 2004](http://forums.audioholics.com/forums/threads/speakers-when-is-good-enough-enough.2512/page-2#post-15412).

2483,"Essentially there are 4 aspects to the cost of any product [1] R&amp;D [2] materials [3] manufacturing and [4] marketing.

R&amp;D is variable, so calculating the cost of R&amp;D for an individual headphone model is difficult. Newer models still haven't seen a return on ROI costs, while older models (for example HD600) have probably recouped their R&amp;D costs, and then some.

Material costs vary over time, often wildly, and are subject to supply and demand constraints.

Production costs also vary, for example Q701s were made in Austria, but AKG wanted to save costs and moved production to China. But moving production to China does not necessarily make things cheaper, for example some Audio Gd amps probably cost more to make than equivalent Schiit amps, even though Schiit makes its stuff in the US and Audio Gd in China.

Many companies OEM some or all of production, which again affects costs depending on who they OEM to. And it's not just a case of folks using cheap Chinese OEMs -- some Denons were OEMd by Fostex, for example. And keep in mind that OEM companies typically conduct their own R&amp;D, have their own design costs, have to retool equipment for specific products, etc, which changes cost calculations.

And finally marketing: some companies spend more on marketing (e.g. Apple, Nike, Beats) and make huge profits, while others spend very little on traditional marketing and still manage to do very well for themselves.

tl;dr: good luck finding this info out unless you are an industry insider, and even then you will have issues trying to calculate true product cost of your competitors.",2016-02-09 07:16:04+00:00,czt8085,1.0,t3_44vgwx,1078.0,headphones

2511,"&gt;there was a guy there that I would say was a bit pretentious

just one guy? This is a pretentious hobby. if you don't believe me, head out to headfi or SBAF - they are both equally pretentious in their own way. But you can't blame them, typically *all of audiophilia* is pretentious. Try walking into a hi-fi store. While there are some notable exceptions, most hi fi salesmen will want to have little do do with you if they don't think you can bring $$$ to the table. And by $$$ I mean $$$$$$$$$$.

But it's not just audiophilia. Almost every niche hobby is elitist - and for a reason. If you want to get ""top of the line"" stuff, you have to shell out the big bucks. Whether your hobby happens to be headphones or speakers or automatic watches or fountain pens or cars or 1st edition books or whatever.

Having said this, two things to consider. First, audiophilia is dying because not enough younger folks (even those with disposable incomes) are replacing the folks who are leaving the hobby, or dying, or both (did I mention audiophila is traditionally a hobby for old privileged men?). 

And second, not every meet is elitist, and not every online forum is elitist. One of the reason I hang out here is because most of the folks here don't reek of the stereotypical audiophile - you know, [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/vZk0DBF.png).

So don't get disheartened. Everyone has sto start somewhere. And your X2s and iPod classic are as good a starting point as someone else's setup. Forget about the snobs, and TBH, forget about the gear. Next time you are at a meet, go around and just listen to good music. *Really listen*. You'll learn more about musical preferences - both yours and those of others - and will be in a position to appreciate the hobby better. And remember, audiophilia is like any other club. In the beginning, folks aren't necessarily inclusive and everyone looks and sounds like an elitist. But over time, you will learn to spot the difference between genuinely nice people (there are a lot of them around in this hobby) and the folks with buttplugs (there are a lot of those, too). And you will learn to avoid the latter and hang out with the former. And you will have fun.

My problem with the g4meone is that you are paying a rather stiff premium just for buying a ""gaming"" headset. 

I'll explain what I mean. lets say you are buying a g4meone from Amazon today for $168. 

Instead you could buy a HD558 for $94, a modmic for $45 and for $140 have a setup that is comparable - with modestly better SQ. The only tradeoff is that IMO Senn makes pretty decent microphones, and while th midmic is no slouch the g4meone has a marginally better mic - not that you'll notice because you are probably not going to use the mic to record an aria from *The Barber Of Seville*.

Plus, have you actually seen the g4mezero IRL? I know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but to me it looks just plain *weird*.

2694,"My vote for the ultimate price-performance portable champion goes to the KSC75. For a bunch of reasons.

1. It is frequently on sale and at times the price goes down to $15 here in the US. That's a lot of performance for very little price.

2. For fifteen bucks, you get surprisingly good sound - it's smooth, natural, warm, with decent bass given it's design. The high end is a little grainy but without sibilance or harshness, the bass is engaging and devoid of bloat, although it drops off a little sooner than you might like. Overall the profile is pleasing, non-fatiguing and fun. Bonus: if you lose it or break it, why at the price you paid you probably won't care much.

3. The best part of the KSC75 is that it can sound even better with the Kramer mod. Bonus: if you kill it when performing Kramer mod surgery, why at the price you paid you probably won't care much.

4. Some folks don't like the clip-on style of wear. For them, there's always the headband mod with the Parts Express headband that converts the KSC75 into a more traditional pair of on-ears.  Bonus: if those little plastic retainers break when you are clipping on the Parts Express headband, why at the price you paid you probably won't care much.

It does have some cons, though.

1. First, it's a $15 pair of headphones. And it looks like it.

2. Realistically, you are not going to get $1000 value for $15. Sure, it punches above its weight class, but if you are expecting to Kramer mod the KSC75 and have it sound like a pair of SE846s, that ain't gonna happen. Bonus: if you use a pair of expensive IEMs on the go and you lose them, you will cry yourself a river of tears. I know because I have been there, and indeed created an entire lotic ecosystem with my salty discharges over the years. But if you lose your KSC75, why at the price you paid you probably won't care much.

3. It's an entirely open design, which means sound leaks in, and sound leaks out. Isolating it is not. And if you are wearing a KSC75, don't sit next to me on the plane. Please.

2805,"&gt;Mullard moved the same rigs and machines from Blackburn to Japan during the war

WW2? umm thats not really possible, Britain and Japan were fighting each other at the time, remember?

Actually it was post-WW2. In the early 50s Philips and matsushita did a deal to build a factory in Osaka.  Konosuke Matsushita was reforming Matsushita after WW2 (it became Panasonic) and sent an executive to the West to negotiate a deal for a vacuum tube plant collaboration, more to make CRTs for TVs than vacuum tubes. The executive (I forget his name) tried to do a deal with many companies in Europe and the US, but noone wanted to partner with matsushita at the time - only Philips showed any real interest.

One of the highlights of the deal was a  MEI/Philips factory that would build TV tubes, fluorescent lights, and incidentally, also vacuum tubes.  Philips gave up some Mullard tube designs to matsushita (I think in exchange for a royalty fee) but matsushita engineers messed with them a lot (and some would say improved on the mullard designs!).

And this wasnt a Mullard factory, it was a Philips/MEI collaboration but run entirely by MEI. this deal was very important to Matsushita at the time because they felt they were being trounced by Sony and setting up the factory was an attempt to gain a huge amount of prestige within Japan. It worked.

Konosuke Matsushita was a very interesting guy. If you are interested in stuff like this, there is a [great book about him](http://www.amazon.com/Matsushita-Leadership-John-P-Kotter/dp/068483460X).

2806,"&gt;  I don't think I've seen, or heard of a France factory, but it's a possibility

it's more than a possibility, it is une certitude :-)

see my other post in this thread. La Radiotechnique had a tube factory in Suresnes, France.

&gt;&gt;Mullard had factories in a bunch of countries. UK, US, and Japan that I know of off the top of my head.

That's not quite accurate.

All core Mullard factories were in the UK. The 2 main plants were at Mitcham and Blackburn, and there were also a bunch of others - off the top of my head I can think of Fleetwood, Lytham St Annes, and Southport.

Once Philips bought Mullard they enlarged the supply chain and consolidated some of their plants.  So the Tungsram plant in Tottenham, UK, became a Mullard plant. But Mullards were still made in the UK.

What you may be thinking of is the fact that Mullard also supplied a bunch of other tube factories, for example they were the feeder for Thorn AEI, marconi, english Electric, etc. But those plants were also typically in the UK.

As the tube business began to die, Philips started to cross-badge tubes as Mullards. So Amperex, RTC, Mullard, Tungsram, etc were all Philips brands, just as AKG, JBL, etc are all Harman brands.

And when Philips shut down factories, it often sold the tools and dies to other countries to manufacture their own tubes, for example BEL in India started tube production with Mullard plant tools and dies, which is why you cant really tell the difference between BEL tubes and original Mullard tubes, because they are for the most part identical. Other examples of this phenomenon were IBRAPE in Brazil and IPERPESA in Peru. These are the ones I can think of right now but there are many more such examples of how the tube industry proliferated and metastasized to many different countries before dying. And Philips had a big hand in this process.

I could write more but I think this is more than enough for now, don't you? :-)

what do we know about this, apart from the estimated $3K street price?

It's an output transformer coupled tube amp with 2 driver tubes (12AT7A) and 4 output tubes (6AQ5).

It has balanced, unbalanced and preamp out.

It has  bass and treble pots, so hardware EQ.

Specs are hard to come by. It is supposed to be able to deliver 1W output. There is a selectable switch for low, mid and high impedance headphones. I have no idea what the rated output impedance is.

Its design aesthetic is either cool retro art deco chic or gaudy nouveau rich, depending on your perspective. [You decide](http://www.manley.com/public/uploaded/products/full/56881a4969275.jpg).

Why is it so expensive? Output transformers, especially those made in house, are expensive, and it has TOTL components and materials. But you are also paying a fair premium for the manley name.

It weighs 15 lbs (most of that is probably the enclosure and the custom output transformers) so I suppose you could pick it up by those side handles and use it as a weapon, if the need arises.

Bottom line: would I buy one? Probably not, even though I do like manley gear. It just looks, well, *off* to me. But that doesn't mean I can't oooh and aaah over it :-)",2016-01-19 14:07:12+00:00,cz3wzxy,1.0,t3_41odi5,6635.0,headphones

In reality, you will never get the kind of sound improvement that you got when you went up from the 770 to the LCD2, not even when you upgraded to the Burson.

Now you have a choice. The E10 suddenly becomes the ""eyesore"" in your gear inventory, and every time you look at your headphones and then at the Burson and then at the E10, the E10 will look like the stepchild you want to feed a poisoned apple that will make it go to sleep for ever.


So I predict that you will upgrade from the E10 sooner or later, if only to make it disappear. But from a purely SQ perspective, you are already way past the threshold for the law of diminishing returns to apply, and whether you go up to a DAC with fancy sound processing like AL32 or get a DAC with more input choices or a DAC with a beefy transformer or dual DAC chips or whatever, the improvement in your sound quality is going to be more nuanced rather than night-or-day.

With two exceptions. If you get a DAC with a tube buffer or an NOS DAC, then you are looking at potentially significant difference in sound than your E10.

2864,"not sure what you mean

there are 2 kinds of noise - ambient noise that ""bleeds in"" when you are listening, and extraneous noise that is generated by your setup.

In an ideal universe,  listening occurs in a truly ""black"" environment - there is no extraneous noise from your gear, and your environment is dead silent.

But in reality, some noise invariably creeps into the system. Now isolation is entirely dependent on your gear - get a well-fitting pair of CIEMs and you will be amazed how isolated you get and how little external noise you can hear.  And get some good gear, and you will be amazed how low the floor noise is, even with finicky headphones that usually bring out noise (it's not that they enhance floor noise, it's just that they transmit it more). For example, with CIEMs on and plugged into my WA7, I can't hear anything outside the signal - no electrical noise, no mechanical noises like computer fans, no TV in the next room, no music playing downstairs. In fact the only way I know someone fired up my main listening station is when I feel the sub.

But electrical equipment also inherently has the property to produce noise. And EMI noise can be from many sources - from one or more of many components in your gear all along your audio chain, electrical noise from your USB or mains power, etc.  Motherboards are notorious for generating EMI noise.

And typically because headphones tend to attenuate external noise, what you hear the most is the floor noise from gear.

2899,"&gt;But why is audiophile journalism so terrible?

Two reasons

First, there are a lot of amateurs who are doing ""audiophile journalism"". Blog posts, one-person websites, cottage media operations - the New York Times these are not. And it shows.

Second, there is a huge barrier associated with audiophilia - gear is expensive, and if you don't have the discretionary income but want ton write or talk about audio gear in a professional way, then the only way you can do so is to either work in a hifi store or get freebies to review. But once you start accepting freebies, you are on a slippery slope - if you write what you *really* think, you will kill the goose that lays the golden freebies. So many reviewers are naturally cautious about their copy, if it is perceived that they are ""difficult"", their supply channels dry up and they can't get their hands on stuff to sustain their efforts. And so there is a natural bias towards purple prose. And I can't say I blame them for this attitude, for many it is their sole source of income.

You will be surprised how many times I post my thoughts about specific gear on this sub and end up getting a PM from someone who is doing this for a living who says something like ""why are you writing this, aren't you scared you will end up not getting any more XXX  to review?"".

I will say this - the Prime Directive of buying used headphones (or any used audio gear) is ***know the seller***. or at least, get a good sense of there sellers reputation. I don't buy half as much stuff used as I buy new, but when I buy used gear I usually do a couple of things:

[1] check the sellers reputation. Their past record IMO is the best indicator of their future record.

[2] is the price too good to be true? In that case, i usually ask myself ""what's the catch?"" and am generally more suspicious

[3] usually I'll ask for more pictures. If the seller responds, it's a good thing. I'll also often ask the seller questions to which I already know the answer. It's a good litmus test to see not only if the seller is a hobbyist like me, but also a test of the seller's honesty.

And [4], I *never* buy modded headphones unless I know who did the mod, because noob modders are just as likely to screw up their mods and then try to sell their headphones as they are to end up with a gem.

If I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about the X2 gluegate issue. Just buy the best headphones you can within your budget with a sound profile that you think will be pleasing to you.

To make things worse, both Noble and Heir have a vocal fan base, who regularly do battle on audio forums.

&gt; Considering the price of these IEMs I believe that we should be educated of these companies backgrounds.

why? what difference does it make? Every company has history. I can understand it if the company engaged in reprihensible practices, but the dirty laundry of most companies is more soap opera material than anything else. For example, Apple kicked Steve Jobs out and there was bad blood. Then after a while he went back to Apple. Does that make any difference whether you buy an apple product or not?

Mike Taibbi once said about Goldman Sachs that ""The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money."" Would that prevent you from doing business with them?

Eventually, the best consumer is an informed consumer. Companies aren't going to publically air their dirty laundry unless they have to, or their hand is forced (for example by the media).

I don't have an obvious ID for your grandma's record player, but I do know that many Muntz TVs in the 50s and 60s had custom-built wooden enclosures and those models all had the ""CP"" designation in their model number.
I assume that this was also a custom combo model. The triangles in the
radio tuning knob in the picture  are CONELRAD markings -  which stood for Control Of ELectromagnetic Radiation, an early public warning system. If the Russians bombed us, folks were supposed to tune their radios to 640 or 1240 AM to find out WTF was going down. This suggests the player is post-1951 (when CONELRAD was set up) and pre-1963 (because the CONELRAD  early warning system was shut down in 1963 and replaced by the national emergency broadcast system).

I'm going to go with a late 50s vintage, because tonearm designs got blockier in general in the 60s.

2957,"&gt;headphone tech isn't exactly progressing so fast we're going to be able to reach the point where we can plug HD 800s straight into phones

headphone tech has come a long way, though. In  the 70s and 80s, most ""audiophile"" headphones were high impedance. They were designed to be plugged into [audiophile sound stations](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130918175355-06-music-players-restricted-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg) that were huge and typically had high output impedance when it came to headphone jacks.

The product that heralded the paradigm shift in headphone design, IMO, was the walkman. For the first time people could listen to [music on the go](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130918175407-10-music-players-restricted-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg).  But there were still not that many low impedance headphones around in the 80s. Sony made a bunch, for sure, because their walkman could only power lower impedance headphones. Koss made a few (like the PortaPro). And of course Grados have been around for ever. But audiophile headphone companies like Senn and Beyer stuck to the ""tried and tested"" formula of high impedance fulkl sized headphones designed for stationary listening.

And then the rise of smartphones changed everything. Now, most manufacturers have a slew of low impedance products that can be powered by smartphones. For example, now Senn makes a PX100II that is a small portable foldable on-ear. And Beyer makes the T5p, which is a *low impedance* TOTL full sized headphone.

And one problem with relying on a monopoly (in this case Microsoft) is that you are at their mercy if they decide to kill the goose that lays your golden eggs. Audio guys in the late 90s and early 2000s were so obsessed about kmixer and the inherent flaws of Windows XP (and prior) sound stacks that they squandered mich of their time and effort on relatively useless technologies like ASIO, rather than develop viable alternatives to D3D.

Also, Creative has only itself to blame for the situation the found themselves in. They systematically sniped every competitor they had - Aureal, Sensaura, Turtle Beach, etc. - until they cornered the market. But then they were beaten at their own game by folks like Asus, and from a business perspective they literally ended up falling off the cliff that they themselves had created.

I'll cut to the chase: another budget amp/dac from Fiio, this time with a chic design instead of their usual box.

It has a PCM5102 DAC (it's sad to see Fiio going away from Wolfson but ah well, they all sound pretty much the same anyway) which can manage only 24/96 (it would be more future proof to use a dac that can manage 24 or 32/192, but ah well, you can't really tell the difference between 24/96 and 24/192 anyway). And the 5102 has been used successfully in a bunch of applications, so I'm not complaining.

The pot isn't of very high quality, it's a no-name brand (TOCOS) and not ALPS, but ah well, what can you do. Knobfeel is a little rough and the pot (at least on the Q1 I checked out) has channel imbalance on the low end, but ah well, what cheap pot doesn't?

The Fiio Hipflask can run for 30 hours + (according to Fiio) and 20 hours + (according to RL) with the 1400 mA battery. 

I'm not a huge fan of the Maxim MAX97220 chip, but ah well, it's a budget amp. It puts out 190 mW at 32 ohms, which if memory serves me right is a little less than the E11K (or A3, or whatever Fiio is calling it this week).

3077,"Agree that Axell and the Senn engineers tuning is a little bit more sophisticated than the anax mod. But IMO perceptions of the differences between the 800 an 800S are also subject to a signifiant bias. Let me explain what I mean.

Keep in mind that it's only a small fraction of discerning audiophiles (or OCD types, depending on your perspective) who find the 6k peak in the 800 to be a significant detraction from the overall sound profile. I know just as many discerning audiophiles (or OCD types, depending on your perspective)  who are perfectly happy with the stock HD800 profile.

So the real question is, who is the HD800S for? It's really a niche product within a niche product, and I will bet you an upvote that most of the folks buying it  (or thinking about buying it) are the same folks that find the 6k peak in the 800 to be irritating.

Your points are, for the most part, fair. IMO as we go down the rabbit hole of this hobby, at some point each one of us comes across a fork in the road and has to decide which path to take - try to maintain the purity of the source or mess with the sound signal to make it sound ""better"" or ""more pleasing"" or ""holographic"" or whatever the fad term of the month is for ""I want it to sound more to my taste"". 

IMO the headphone is just one variable in the equation. The source, the D/A sound processing (or phone preamplification, if that's the flavor you want to experience), the amp - they are all additional factors that help shuffle the deck, if that's what you want to do.

Like I said, there is a price-performance plateau for objective sound in this hobby which isn't hard to climb. You can get an O2+ODAC + HD600 on sale and have a respectable objectivist setup for around $500. The fact that folks spend $$$$$$ just to get a minor improvement in ""neutrality"" tells you that humans want to believe in absolutes - absolute neutrality, absolute zero (in Kelvin!) absolute ""right"" or ""wrong"" positions, etc., but the reality is that nothing in this hobby is absolute no matter how scientific you get, because there's always some grey mixed in the black (or white).

I think that there is value to having a neutral set up. Most folks who worship neutral gear could do O2+ODAC+HD600 and be pretty much at their endgame, without compromising hugely on their principles.  But then there's always that urge to mess around with the status quo - it's a human fault. And it's also a human phenomenon that most folks find that colored sound can be equally (if not more) pleasing. That's the very crux of Sean Olive's research - that most folks *don't* want to listen to neutral sound. And that's the reason why the Vmodas and the Grados and (God help us) the Beats in the industry do so well - because they scratch the itch of folks whose brains desire a sound profile that *isn't* flat.

Me, I like to shuffle the deck. A lot. Sure, the choice of headphones is most critical, but I also like to shuffle the deck with dacs and amps, mainly because the variations they inject into the sound are just as fascinating as the music itself.

Technics = Panasonic

Panasonic created the Technics brand a long time ago to compete against the (then) hi-fi titans - bands like Nakamichi, Pioneer etc. But over time brands like Nakamichi got flushed down the toilet, so Panasonic phased out the Technics name and rebranded pretty much everything they could as Panasonic.

But Technics never really lost its cult following in Japan, and over the last couple of years Panasonic has reversed its strategy and has reintroduced the Technics brand in a phased way.

The bad news is that all delta sigma DACs sound very similar

The CS4398 isn't really obsolete quite yet. It supports both standalone and I2C/SPI configurations, and can do DSD with its (proprietary) DSD processor.

The Xonar DX is a perfectly good sound card IMO, and my issues with it are more philosophical than anything else.

So what are these issues? Why, I'm glad you asked :-)

First, Asus has sold its soul to surround sound and crappy processing gimmicks. Dolby this, Dolby that, DS3D (TM), VocalFX (TM), MagicVoice (TM), FlexBass (I'm getting tired of typing TM after every so-called ""feature""), VolumeNormalizer (ok one more TM) - there is more jargon associated with the DX than DUIs associated with Lindsay Lohan.

The DX, simply put, is designed for surround gaming, not for folks like me who like to game in 2 ch stereo, like God intended us to game (if He had wanted us to game in surround, He would have made us with 7 ears and twin subs in our buttocks for the bass)

Second, the AV100 (primary sound processor in the DX) is in reality a Cmedia Oxygen HD with a fancy name. And you know how to spell Cmedia? Yep, C-R-A-... oh you get the rest.

Third, the excellent CS4398 is used only for the *front* sound output. The rest of the surround sound channels  have to make do with its step-sibling, the CS4362A. 

And finally, RightMark Audio Analyzer. It comes bundled with the DX. It has some pros (for example, it's free!) but also a bunch of cons. I believe nwavguy wrote a blog post about RMAA in detail (knowing nwavguy, in excruciating detail) in one of his blogs. I'm too lazy to find it and link it, but Sergey Brin and Larry Page could use   your business :-)

But seriously, you shouldn't be hearing crackling.

Obviously M&amp;J is outsourcing the production of their product to an OEM. And since there arent that many headphone OEMs that offer electret products, In2uit is one of the obvious OEM suspects.

So here's what I suspect really happened. Mitchell (or Johnson) had a contact with In2uit, and negotiated the price of a limited production run of headphones branded with the M&amp;J logo. I'd guess In2uit quoted a price of around, oh say $20-30K. Maybe Mitchell (or Johnson) got to sit with the engineers at In2uit and tweak the sound profile a little, or at least as much as the In2uit folks let them. Mitechell (or Johnson) probably also wanted to redesign the shells a little, and In2uit probably told them what it would cost (if I had to guess, I would say the quote was more than what M&amp;J could afford).

So Mitchell (or Johnson) decided to go with a slightly-tweaked In2uit as their kickstarter product.

I may be off base here, but I suspect I'm not. And it I am, I'm sure Mitchell (or Johnson) will correct me :-)

My guess is that if you get a 650, your next upgrade will be a closed pair to replace the M50s. But if you get the 598, you will probably end up upgrading both the M50 and the 598.",2016-01-07 17:27:05+00:00,cypikd8,4.0,t1_cypig1u,169.0,headphones

Although as a caveat I should say, if you are unfamiliar with electronics, don't go around opening up OTL tube amps because they generate dangerous, perhaps lethal voltages!

Regarding power tubes, you will find a lot of recommendations for electroharmonix 6H-30pi tubes, and if you can find NOS EH tubes, they are indeed great. But electroharmonix 6H-30pis may also be Nue Sensor reissues, in which case they are, well, crap.

IMO you cannot go wrong with NOS  Novosibirsk Gold Grid 6N6P-i  tubes. Those marked ""OTK"" (soviet plant quality stamp) will probably last longer than those without the stamp. They are cheap, too.

Also, when you swap out the power tubes also try to get your hands on a pair of NOS Mullard M8100s. Again, avoid the reissues - if the Mullard tuibes say ""Made in Russia"" they are reissues and crap.

gain is the ability of an amplifier to increase the energy it outputs (compared to the input) by adding energy from its own power circuit.  In ELI5 terms, increasing gain increases the volume of sound output.

The higher the impedance of a pair of headphones, the more energy it needs for its drivers to produce sound at comfortable listening levels. Often a high impedance headphones doesn't get loud enough at low gain levels, which is where a ""high gain"" setting comes in handy.

First, thank your dad. This is an astonishingly fantastic present that will set you up as an audiophile for life. It is even better than a stripper and a mariachi band.

Second, you need to do your research. You have until tomorrow to read reviews, watch impressions, heck your dad might even be able to hook you up with Axell Grell.

Third, when you get it, plug it into your computer and listen to some of your favorite music. Contrary to what some folks will tell you, it will work just fine off a computer motherboard. In fact, I know someone who plus their HD800 into their phone all the time. And you know what? It works.

Once you get used to how the HD800 sounds, then IMO you have a decision to make.

Most likely you are going to love it. And to get the most out of it, you need an amp. Now the choice of which amp you will get depends most on how much $$$  you have, or more importantly can you get your dad to spring for an endgame amp too. There are a lot of viable choices that range from a hundred bucks to thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars. Before you throw your money into that pit, take your time and do your research.

There is also a small possibility that you are going to hate the HD800. Not everyone likes caviar the first time they try it. If that's the case,  have your dad return it and get something more to your tastes. Let someone else enjoy that HD800.",2016-01-07 08:20:46+00:00,cyp4x77,1.0,t3_3zucgn,5364.0,headphones

3206,"The mini i and DC1 are very comparable, and have pretty much the same features. The only major advantage of the mini I that I can think of is that I can program my logitech harmony remote to  work with the mini i

I ended up buying the mini i mainly because of /u/jensway and his excellent post about the matrix on headfi a while back (his username there is White Lotus, I'm on my phone and am too lazy to link). It did end up going back to China to fix a busted USB chip, but I bought mine from the matrix US distributor and Arthur's customer service was excellent.

The DC1 has an excellent DAC section, but the headphone amp implementation is a little clunky, and the dual 1/8 inch headphone jacks are more of a gimmick than useful, IMO

Both have pretty much the same inputs, and both can be used as pres.

Here, IMO, are the main differences. The DC1 manages 1W output at 42 ohms, 170 mw at 300 ohms and 90 mw at 600 ohms from a digital input. The numbers are a little different if you use analog in, but not too far off. The mini i does something like 750mw at 32 ohms, 140mw at 300ohms and 80mw at 600ohms. I'm going from memory and the numbers may be off a little, but I know I am close. 

the mini i also has a higher output impedance of 12 ohms, emotiva does not advertise the DC1 output impedance numbers but I remember reading that it is negligible.

From a price performance perspective $285 is a great price for the mini i, I think I paid something like $300 for mine and I thought it was a great deal.

Bottom line: both are great products. It really depends on how much $ you have to spare.

tl;dr: damn you /u/jensway :-)

edit: if anyone knows where the DC1 output impedance is specified, could you please link it? It will be good to know

3222,"there's a difference between ""electret"" drivers and ""electrostatic"" drivers. 

What's the difference, you might ask? Good question. There are 2 important differences, IMO

First, an electret driver uses a membrane with a charge that is permanent. Unlike a typical estat driver that requires the charge to be applied every time it fires up.

Second, they are inexpensive. Electret drivers have been around for a *long* time. They were most commonly seen in low-end headphones in the 70s, because they were cheap to make - in fact, cheaper than the audiophile dynamic drivers of the time. They were also relatively rugged (early paper cone headphone drivers might break if you *sneezed* when you had them on) and technically easy to manufacture compared to traditional electrostatic drivers.

So why did they fall out of favor? Well, because they sounded like crap. Typically the high end was blurry and the low end was non-existent, so they stopped using them for audiophile applications because they are no more audiophile in design than a Yugo is designed for Le Mans.

So I'm not surprised to see a cheap electret headphone design show up, it was only a question of time. And adding a dynamic driver to handle the bass is a good idea, as long as you get the crossover right. 

Just don't expect them to sound like Stax.",2016-01-06 23:42:52+00:00,cyooq8y,1.0,t3_3zs8n8,4454.0,headphones

although, to be fair, two counter-arguments: first, some folks hold the volume slider of their OS just shy of 100%, the typical reason is that it reduces the likelihood of clipping (which may or may not be true, depending on your motherboard and/or DAC).

And second, while bit depth reduction due to system volume reduction was a real concern in the old 16 bit pre-XP windows days, today's windows automatically upsamples everything internally to 32 bit depth, so a reduction in signal quality due to ratcheting down system volume isn't likely to truly affect SQ in an audible way,.

3286,"the DAC component clearly outclasses the Modi2 or the ODAC - it is well built and fully featured.  The amp component, not so much. From a sound profile perspective, if the O2 is center-neutral and Magni2 is bright-off-center, then the D300 is a little on the other side - I would say ""dark-off-center"" but that's not entirely an accurate description. But it gives you an idea.

IMO yes you would need to eventually go up on the amp.

If you are curious about AL32 processing (which is a Denon thing), or you are looking for a beefy DAC with 2 optical inputs and line out (they are hard to come buy, and typically cost much more than $200!) then the DA300 is exactly what you say - a fun/horizontal upgrade.

If you have both a PS4 and a Xbone and want to use SPDIF out for both into a convenient single unit, then you won't find anything cheaper than the D300 at this price unless you want to DIY an optical splitter/joiner solution. 

If you are tired of the usual SS amp sound profiles and want something that sounds just a little different (not night and day different, by ""little"" different I mean exactly that), a profile that is favorable for jazz or acoustic or opera (with an emphasis on vocals) and also happens to works well for gaming or watching movies, then the D300 is a fun upgrade.

3291,"This is a crazy good price for the DA300. 

This is a slick DAC/amp combo, with only a few (but probably significant) flaws. 

But first, the construction: it is top notch. Even though the enclosure is mostly plastic, the unit is hefty and weighs more than you think it would. And that ""Denon"" you see is actually an OLED display, which adjusts to whether you have the unit lying flat or standing up. 

Second, it has all the inputs you need (USB, 2 optical - so you can plug in both your PS4 and Xbox One - and coax). It also has RCA line out so you can connect your powered speakers.

At its core is a PCM1795 DAC chip, which means upto 32/192 and DSD compatibility. 

It isn't a neutral amp, though. Although it has tons of details (thanks to its AL32 processing, more about that below), it has what I would describe as a smooth and overall ""inverse-U"" profile, with modestly prominent mids. Denon tuned it for its own headphones, which is fine by me because I usually pair mine with a AHD600 or Q701, because the DA300 serves as my primary gaming DAC (PS4 optical in, Xbone optical in, coax in from computer, RCA out to powered monitors).

Some unique features: the OLED display is very cool. You can place the DA300 either standing up (it comes with its own base plate for vertically mounting it) or traditionally on its side horizontally. The OLED screen automatically figures out the orientation and adjusts. When I first unboxed it, I spent an inordinate amount of time putting it on its side, then upright, then on its side, then upright....you get the idea :-)

 Interestingly, the DA300 has separate output stages for the headphone amp and the line out circuits, and the DAC stage is particularly well designed, IMO. 

It also has a ton of isolator chips (I counted nine of them when I cracked it open) which means zero USB noise and floor noise, even with my most finicky diva headphones.

So what are the flaws? First, *everything* gets up sampled by the DA300, and while this is in theory supposed to improve SQ, it really doesn't, and is more of a gimmick. Second, using AL32 processing to achieve upconversion is another gimmick, IMO, and changes the sound profile so that it's this ""inverse-U"" shape. This is unique and interesting but not really a good match with headphones like the HD650, IMO, because it kills the high end.

And my biggest gripe with the DA300 is that despite all the bells and whistles, the headphone amp lacks muscle, putting out only 50mW at 32 ohms. Which means it struggles to power high impedance headphones, which is surprising because it has 15V DC in, and isn't just USB powered.

Having said this, this deal IMO is spectacular, and an absolute steal. I paid $399 for mine, and I don't regret buying it at that price.

3327,"&gt;I've read that the SZ1000 sounds better for all around listening

The main reason I bought the SZ2K was because of its innovative design. It has three unique features, IMO. 

First, the Kelton speaker design for the bass driver is super cool, and the way the JVC engineers built the [dual bass reflex chamber](http://cdn.jvc.eu/szfxz/sz/img/more/db_ref.gif) is IMO  diabolically clever. And lets not forget those ducts that ""filter"" the bass. Fiendishly innovative, for headphones.

Second, carbon nanotubes. Need I say more?

And third, the JVC engineers got around the whole low-frequency vibration issue (undesirable!) by enclosing the diaphgram assembly in a [thick brass cylinder](http://cdn.jvc.eu/szfxz/sz/img/features_04.png) which acts as a rigid dampener.

Except then they castrated the SZ2K to produce the SZ1K - the 1K has a plastic dampening cylinder, smaller ducts, and the 30mm driver takes over later in the FR so there's a perceptible dip and notch in the 300-1000 Hz range (is that what folks think makes it sound better? Because it doesn't).

Here in the US, I'm paying a premium for both the 1K and the 2K because JVC isn't really interested in marketing them stateside. I got the SZ2K because I figured, heck I might as well get me the model with the feature what attracted me to the SZ series in the first place - the brass cylinder.

but seriously, that's really not acceptable for a high-end pair of headphones.  Unlike some other squeaky headphones, there's no obvious place to lubricate the headstrap in the EL8 without disassembly. Have you tried the usual simple solutions - run the strap through its range of motion a few (say 50) times, or left the headphones stretched over a pillow overnight?

I would contact Audeze and see if they swap your EL8. IMO you'll never be able to get past the squeak without feeling frustrated.

FWIW, the pair of EL8 (closed) I auditioned had a squeaky headband too. I didn't think much of it at the time though, because I used up all my angst on the connector :-)

They are bass monsters and worthy successors to the awesome XB500/700/1000

When it comes to bass I think of the SZ2K as a muscle car, say a 1969 Dodge Charger. It's great at delivering raw powerful bass, and as long as you drive it in a straight line (say with dubstep or DnB) it delivers unhesitatingly and without question, like Domino's on a rainy night.

But then you try to throw it around some curves at Nürburgring, with say some  folk or classical or jazz, and it fails miserably, just like the 1969 Dodge Charger can't say ""jawohl"" if you tell it to execute a sharp right turn.

Don't get me wrong, I love the SZ2K. I just don't use it for anything anymore other than dubstep/DnB and some hip hop anymore, because the bass doesnt just overwhelm the rest of the frequency spectrum, after a while it gets so far up your butt it can see your tonsils.",2016-01-04 00:03:08+00:00,cykxda8,1.0,t3_3zc0z6,2898.0,headphones

On the one hand, $290 is an unbelievable price for the Pro900, it's an absolute *steal*.

On the other hand, it's a Pro900.

The Pro900 is one of the most polarizing headphones I have ever heard, and I'm not really a fan of its sound profile, but there are those who swear by it.  

The primary reason the Pro900 sounds so different than everything else out there is because it uses a design principle that Ultrasone's founder Florian Konig called ""s-logic"". It is a unique approach to headphone design, and Konig claims not only that the technology offers better soundstage and imaging, but also that it helps to protect your hearing.

Folks have argued about the theory behind s-logic for a while. Rather than explain it all over again, I will point you to what i wrote about it [here](http://pa3p.blogspot.com/search/label/Ultrasone%20Pro%20900), where I also link to Konig's AES paper so you can judge for yourselves.

tl;dr: even though this deal's pricing is awesome, the Pro900 may be the one headphone you don't want to buy blindly, unless you know what you are getting into. If you can audition one locally where you live, and you find that you like the ultrasone house sound, this is a great deal from a price-performance perspective.",2016-01-02 23:09:24+00:00,cyjr5eq,1.0,t3_3z76kg,390.0,headphones
3379,"Most of you know that I love LD amps, even though yes they have cheap components and yes they are made in China and yes they run AC to the tubes which reduces their lifespan etc.

Why? Because from a price performance perspective they are absolutely worth the money. The only caveat is that if you buy them from David Zhezhe (Little Dot seller) and if you get a lemon you have to ship them back to China which costs $$$ and kills any price performance advantage you may have had the first place. This is why I like the Massdrop deals on cheap Chinese amps, if something goes wrong you deal with mass drop in the US and not the manufacturer in Asia. It's one of the few examples of the grey market working to your advantage.

I wrote about the differences between the Mk3 and the Mk4SE, and also discussed who should get this amp (and who should not) [here](http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2015/01/some-thoughts-about-little-dot-mk-iv-se.html)",2015-12-29 19:59:40+00:00,cyfagb9,1.0,t3_3yowjv,232.0,headphones

Plus damping factor was popularized by nwavguy, or, as Jude calls him, ""He Who Cannot Be Named"".

Simply put, the rule is: ""divide the headphone impedance by 8 to get the maximum output impedance without potential audible degradation.""

again, impedance matching is only important for headphones with dynamic drivers, not planars. 

Rather than me trying to explain it, why don't I just point you [to the Master](http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/02/headphone-amp-impedance.html).

2. If there isn't a restocking fee, IMO you need to have a clear idea whether you want to keep them or not by the time the UPS dude walks up to your front porch. The advantage of going through the process now is that if you decide you don't want to keep them just decline to accept the package.

3. If there is a restocking fee whether you open the box up or not, IMO open them up and listen to them exclusively for a while. If you like what you hear, no loss, no foul, all is well in the world. And if you dislike them, take the hit and get rid of them, because if you hate them they will never get much listening time compared to the HD800

same here. It seems you have to apply an ungodly amount of dynamat for audible differences to become prominent. For a closed or almost-closed headphone mod like the T50RP it will indubitably make a difference, but for an open pair of headphones like the HD650 I am hard pressed to logically explain how sticking a couple of tiny strips of dynamat on the baffle struts will alter the sound in a significantly meaningful way.

On the Lyr 2 you can defeat the noise floor a little by choosing low gain but it's an irritant reminder with lower impedance headphones when music isn't playing. The funny thing is, you have less noise with ***tubes***. 

Which is something that should drive every objectivist who listens to Lyr + LISST crazy.",2015-12-26 19:02:23+00:00,cybzp6i,4.0,t1_cybzjw5,309.0,headphones

3462,"IMO save your money, LISST is a gimmick. ~~Lye~~ Lyr isn't really dependent on the tubes anyway for its power output, so all LISST does is swaps the tubes with a couple of MOSFETs. So it changes the sound profile a little. In exchange you get a ton of floor noise (and you know how high it can go with the Lyr's output stage!) and bragging rights. That's about it.

I'm not sure what you mean by  ""best of both worlds"". Lye already has one ~~for~~ foot in both worlds. All you are doing is taking the foot in Tube world out of Tubeworld and putting it in SSWorld. 

IMO  if you want to roll tubes, roll *tubes*, not some weird-ass MOSFET imposter.

really? You think they are lying that they are out of stock? Hoping that somehow this will make angry consumers go away? Not trying to be rude, but that's, well, naive.

One of the fundamental tenets of customer service is that if you can't make the unhappy customer happy, they aren't going to disappear, they are going to get *twice as unhappy*.

Also, keep in mind that products like headphones are typically made in production batches, not continuously 24/7/365 like cars. And every pair of headphones sitting in your warehouse after production is a loss that is eating up your profits, so the prime objective is to try and ship them to your distributors ASAP after production.  If Gibson has halfway competent folks managing their inventory and sales, they would probably try to move as much product as quickly as they can to distributors and large retailers like Amazon, and keep their own stocks to a minimum.

So now add to this equation the stampede of angry customers at their doorstep asking for exchanges,  and the fact that they have been replacing X2s sold not by them but by Amazon.

OP what you are doing in essence is comparing two headphones solely on the basis of the fact that their frequency response  is clockwise-tilted across the entire audible range, and then taking that single fact out of context to make an assumption that  isn't necessarily correlational. 

By that measure both the X2 and the M50 should remind you of the LCD3, because LCD3s also have a clockwise-tilted profile where output diminishes with increasing frequency.

IMO outside that dark tilt to the frequency profile, the M50 and the X2 sound nothing like each other. And neither of them sound like the LCD3.

3559,"Hmm good questions. Rather than my usual rambling style, I will try to answer in specifics.

The thx00 does not feel like a $1300 pair of headphones, thats for sure. Or even a $1000 pair of headphones, which is the MSRP quoted by Amazon.

The x00 also skews dark imo rather than retain a truly V shaped balance. In that sense its not a D2K clone.

Personally, i think that 600 treble has more air, but its a close call. And X00 soundstage is narrower than that of the TH600, but I wonder how much of that is attributable solely to pad design.

Bottom line: I think folks with a TH600 should stay put and not step down to the X00s, unless they are *really* bothered by the 600 treble.  And conversely folks looking to recapture a sense of old-school Denon sound by getting a Fostex, but without the $ or the will to jump directly into TH900s should get the X00, not the TH600. 

 Does that make sense? I think my rationale right but my language is clumsy, I will have to work some more on the words.

3563,"&gt; So can a neutral amp have significant bass, more so than a really tubey sounding amp?

no

&gt;Does the tubey amp have more bass

maybe

&gt;Does a neutral tube amp still sound tube like? More than a solid state?

not all SS amps are neutral

Typically when you think ""OTL tube amp"" you think of warm gooey golden euphonic sound. Sorta like Sofia Vergara in a catsuit cuddling up to you and talking in a Colombian accent while increasing the thermostat in the room to 99.9 fahrenheit degrees.

Thats the LD Mk3

But not all OTL tube amps are warm and gooey. Some are clinical and relatively neutral, like the Vally 2. Some audiophiles who worship at the altar of neutral sound think that relatively transparent tube amps are exciting, while others think that they make the sound emotionless, like Keanu Reeves' acting.

Me? I like Colombian women. Even if they aren't Miss Universe. If you want the typical euphonic distortion associated with tube amps, IMO get a colored tube amp like the LD3. And if you want transparency, get a solid state amp because they are cheaper, more efficient, less finicky, last longer, and you don't need to replace components every few thousand hours. If you want to stay neutral (like Switzerland!) but *must* have an OTL, get the Vally 2.

3568,"Philips has spun off a bunch of electronics stuff over the years as their core business model has evolved

In the 80s they spun off their photolithography (building the machines that build chips) unit into what became ASML

They then spun off their semiconductor business as NXP

In the early 2010s Philips sold their TV operations, that became TPV Tech

They then decided to sell their audio assets to Funai, but that deal fell through. Eventually they spun off headphones as Woox

Why? Because in the meantime, Philips was heavily diversifying into healthcare, buying up companies like Respironics (healthcare devices) and VISICU (telemedicine).

Some years ago they got rid of the ""Electronics"" in their name.  Last year they completed the transformation by splitting of their lighting assests (including their auto lighting business, which I believe they sold to a private investment firm consortium.

3569,"wow has it really been that long since I said I would do it?

alas, the formal writeup will have to wait until after the holidays (traveling)

specifically vs TH600 - X00 bass is a little less prominent than the 600, but sub bass extension is equivalent. I think the 600 sub bass is a little cleaner but its a subjective call at best, and I think more because of the enclosed pad volume in the X00 than anything else. X00 bass is just as tight and punchy as the 600. I dont notice any bleeding into the lower mids. In sum, the X00 is a bass delight and a truly worthy successor of the Denon dynasty, IMO.

Where the Xoo wins over the 600 (surprisingly) is the high end. There are two reasons why X00 treble doesnt sound as prominent as the 600, IMO. First, because there is less of it. But second, remember that 3kHz dip in the 600 FR that transitions to a 7000Hz spike? It's that dip-and-spike that makes the 600 high end subjectively sound even more prominently tizzy than the measurements make it out to be. The slightly more forward mids of the X00 and the smoother transition to a more tame high end give the impression that the X00 is audibly less sparkly than the 600. In reality if you strictly focus on the treble frequencies the X00 is only modesly less bright than the 600.

Here's my dilemma: if you can't afford the TH900, and the X00 is the better price-performance deal compared to the 600, then why spring for the 600 under *any* circumstances? If you like the Denon dynasty sound, then the logical sequence of upgrades is the X00 &gt; 900, entirely bypassing the poor 600. 

Also, to specifially answer your question: I have been putting the X00 through sibilant songs to get a sense of where they stand. Purely with respect to sibilance, IMO they have less sibilance than the 600s (and 900s) and more than the Senn HD650 (if you are looking for a range)

And they look gorgeous. The cups on my X00 has all kinds of cross grain and end grain patterns that I absolutely love - they are not as gorgeous as the 900 to be sure, but they are visually more arresting than the 600 or any of the Denon x000s.  I will never be able to take pictures as good as you can, but I wish that for the X00 I could :-)

3591,"people forget that companies change manufacturing processes *all the time*. So when they see minor changes, instead of thinking ""what's the difference?"" the first thing many folks think is ""defect!""!

Pads are glued? Must be a defect! Velour looks different? Must be a defect! Box has different art? Must be a defect!

What folks need to do is, well, chill. There are different ways to explain the anomalies.

For example, take the glued on pads: on one hand, it may just be a process improvement - an iterative design detail that improves the overall sound. Maybe it cuts sub bass rattle or improves resonances by stabilizing the pad against the diaphgram baffle. 

Every company does this to a greater or lesser degree. And not all of them inform the consumer. For example, Senn has changed the material of the diaphgram screens on the HD650 at least once without telling folks they were doing so. And yet every time someone compares an old 650 with a new one, I don't hear them screaming ""defect!""

On the other hand, maybe the pads are glued because someone screwed up the tolerances and they didn't fit snugly on the posts. Rather than reject the batch, someone decided that it would be easier just to glue them down.

Which version is correct? &lt;*Shrug*&gt;, who knows. Instead folks end up going off the wild end and the  stampede to score the deal becomes a stampede to return the goods.

IMO if this helps, either stick with earplugs or go for some 215s. If you still have issues focusing after trying out the earplugs, maybe take the medical route.

3633,"&gt; What's you favorite Grado model?

SR60e. It gives you 99% of the Grado experience at a great price. I can't tell the difference between the 60 and the 80 at all and the 125 sounds close enough to the 60 and the 80 that you would think they were triplets separated at birth. IMO the only reason the 325 sounds different is because of the pads.

And the RSs sound just plain weird and the PS1K is ridiculously overpriced and so the only other Grado worth considering beyond the 60 is the PS500, IMO.

3634,"turning the volume of your music up to completely drown out extraneous noise is always a bad idea, especially if you want to preserve your hearing. 

You may prefer an isolating pair of full-sized earmuffs, or a pair of OSHA-rated earplugs if your only requirement is absolute isolation.  Peltor is a subsidiary of 3M that makes ear protectors for industry, they typically attenuate about 30 dB or more. Foam earplugs you insert in your ear canals have a typical NRR (noise reduction rating) of 30-35 dB.

CIEMs (custom IEMs) can also give you an astonishing amount of isolation, but they are expensive.

And finally, if you have a medical condition that requires external sound isolation, I would suggest that rather than get the opinions of random strangers in the internet, you talk to your doctor who may be able to set you up with a good audiologist who can discuss options such as custom earplugs with you.",2015-12-20 06:08:33+00:00,cy59kfl,3.0,t1_cy59cfs,595.0,headphones

If intermittent loud noises (like people talking, laughing etc) are your primary problem, getting an isolating IEM is probably a better idea than getting a pair of headphones with active nosie cancellation (such as Bose)

But when it comes to the driver material, he declined to specify where they were sourced.

I have a couple of suggestions.

First, why not pick one or two very popular (and therefore most people will know them) songs from the 80s, 90s, 2000s, and recent Top 40 hits. That way almost everyone who participates in your experiment will have some idea of the song structure, rather than have to wade through an esoteric song they are unfamiliar with.

Second, get one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ECCZWWI). It's cheap, but useful, and will allow you to adjust the volume of each listening station (and song) so that the lossy and lossless songs are of equal volume (folks tend to think that the louder of 2 versions of a song is ""better"", so by using a decibel meter you prevent that particular bias)

Third, you may want to pick a *very* lossy version of a song (something like 96k  mp3 (lossy) and have folks compare it with flac. Many people may be able to tell the difference. Now have them compare flac with something like 320k mp3. You may be surprised by the results.

And finally, if you are using M50Xs, it is only fair to pick a good dubstep song that wakes up the listener and slaps them around a bit. You know, something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa42AW__3F0) :-)",2015-12-18 04:20:05+00:00,cy32avk,1.0,t3_3xax7r,1129.0,headphones

In your budget, if you have a Best Buy with magnolia near you, you may want to audition the PSB M4U1. You may want to take your mp3 player with you, because i doubt BB will have vocaloid samples :-)

Another option is the Philips Fidelio X2, if it goes on sale again for $200. It is much less neutral than the M4U1, but has satisfying bass slam and richness to vocals, especially female vocals. It doesn't have the clarity of the M4U1, though.

Also, this recommendation is outside your budget but you may want to check out the Fostex THX00 when then next batch drops on Massdrop. They are awesome headphones for vocaloid, IMO.

To explain it somewhat simplistically, sound reflects off the inside of the cups of closed headphones, but not in the case of open headphones. This sets up different sound wave patterns in closed vs open headphones.

I like the old speaker-loving audiophile definition of soundstage:  it is the level of accuracy with which the headphones convey information about [1] *size*, [2] *shape*, and [3] *spatial characteristics* of the original space where the recording occurred, and the  [4] *placement of*  and [5] *relationship between* the performers in that space. The resonances and reflections set up in closed headphones can 'constrict"" imaging, giving the impression that the soundstage is narrower. The architecture of open headphones allows more spacious imaging.

There are exceptions, though - rarely engineers design closed enclosures that manage reflections and resonances well, and rarely engineers screw up driver design enough to make open headphones sound like they are closed.

But the SQ of Spotify premium via chromecast optical out isn't as good as running optical directly from a PC into my DAC. And I'm not talking subjectively different. It's audibly obvious.

I think I know why. My DAC recognizes PC input as 96k or 192k depending on the setting but Chromecast input is constantly recognized as 48k.   I don't know if its just me, but there's no way I can change the bitrate using the Chromecast app or via my PC.

990 bass extension is probably a tad more potent than the X2, but the X2 is no slouch when it comes to impact or tightness.

the most prominent difference, though, is in the mids. Both instruments and vocals are clearly more natural sounding and less recessed when you listen with the X2 compared to the 990 - this is particularly apparent if you listen to instruments like the cello or vocals by contraltos like Anna Larsson or Hilary Summers.

From a price-performance perspective, right now, for $200, the X2 has to be pretty much at the top of the list - at least temporarily, until the HD650 goes on sale again :-)

There's lots to love about these headphones - impeccable build quality (except for the bleeding pads issue!) insane levels of comfort, and, most importantly, great sound, with tight bass that doesn't lack impact, warmish mids that make vocals (especially female vocals) sound so euphonic, and an overall pleasing presentation that lends itself to extended listening sessions.

The cons? Well, the bleeding pads, for one. And personally, I find the treble a little grainy, but that's certainly not a dealbreaker. Nor is the fact that the X2 lacks the detail that you hear with mid fi Beyers, and even with some comparatively priced AKGs. And these suckers are *heavy*. Not Audeze heavy (Audezes are depleted uranium heavy), but they will definitely answer Sir Isaac Newton's call more readily than, say the HD650s.

Try to isolate the hum to you source vs. your DAC vs. your amp by running them separately - first your amp - if no hum, then amp + DAC, and if no hum, *then* amp + DAC + source.

no, as configured magni 2 only has RCA in and you need to cycle through inputs in the modituber

having said this, you can always split the the magni input, although you will need 2 dacs (one for your PC  and the other with optical for your console

And you can get pretty ingenious and complex when it comes to multiple inputs/outputs

So for example right now I am running one DAC (USB, coax or optical, depending on my mood) from my PC, and the optical out from my PS4 and Xbone get combined into a single signal to a different DAC (since I never use the PS4 and Xbone at the same time, but my ultimate goal in life is to learn to use a controller with my feet so that I can play on both consoles simultaneously, maybe even *against myself*, but I digress) and then the analog output of both DACs get split again to whichever headphone amp is my ""flavor of the week"",  and also to a dedicated headphone amp with variable out which also acts as the volume control for my powered speakers...

3808,"The choice of amp affects the overall presentation to a significantly smaller extent than the choice of headphones.

What I mean by this is this: sure, you can pair a decent headphone with a good amp and hear nuanced differences in comparison to when you pair it with an entry-level amp (or not, if both amps are truly transparent), but if you listen to a good pair of headphones (like the HD800) with an amp - ***any*** amp - and then instead of changing the amp you swap the HD800 with a pair of headphones significantly lower down in the food chain, for example say a HD518, you are going to hear a significant - not nuanced! - difference in sound quality.

So the HD800 + Soloist will sound a tad brighter and offer a little more detail than the HD800 + the CA DMA, but the HD800 out of your MBA will sound much better than the HD518 + Soloist or HD518 + CA DMA.

But folks who are into the hobby deep enough to buy a HD800 are IMO no longer looking for large variations in sound quality, most of them are looking for nuanced improvements because they understand that the law of diminishing returns operates at the rarefied level of high-end audio. 

So IMO most folks with a HD 800 + fancy amp understand that they will be happy powering their 800 off their laptops, but they also understand that they will be happier powering it off their Soloist, and for the small minority of HD800 owners for whom a marginal improvement in SQ is their raison d'etre for being in this hobby in the first place, the Eddie Current will make them very happy indeed.

tl;dr: The primary gear that affects sound quality is the *headphone*, not the *amp*.

PS IMO the reason you like the HD800 + AK100 pairing is because you prefer the slightly warmer tone that the AK100 delivers - it cuts the HD800 high end just enough for the sound to be more euphonic. That's proof that a nuanced difference in sound presentation can be just as powerful as a night-and-day difference.

Fidelio X1 would be #2 on my list. It just makes everything sound *fun*.

Another surprising contender would be the  LCD3. The Prince of Darkness handles genre-jumping surprisingly well, and gets less love than it deserves, mainly because of its price, and because at stage of the game most enthusiasts weigh the *technical* advantages of the HD800 over the *musical* advantages of the LCD3

IMO you have left it too late.

IMO you have 4 options. 

First, using a plastic rated epoxy to glue together the gaps may help. Or more likely, not.

Second, you may want to fashion a metal ring and clamp it tightly around the area of the break. That's what my buddy did with his 555s when they cracked on him, if memory serves me right they lasted for a few months after that. 

Third,  find a broken pair of headphones on ebay or your local goodwill and transplant the drivers as a DIY project. The 555/595 drivers are awesome, IMO, and who knows, you might even find a broken 515/555/595 that makes your project super easy.

At first i thought it was a faulty jack on your Moto X, but if your earbuds sound the same with other sources, then it's not that.

It would be highly unusual (and probably impossible) for your smartphone to fry your earbud drivers, especially *three times* in a row,

My guess is that you are putting stress on the earbud connector or cables either by bending the connector (for example when you are walking with the phone in your pocket and your earbud plugged in) or you are damaging the earbuds when you wind them into a coil or carry them in your pocket.

I suppose that you could make an argument that a larger driver can push more air volume and therefore in theory can deliver more bass (larger excursions for bass) but even that's not necessarily true, For example the Panasonic RP-HTF600-S has 50 mm drivers and the Sony XB500 has 40mm drivers, but when it comes to bass the XB500 beats the Panny into a bloody pulp.",2015-12-11 05:10:39+00:00,cxv1dhn,2.0,t1_cxv0j0z,1682.0,headphones

&gt;how much stock I should be putting into this sort of graph 

chicken or beef stock?

The objectivists on the sub will tell you that graphs are *everything*, and that comparing graphs is the only really objective way of comparing headphones, because ears can deceive you but data never lies. They have a point, because psychoacoustic phenomena are rampant in this hobby.

The subjectivists on the sub will tell you that graphs aren't everything, that tonal nuances and minor but audible variations are triangulated and extrapolated by the brain into qualitative differences and cannot be captured by a graph or a waterfall plot. And they have a point too, because *reliable* differences that are perceptable between headphones with similar graphs suggest that nuanced variations aren't just all psychoacoustic,

At this stage of the conversation, usually the objectivists grab their pitchforks, the subjectivists grab their swords, and the two parties stab each other in mortal combat.

Me? I grab my popcorn and watch the battle.

tl;dr: There's room for both subjective qualitative impressions and objective quantitative measurements in this hobby. Graphs are an important tool of the objectivist trade.

sorry to hear about your experience, OP

logitech appears to be pulling out of the IEM business (I guess its not just you regretting your UE purchase, even logitech may be having buyer's remorse after their UE acquisition)

 I'm not surprised they dont support legacy UE900s any more (it has been a while since they were discontinued) and I'm not surprised that the 900S are out of stock, I expect them to stay that way.

The right thing to do was probably to give you your money back (in business, making the customer go away, preferably happy, is better than having them hound you constantly) but in reality if you bought the UE900s from a 3rd party seller who is not authorized by UE, Logitech is not legally bound to honor their warranty  or be obligated to you in any way.

There are a lot of grey market sellers out there and some of them are even reputable (hello, massdrop!) but if Logitech, or any other manufaturer for that matter started servicing all their grey market warranties, the revenue loss would be untenable.

IMO OP you are the victim of an unfortunate situation - in fact, a perfect storm comprising of a peripherals company that dabbled (IMO unsuccessfully) in the IEM market, a 3rd party unauthorised seller on amazon, and an indifferent customer service representative.

OP most likely you are SOL at this stage of the game, unless someone from Logitech reads this and wants the positive publicity associated with doing a good deed during the holidays (ho ho ho)

Also, after you have layered 2-3 strips of Transpore, consider cutting a piece of Transpore in a circle about 1 cm in diameter and placing over the center of the driver

Do *not* do the naked driver mod before putting transpore on!

Edit: PS it's funny how OP asked a mod question and two mods responded :-)

edit 2: You have 3 options regarding transpore

First, transpore by itself doesnt reduce treble. It acts as a reflector and increases extension (sometimes folks find this fatiguing). So you need something like felt to tame the transpore. You could layer the transpore above or below the felt for different effects. You could use a strip of transpore, or cut it into a square or circle.

Harman = AKG, Infinity etc

higher end JBL speakers are decent (eg Studio 590). Low end JBLs can be crap (eg ES20)

Harman is postioning JBL for the ""lifetyle"" market - their headphones are heavily marketed as a fashion accessory. The Everest Elite 700 is bluetooth (strike one), noise cancelling (strike 2) and has a proprietary sound calibration algorithm (strike 3) that prevent it from being an audiophile contender. You can disable the NC (which is meh) and listen via cable. 

I have heard them briefly, and I wouldn't pay MSRP for them. But then they look cool (especially in white) and I can see how fashionistas would like to have them hang around their necks. Do they sound great? No. Were they the worst headphones I have heard in years? No.

The best part of carrying a phablet around is that you can take notes with the little pen. And you can copy and paste said notes when you are on reddit :-) Here are my listening notes from when I heard the 700s (it was a brief session, in a relatively crowded environement):

Impressions with EQ off, no presets, via cable:  overall dark tone, prominent bass, sub-bass can get intrusive in non-EDM genres, mids particularly vocals are forward but with a hint of artificiality, high end sounds lost in the overall presentation. Features seem more gimmicky than useful. Tru Note calibration is diconcerting rather than transparent. ANC is meh. My JBL app is cumbersome and needs work.

This was a weird week because I spent more time doing Thanksgiving things and chasing down BF deals than listening to music. And yes I was subjected to a good dose of Adele too by well-meaning family members :-)

But some gems from my playlist over the last few days:

If you are a Pink Floyd fan you owe it to yourself to check out this cover of Shine On You Crazy Diamond by [Kendra Morris] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlhRrb-zr7k). It's one hell of a cover.

If you are an EDM fan you owe it to yourself to check out [Bustrexx and Changing Faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9duTOLtDw8). The combination is so liquid it seeps into your pores.

And if you are a dancehall  fan you should check out [Bajah](https://soundcloud.com/wejamaicans/nah-back-down-produced-by-dre). Now Bajah is from Sierra Leone, and he collaborated on this song with US-based Andrew Hershey aka Dre Skull (no, not *that* Dre, this one!). The story of this song is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef2cKNyzOvY). As Bajah says, this tune is a banger, and my favorite song of the week. It will get into your head and drill a hole the size of Sierra Leone.

As always, head to /r/venivade for more bangers. And maybe some mash :-)

""Orthophonic"" was RCA Victor's term when they used an electrical process to cut records rather than the old acoustic horn. They continued to use it until a new term became popular -- ""Stereo"".

RCA orthophonics were typically in a cabinet, and treated as furniture.  From what little I can see, yours looks pretty beat up. 

They are a pain to restore, and you shouldn't try to DIY a restoration unless you know what you are dong, because tube amps are high voltage, and can be dangerous. And I wouldn't try to use it without at least some basic restoration - at the very least, replace the worn out old paper caps, and make sure the motor works before sinking any money into it.

As an audiophile, I'm not a fan of creating an exclusive standard that excludes the competition, which is something which Apple is notorious for doing.

4116,"I grow a little weary of one-sided cartoony characterizations of audiophiles.

But let's face it, people, yes this hobby is about money, or more specifically how much disposable income you have to throw into the bottomless dark pit of audiophilia. So it is no surprise that older folks, who have more disposable income, spend more cash on audio gear. 

And as a consequence over the last half-century a whole cottage industry of high end audiophilia has developed, some genuine, some snake-oil. And all of them want to take the money of whoever will part with it - young or old, white or black, human or alien. But just going by the demographics of the US, yes that means more middle aged white dudes than aliens.

But one reason that younger generations do get turned off by the status quo (and yes, we are slowly becoming extinct as a species) is that somehow a subculture of snobbery has flourished in this hobby - the more money you spend, the more reverential the entire sales industry, and even many enthusiasts become. Equating age with budget is the oldest fallacy in the sales book, but I guess some folks, especially in this hobby, never learn.

Many hi-fi stores perpetuate this paradigm. Don't believe me? Walk into a hi fi store with a friend. The caveat is that one of you has to be white and old and proclaim a budget of $100K, the other has to be young and a minority and proclaim a budget of $500. See who gets treated better. 

Now to be fair, not all hi-fi stores fall into the stereotype. I have been in quite a few hi fi stores where the staff take great pains to answer questions and arrange auditions, even though it's obvious that the customer does not have the ability to buy the stuff being demoed. I love those stores, because it is that kind of attitude that will create the enthusiasts of tomorrow.

But I have also seen instances where folks get the cold shoulder based on stereotyping - for example one of my audiophile friends is a rare breed indeed - she is a woman - and when she shops for gear with her husband, almost invariably the sales person talks to her husband and ignores her, except to talk about how the equipment will blend in with the room's interior decor.

The only way to grow this hobby is to get the young 'uns to follow in our footsteps. And I would argue that as a species we are doing a piss-poor job of it, which is why I find John Darko's article refreshing.

The bottom line: this is a great deal and if yoiu are on the fence, you should jump.

****

****

Q: Should I buy these or the momentum 2?

A: if you want to use them on the go, then momentums are a better idea. If for gaming, 598s

****

Q Should I get the SHP9500 or the 598s?

A: the 598s

****

Q: Ordered. I have now entered the headphone game. Any other stuff I need to complete my experience audiophiles?

A: No. Plug the 598s into whatever source you have now and then decide later if you want an external dac/amp or not. The 598 does benefit modestly with an amp.

****

Q:Ugh I am so tempted by this but I already have an HD600 and just got a Fidelio X2 for giggles this week. I'd be crazy to buy this, right?

A: yup, unless you collect headphones or you want to mod the 598

****

Q: I have spare money, I have the HD650s and ATH-M50s. Should I buy these?

A: Not really. The 650 should keep you plenty satisfied.

****

Q: What's a good Dac for this?

A: It really depends on your budget. Veni's rule of thumb: don'tr spend more on your dac or amp than  you do on your headphones. And that means $95 if you get the 598s today. Unless, of course, you plan to upgrade your headphones soon and want to futureproof your gear.

****

Q: Hmmm, rocking a pair of DT770 80's. Wondering if I should jump on these so I have a pair of good sounding open backs. 

A: IMO the 598s make a nice complementary conmtrast to the 770s without breaking the bank. Especially today.

****

Q: Just recently picked up a pair of HD 558, this enough of an upgrade to bother?

A: No

****

Q: Cheapest acceptable amp I can get for these?

A: Monoprice desktop amp, Fiio E10K, Magni, O2. You know you really don't *need* an amp for these, don't you?

****

Q: You've never failed me before. Would this 598 deal be a good upgrade from the 518s?

A: The differences are more subtle than night-and-day. The 518 is a little bassier, although the bass is somewhat looser. 598 mids are a little richer, to me the 518 mids dip enough at 1000-3000 Hz for me to call it ""V"" shaped. A shallow V, but V nonetheless :-)
And if you hear percussive high end like hi-hats or tympani, the 518 sounds (at least to me) a little more recessed than the 598.
Also, IMO the 598 is a hair more comfortable for extended sessions than the 518, although that is probably my imagination.
So in sum, if you go into this expecting only modest differences, you will probably appreciate the nuanced improvement of the 598, but if you are expecting night and day, it's not going to work out for you.

****

Q: Will these be a big improvement over the ATH-AD700?

A: If you want a more colored sound, then yes. TBH if you are a huge fan of AD700 sound, you're probably not going to be happy with ther dark profile of the 598

****

Q: I currently have SOL Republic Headphones. 
Am I going to be blown away by the quality of the HD 598's? 

A: ""Blown away"" really depends on the amount of expolosives you use. But I can confidently say, yes you will hear an audible difference.

****

Q: I ordered the AKG K7xx from Massdrop. Should I get this instead and cancel the K7xx order?

A: This is a tricky one. Overall the K7xx is probably a superior pair of headphones from a purely SQ perspective. But the 598 is IMO more euphonic. It really boils down to a question of individual preference. If you look at it from a price-performance perspective, at $95 the 598 wins.

****

Q:  is it 100% certain that the price on amazon.com will the same for the whole day

A: this deal is probably going to sell out sooner rather than later, unless amazon has an entire warehouse filled with SEs

****

Q: How much sound 'leak' would these produce? As the main environment I'd be buying them for would be a quiet office.

A: they do leak some. At normal listening levels someone in the next cubicle would barely be able to make any details out, but if you crank up the volume in a quiet office, sound will carry.

****

Q: I'm split between these and a pair of Bose soundtrue over-ear

A: Don't get the Bose. Instead get the 598. I have heard both, and please, trust me on this.

****

Q: What is the difference between these and the regular 598?

A: color

****

Q: I will mostly use them to play CS GO, which direction sounds are very important, will I need to get an amp?

A: positional cues and direction depend on soundstage, whbich does not really change much with an amp

****

Q: hmmm would you guys hold out for HD600 to go on sale or just get this one?

A: If you know that the 600 will be on sale, then I would hold out for it. If you are just guess that the 600 will be on sale, well then a bird in the hand is worth a 600 in the bush

****

Q: Regardless of the price difference, does anyone have any thoughts on the 598 vs the AD900x?...I have a pair of grado sr80e's

A: If you like grado sound, you are probably going to prefer the 900x to the 598

****

Q: How might these be for gaming?

A: They are great for gaming.

****

Q: So my only pair of headphones are Fostex TH-600's. Would the 598's be a good complement to these?

A: I would probably go with the HD650, TBH. But this is an acceptable budget compromise

****

Q:I also want to get a turntable soon, should I do that first or expand my headphone collection? 

A: Get the vinyl. Neil (Pono) Young will love you for it.

****

Q: Are these an upgrade from my Fidelio L1s?

A: IMO yes

****

Q: Anyone on how these compare to my Grado SR 80?

A: They have a ***very*** different sound profile. I could go on and on, but to save time I will just say that the highs are significantly recessed compared to the SR80.

****

Q: Are these good for portable use?

A: No


****

Q: Was going to save and buy the hd 650s, is this a good enough deal that I should buy these?

A: IMO continue to save for the 650s

And if you hear percussive high end like hi-hats or tympani, the 518 sounds (at least to me) a little more recessed than the 598.

Also, IMO the 598 is a hair more comfortable for extended sessions than the 518, although that is probably my imagination.

Unfortunately many of my peers forget that being an ""audiophile"" is all about the music, and instead of listening to the songs, they spend all their time listening to their equipment. 

I've always said that you don't have to be rich or throw vast amounts of money at gear to be a true audiophile. Plus old-school audiophiles are a dying species. The only personal audio forum online that I know of which skews towards young people is this one. And the younger you are, typically the less disposable income you have to spend.

when you start thinking about quarter cask and above, laphroaig becomes more mid and hi-fi than entry level.

sure, but there are two reasons I use headphones like the Q701 when I game rather than, say [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KtC6BzBHL._SY300_.jpg)

At one time, game audio used to be, well, crap. But now-a-days, not only do many games have high-quality realistic sound effects, they also have awesome soundtracks. For example, [this is a *video game OST*?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyG6YMLEWus) It would be just as awesome as a movie soundtrack or even as a standalone album.

""Audiophile"" headphones allow you to enjoy the game more than, say, the pair you ""borrowed"" from Delta the last time you flew with them.

I read a lot about how audiophile headphones can improve your performance in FPS games because they deliver positional cues better. To some extent this is true. It helps to localize footsteps better because then you know where your buddy is coming from, and you can anticipate his attack and *blow his head off* instead of dying.

But just like audiophilia, the improvements are modest and not night-and-day. If you are a crappy gamer, a good pair of headphones isn't going to transform you into some kind of MLG demigod. All a headphone can do is give you a very modest advantage. Only you know if you are the kind of competitive gamer who needs that small percentage boost to excel in your chosen sport.",2015-11-25 19:27:50+00:00,cxcwjib,3.0,t1_cxcvagc,1886.0,headphones

There are so many. In this post, I shall focus on a particularly juicy gem.

When the Schiit Vali came out. It wasn't just the usual hype for a new product, it was *astronomical*. Not surprisingly, Headfi went nuts, but surprisingly, so did other sites. And people who you don't expect to say silly things went ahead and said silly things. For example, Purrin said: ""I would seriously buy an Abyss headphone, hook it up to the Vali, and call it a day. That's how good it is.""

Of course, no-one at the time wanted to believe what the Vali was: a bottom-of-the-barrel hybrid amp with microphonics that drove folks crazy. The only thing really impressive about the Vali is it's noise floor.

Because people think ""I want to believe"".

4228,"Loudness isn't everything.

If amps were purely transparent, then it doesn't really matter what amp you pick, because they would all be equally, well, transparent.

You'll hear a lot about impedance matching, but that doesn't really apply to planar headphones.

Eventually, you get amps for one of four reasons. Well, if you exclude actual amplifcation (as in ""make things louder""), three reasons.

First, amps can improve bass to some extent iof you match impedances appropriately. Again, this isn't applicable for orthodynamics, but with the right amp / headphone pairing, you can notice an audible tightening ofd the bass compared to a poor impedance match. It's not night and day, but it's there.

Second, some amp designs are more suitable for specific types of headphones. For example, high current output amps may be more efficient with certain loads, and that affects the output.

Third, and probably most importantly, headphones can add desired sonic qualities to the signal by the way they color the sound. So a Soloist may add brightness to your LCD2 (there's a reason some call it the ""prince of Darkness"") but a Soloist + Beyer T1 may be unbearably bright for some. Similarly a tube amp may add pleasing distortion that creates a euphonic effect. 

In sum, not everyone needs an amp. But then not everyone needs an LCD2 either, so this hobby is all about first world choices and disposable incomes.

Their business model is clever, though. MD negotiates discounted prices for products, probably by assuming the warranty themselves (if something goes wrong with the product you bought from mass drop, you typically contact them not the manufacturer). This is great for the manufacturer because they don't have to deal with the hassle of servicing the product if it is defective. Then MD saves a little more money by negotiating a bulk shipping price from the seller - again the seller is happy because they don't have to send out individual shipments, and instead can dump a bunch of inventory as a single consignment.

4273,"wow 3 interesting products up all at once. I haven't been this stoked about a Massdrop drop for quite a while.

First, the [Violectric V181](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/violectric-hpa-v181-balanced-headphone-amplifier), the next gen nephew of the esteemed V200. Three outputs - two regular headphone jacks and a balanced 4 pin out, ~~a modestly warm profile~~, 4 (count 'em, four) BUF634 opamps in the signal path in a stereo push-pull configuration, whopping 2700 mW power output at 100 ohms (680 mW at 600 ohms), a low output impedance of 0.2 ohms, and a modestly warm sound profile. Plus you have the option of upgrading an add-in digital input card down the line, if you so desire. It could be an endgame choice for some.

Next, the [V800 DAC] (https://www.massdrop.com/buy/violectric-audio-dac-v800). This has all the bells and whistles you could want, with a multitude of inputs (USB? Check. Optical? Check. Coax SPDIF? Check. AES/EBU? Check. Plus it has a coax digital out, and both unbalanced and balanced digital outputs (handy if you plan to pair it with the V181). 

At its heart it has a Tenor TE0722L USB chip, a  PCM1792 DAC chip, and a fancy SRC4392 chip to resample input into some astronomically high number. It sounds like any other sigma delta DAC, though.

And finally, my favorite of the three, the Lake People 109A. Lake People = Violectric (they are based in Konstanz, Germany, which I guess makes them, well, Lake Konstanz people), and this version of the 109 has fancy gold lettering on the front to commemorate something meaningful to Freid Reim (probably his happiness at taking your money for many decades, and your happiness at parting with it).

But it really is a lovely little amp. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of its Violectric cousins, but it is impeccably designed, with [gorgeous internals](http://www.lake-people.de/isotope/g/g109-a-inside-3.jpg) with some great specs - 2300 mW output at 50 ohms, a respectable 590 mW at 600 ohms, but the 60V internal operating voltage makes it drive high impedance headphones with ease, even without having to resort to gain switch gimmickry. Like most Violectric/Lake People designs, it has two headphone output jacks. Both are unbalanced, and if that's not what you want, there is a balanced version (the ""P"").

The 109A has zero floor noise, and is relatively transparent, although with a little graininess in the treble. It isn't as detailed as the V200, but it comes close. And that price ($400!) can't be beat. If you have been lusting after a V200 but can't afford one anymore because their value is rising in the used market like Apple stock, then cast your eye upon the 109A. Unless you want a balanced configuration, this is the price-performance champ in the Lake People/ Violectric stable. And the ""A"" version even more so than the regular ""P"" version, because, well, it's pretty the same thing and it is cheaper.

4316,"The last time a Grado dropped on massdrop (the SR80e) someone claiming to be from Grado wrote an angry post that the deal wasn't authorized by Grado and that some distributor had gone rogue and Grado wouldn't honor any warranty on massdrop sales. It must have been true, because MD deleted the post :-)

So this is probably grey market too, and if you get a lemon (chances are reasonably high, because Grado is not renowned for their QC) you will have to deal with massdrop instead of Grado (and you know that waiting for MD customer support to respond to your email can be similar to the patience of Job)...

But for those of you curious about Grado sound, and not in a position to audition a pair, then this is as cheap as it's going to get to buy a Grado, and since most low/mid end Grados sound pretty much the same, you really don't have to worry about ""upgrading"" your Grado anytime soon if you do decide that you like GRado house sound.

So what is ""Grado sound""? It's bright, energetic, with dominant forward highs that make rock, and possibly folk/bluegrass sound exciting and ""in your face"". The lack of any decent bass, and the virtual absence of sub-bass makes these not the best choice for any genre where the low end is essential to enjoyment - DnB, dubstep, rap fans will find their songs sounding somewhat anemic.

Even though it is ridiculously low-impedance and can be powered by pretty much any source under the sun (including that mp3 player from 1999) its not a great choice for on-the-go listening because it leaks more sound than an old geezer wearing Depends leaks, well, you know.

It is on-ear, so if you have really sensitive ears, it's going to get painful pretty quickly. Plus the stock pads are like sandpaper and tend to crubmble into irritating black dust over time, which does not help. I usually mod my Grados with Senn pads, which helps, plus I like yellow :-). But then that adds to the cost of your purchase.

The Grado design hasn't changed in decades. Sure, they claim to have thoroughly redone their materials and designs when they went from ""i"" to ""e""  but I'm not sure I fully buy that.  Which brings me to what is IMO the biggest con  regarding the SR60e - the cups can rotate a full 360 degrees, which IMO is a design flaw, and stresses the cable to failure over time.

Agree. IMO what you are trying to say (if you will allow me to paraphrase you) is that the SHP9500 cannot render low-end string like double bass or cello in a *natural* way. 

Agree that the treble is too artificial for jazz. Especially the hi hats.

PS The Tristan &amp; Isolde overture is a little distracting and flighty, even when heard at the concert hall.

It means you can leave your headphone plugged in while listening with speakers. It's a shame the AS500 has been discontinued.

My gripe with using headphones with the AS500 is that the remote lets you switch between sources, but not between headphones and speakers, which is a pain because you have to bend down and manually rotate the dial every time you want to switch.

Another issue is the relatively high output impedance, which can be a problem if you are using particularly low-impedance headphones. 

tl;dr: dont get a separate headphone speakers, the AS500 will power most headphones just fine, and with the Cambridge Audio DAC (I assume the DAC Magic Plus?) you will have a warm, smooth sound output.

4352,"Interesting comparison. I'll give it a shot.

Build wise, the clear winner is the A4. Even though the o2/ODAC is solidly built, it still has a vague cottage-industry feel to it. The A4 has impeccable build quality and aesthetics, inside and out.

Purely with respect to ""ability to drive"", the HPA4 powers the 650 to adequately loud levels. And of course, the O2 powers the 650 with ease.

With respect to sound, the differences are very subtle. 02+ODAC combo is perhaps a tad grainier than the A4, while A4 treble is just a little livelier. Both pair well with the 650.

Overall the A4 gives you a few more options (optical in, filters) than the barebones ODAC.  The A4 is more ""futureproof"" with respect to formats (with its ability to support 24/192 and DSD and ability to upgrade firmware) while the O2 is more ""futureproof"" with respect to headphones (02 outputs *6 times* more power at 32 ohms than the A4).

So bottom line: you are giving up output power for features. 

One final note about the A4s ability to upgrade firmware: it has a SD card slot which can't be used for loading up music, but is intended instead to be used to upgrade the firmware, when available. IMO its a gimmick, not a feature, because I have owned my A4 for a while now and haven't seen anything resembling a firmware upgrade yet.

4363,"4 reasons to explain the phenomenon you are observing

1. Some folks equate ""loudness"" with ""quality"". Unless you dB match your sources, a slightly louder source may sound ""better"" - keep in mind that dB is a logarithmic, not  a linear scale.

2. Many smartphones and some laptops sound like crap. So when you listen with an external dac/amp,  the signal is converted from digital to analog and amplified by equipment that is superior to what your phone can do

3. There's a psychoacoustic phenomenon where some folks think that something that is more expensive (or bigger, or gold-plated, or oxygen-free, or whatever) sounds better than something that isn't. Psychoacustic phenomena are not real, but they definitely feel real to the person experiencing it.

4. Some equipment just ""matches"" better with specific headphones. This synergy may be because of something obviously objective, for example optimal output impedance matching (which may explain why you felt bass to be better enhanced using your amp than your phone) but may also be because of subtle, intangible or subjective factors. For example the slightly bright profile of my Burson Soloist pairs awesomely with the LCD3, which has a somewhat darker profile, than, say the T1 (I find the combination of the Soloist and the T1 to be very fatiguing, very quickly).

Or the headphones have bass drops off at too high a frequency, which removes some of the details.

4380,"another day, another $70 deal for the SHP9500

I'm amazed at the hype the SHP9500 is getting. IMO some of the hype, especially on other sites, in the last few months has been ludicrous. I have read how the 9500 compares favorably with the HD600, the T1, and even a pair of speakers.  Like I said, ludicrous.

Bottom line - It is a good pair of headphones, and certainly value for money at $70. If you are on a budget and $70 is your limit, then with only a couple of caveats, you should definitely look at the SHP9500.

But if have the $$$ and you are deciding between a T1 and a 9500, then the decision is a no-brainer. Get the T1.

Even though the hype may lead you to believe otherwise, the 9500 is not exactly perfection - it does have some limitations.

First, it has a bright sound that is forward and crisp, but I found the treble to be somewhat artificial and a tad sibilant. So artificial that it was distracting, but of course, like any bright pair of headphones, you will either be able to live with it, or not. If you are just looking for a pair of bright energetic headphones, then there's always the SR60e to consider instead.

Second, bass is decent, but impact is lacking. If you listen to lots of EDM or favor headphones with a bassy profile, these headphones are not for you.

Third, build quality is good, but you are not going to get materials that you would in a high-end pair of headphones.

tl;dr: for $70, the 9500 is a good choice if you aren't a basshead and can stand the treble.

Now you (and some others) are probably not going to like this, but if I had to pick the most obvious ""bottleneck"" based on the setup you describe, it is obviously ASIO.  

ASIO was great in the days of Win XP and kmixer kernel, but it's now 2015 and Windows audio stack has come a long way from the days when ASIO ran rings around it. TBH win 7 sound stack has great audio quality, and is much better designed than the clunky ASIO implementation. If you don't want system sounds to bother you when you are listening to music, use WASAPI. ASIO is best stored in the same place as your 5 inch floppy disks and 33K modems :-)",2015-11-11 04:52:05+00:00,cww7oz3,1.0,t3_3sapfm,40485.0,headphones
4423,"XB1000 have been discontinued for a while (along with XB500 and XB700) and are now hard to fdind and worth their weight in gold.

For reasons I don't fully understand, Sony stopped making these monster bass cannons  and replaced them with abominations that are not worthy to carry on the ""XB"" name.

There was a time when you could get the XB500 at Best Buy for something like $80. Amazon had the XB700s on clearance for a ridiculously long time.

But the XB1000s were special. They were mostly sold in the domestic Japanese market, and even then weren't that visible outside Akiba and the usual headphone shops. 

I own the 500s and 700s and absolutely love them (with a caveat, read on!), and to my regret I passed on a pair of new 1000s a while ago (*you idiot*!). Of the 3, the 500 probably has the most raw bass, so much so that it is sometimes overwhelmingly dominant.  The 700 has bigger drivers, a more crisp low end, and extended sub-bass. The 1000 bass is overall a tad more subdued than the 700, but it has majestic ""presence"", and the sub-bass extension is unreal, and of a magnitude I have not heard in anything else even close to the price the 1000 was going for when it was in stock.

4466,"&gt;I thought it would at least be a compromise, mid-tier speakers VS mid-tier headphones

It doesn't quite work that way, although you think it should. The advantage of speakers, even low-end ones, is that they give you sound staging and low-end like no comparable headphones can. The advantage of headphones, even low-end ones, is that they give you intimacy and isolation in a way that no ~~headphones~~ speakers can.

Until a certain price point (numbers are all over the place, some say $300, some say $1500, IMO the number is around $600, because that's about what you can get a decent pair of used speakers for - heck, even new MMGs) headphones have an advantage. Bottom-of-the-barrel speakers often sound like crap, sometimes with distortions and colorations that even a deaf person would run away from. But then over the $600-1500 price point, speakers begin to sound so much better than headphones that the only reason IMO you would buy headphones is either because (a) you are into the hobby or (b) you live in an apartment where you can't blast music, or in a dorm, or in a monastery, or in prison, etc.

But when you say ""*Vocals in particular sound basically the same as any other $5 headphone I've bought from a supermarket*"", I begin to think that your X2s might be defective, because for sure I can hear an audible difference between low end throwaway headphones and the X2. In fact, X2 vocals sound better in every way - tonality, timbre, projection, you name the parameter, the X2 is audibly distinct in comparison to, for example, the throwaway pair of headphones you get from an airline.

So the more likely explanation: I think your perception of the X2 is psychoacoustically influenced - you are so used to listening with good speakers that your brain recoils at first contact with the X2. I would give it time, and the X2s will begin to grow on you. 

And then you will go back to your speakers and probably appreciate them even more :-)

I'm not sure I agree with that. The whole objective of capitalism is that everyone tries to make an extra buck or two  for themselves.

&gt;The prices are competitive because there are a lot of people selling the same headphone.

But this I do agree with. Headfi goes through the same cycles as any micro-commodities market, right now there are a lot of new headphone models being released, and so there are more sellers and buyers, so prices are low. In a few months, the cycle may  change, and if there are more folks looking for headphones than those selling them, prices will go up.

But certainly right now is a good time to go headphone hunting on headfi.

****

There once was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. To amuse himself he started to listen to music on his Beats Solo 2. Surprised at the sound quality, he took a great breath and sang out, ""OMG these headphones sound pretty damn good!""

The villagers, who were all headphone enthusiasts and audiophiles, came running up the hill because they thought the shepherd boy had started a new hype thread on head fi. ""Is it the best thing you have heard?"" they asked. ""Is it even better than the HD800S?""

But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found only a Solo 2. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.

""Don't cry 'OMG these headphones sound pretty damn good!', shepherd boy,"" said the villagers, ""when there's no audiophile pair of headphones to be found!"" They went grumbling back down the hill.

Later, the boy sang out again, ""OMG these headphones sound pretty damn good!"". To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the hill again.

When the villagers saw the Beats they sternly said, ""Save your song for when there is really something to sing about! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is NO wolf!""

But the boy just grinned and watched them go grumbling down the hill once more.

Later, the shepherd boy found a REAL pair of audiophile headphones (a HD600, to be precise). He put them on and listened. Then he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, ""OMG these headphones sound pretty damn good!""

But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come.

At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping.

""There really was a HD600 here! Everything sounded so awesome! The holographic soundstage, the airy spacious highs!  I cried out, 'OMG these headphones sound pretty damn good!' Why didn't you come?""

An old man tried to comfort the boy as they walked back to the village.

""Let me tell you something, son,"" he said, putting his arm around the youth, ""Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!""",2015-11-05 06:20:32+00:00,cwp55ln,1.0,t3_3rbele,176039.0,headphones

But the walkman, and then the smartphone changed everything. People predominantly began to buy headphones for use on the go. The problem is, mp3 players and phones don't really power high impedance headphones well. So manufacturers began to sell more models with lower impedances, until you have what you see now - a vast majority of headphones sold today have low impedances.

Headphones intended for the audiophile market  today still have higher impedances, in general, than headphones designed for the street.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a headphone amp that was so quiet you could use it with the most sensitive In Ear Monitors but it also had enough power to drive virtually any full size cans including 600 ohm and current hungry planar models? And, while we’re at it, what if the output impedance was low enough you didn’t have to worry about frequency response or bass damping problems? And, for maximum versatility, what if worked at home on AC power or on-the-go from rechargeable batteries? If you combine all of this with audiophile approved sound quality, switchable gain, great measurements, and a reasonable price, you have something very attractive but also highly elusive unless you’re willing to spend lots of money.

First, its not really a tube amp. All the heavy lifting is done by solid state components inside the amp.

Sometimes adding the tube filter makes the sound euphonic. That's the reason some folks like amps like the Aune T1 (the tube is actually in the DAC circuit pathway, but you get the idea), because there's a richness and warmth to the sound you don't get from an O2 or a Magni.

as far as the sound: none

The 120 or 240V refers to the voltage you get out of your home power sockets - some countries (like the US) have a 110-120V standard, while other countries (like the UK) have a 220-240V standard.

Regarding VSS: the ""virtual"" means that it is emulated, and so you can still manage to use any pair of headphones (that only have two drivers, one on each side) with the program.

But TBH, I prefer to FPS game in plain old stereo and once you get used to the idea, you will probably prefer it too. Try VSS for a while (say a couple of weeks), and then switch over to regular stereo (disable all surround/ enhancements) for a couple of weeks, and decide for yourself.",2015-10-25 18:23:51+00:00,cwcf2wo,1.0,t3_3q5f7i,15005.0,headphones

4691,"this is a very interesting product, but unknown.

In fact noone apart from a few folks (and I assume Will at MD, Michael grace and Jude are three of the ""few) actually knows much about this amp. I had heard about it as a rumor from a friend who is even deeper into the hobby than I am, but the number of folks I know who have heard it are, well, none.

Yes I know Jude loved it, but then he loves everything he writes about, and he describes hearing it with 3 IEMs not many people have (and one that hardly anyone has heard), so his opinion is subjective with an n of exactly 1.

So what do we know that itn't hype? 

Grace design is well known, and has a solid track record, so I don't really expect this product to be a dud (like some of the kickstarters we have seen) or sound like crap.

The AK4490 is a very decent DAC chip, probably a tad armer in tone than the usual Sabre DACs, but not noticeably so. It does DSD, like every other nigh end DAC chip from every DAC manufacturer.

XMOS is a decent choice for a USB controller, and worth the price of admission. The firmware is well developed, and not replete with bugs like you see with some of the low end stuff.

Digital volume control depends on the implementations - sometimes the steps are just right, sometimes each click gets you just a hir louder or softer than you want the sound to be (those of you who have amps with step digital pots know what I am talking about). So how is the gain control on the m9XX? Who knows.

The problem with tapping USB for power is that at times you just can't bring enough game to the table. Adding a second USB power tap helps. It may also increase noise, but that depends on your computer and USB hub (or wall power adapter) and the power implementation of the amp.

But most importantly, how does it sound? I read Jude's post three times, and I'm still damned if I know.

Hopefully it will stay true to Grace house sound, which is balanced and resolving, with tons of detail.

I too am a fan of Grace design, but would I say ""*take my money*"" and hand over credit card information, sight unseen, for a brand new unproven amp design? Well, $500 isn't really a huge amount to pay for a headphone amp, but I would have to say ""*no*"".

[shure makes one] (http://shop-us.shure.com/p/earphone-adapter-kit), as does Etymotic.

what the attenuator does is insert a resistor in the circuit. This will make your sound level lower, and may modestly detract from sound quality, but it may also get rid of noise, and it's a cheap solution

second, the SE215 isn't particularly sensitive, so make sure it's not an issue with your source - try it with an identical source, maybe at an apple store, to see if it's a defect in your apple product, and if it is, heck the genius bar is just a few steps away.

But wait, i forgot, you need an appointment.

I'm not a huge fan of the X3, but I did not hear any floor noise with any of low end IEMs I have tried it with, the only IEM that IMO consistently brings out modest floor noise with the X3 is the SE535.

Realisticially, if you are hypersensitive to floor noise, then the only way to be sure is to audition the gear you plan to buy with the SE215s to be sure you won't be frustrated, because floor noise is all too common with low end audio gear, and even with some that are expensive.

4727,"+1 for OPs appropriate use of ""duplicitous""

+1 for OPs amazing patience - he has been waiting for his T50 since *August* -- damn, that's almost as long as waiting for a Massdrop drop!

lets be realistic, sellers can cancel orders whenever they want to, and often hide behind different SKU#s to bypass sale prices (so when one SKU reads ""out of stock"", another can sell the product at a higher price)

is this a slimy business practice? Yep. Do many retailers do this? Yep.

My guess is that either [1] Adorama understimated the number of units their system would move during their sale in August, and when some bean counter figured out how much their actual profit margin was was, they canceled what they could and restocked under a different SKU, or [2] Adorama ran out of T50 stock and when they got more, it was at a higher wholesale price and so they changed the SKU rather than take a hit by fulfilling orders. 

Either way, customer service is a different department (and often on a different continent) than the sales and inventory guys. In this case, it was 'too little, too late"". There are many ways to make a customer happy without handing over the keys to the bank vault, and obviously this is not one of them.

4739,"&gt; Why do so many people prefer ""flat"" headphones?

I think it boils down to ""what are you trying to achieve?""

If you want to hear the music without the gear ""getting in the way"" - *for example, you want to hear Arne Domnerus' ""Jazz At The Pawnshop"" like you were sitting at table #8 at Jazzpuben Stampen (I'll have the Oppigårds Indian Tribute, tack!)* - then a neutral setup makes sense.

If you want to engage in critical listening, where you can pick up nuances of music - *can you hear Wayne Shorter breathing during the sax solo in Steely Dan's ""Aja"", or the sustain pedal go sha-shu, sha-shu during Yiruma's ""River Flows In You""? I can!* - then a neutral setup makes sense.

If you don't like coloration, or the bass or treble prominence that some headphones bring to the game - *do you know how to make folks heads explode like the aliens in ""Mars Attacks""? Have them listen to Ulrich Schnauss through a Grado!* - then a neutral setup makes sense.

But IMO the main reason is because after you start listening to music seriously, although you may enjoy the warmth of a tube amp or the laid-back sound of colored headphones, is that there is a basic purity and clarity associated with neutral sound that you begin to crave more and more after a while. Think of it like a good Islay single malt, the first time you taste Lagavulin you gasp because it is inky and peaty and medicine-y, but after a while you find yourself preferentially reaching for the stuff and the next thing you know, you are on a ferry from Kennecraig to Port Ellen so that you can sip nectar at the source.

That's what we are doing when we listen to music with a neutral setup, laddie - sipping nectar at the source :-)",2015-10-20 00:14:04+00:00,cw5se6r,1.0,t3_3pekri,10642.0,headphones

IMo they are worth $200, given the alternative options you can get for the price, with 2 caveats

1. Don't expect monster bass. Having said that, the K7xx is perfectly capable of playing EDM in a pleasing manner.

2. The fiddly universal headband mechanism is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. This is *not* the headphone you can throw into your backpack when you get off the bus.

4796,"At its core, audiophilia is a subjective hobby, and there are many more subjective audiophiles (spending a ***lot*** more money) than objectivists out there, so this equation isn't really going to change anytime soon. 

Having said that, there are smart people and audio fundamentalists in both camps. Usually the latter come out and fight each other at regular intervals and will continue to do so until the end of time, like Geser and Zavulon.

Every audio forum has its own flavor.  Head-fi has its own style of doing things thanks to its Supreme Commander of the People's Army of Headfia, and the Pirates have their own p-arrrrgh-sonality thanks to Marv and his obsession with waterfalls. And inner fidelity has its own distinct personality because there can be only one cuddly grandpa  bear in headphone land. 

And so does this sub. It skews more towards mid fi because it's subscribers are mostly younger and have less disposable $ lying around (or if they do, they spend it all on watches and fountain pens and eDC gear and mechanical keyboards and video games).

Second, there is some hype about the Mojo but nothing like when the Hugo came out. Part of the reason is because the Mojo has been shrouded under more secrecy than a Lockheed skunkworks program at Area 51.

Because not many folks are qualified to comment on how the mojo sounds, most folks talking about the mojo online are focusing on how ""cheap"" it is, rather than on how its sounds.

Maybe this is the buzz Chord wants - or then, maybe not. But for all those folks who are saying that the Mojo is a ""game changer"" - guys, why not first figure out *what the game is*, before declaring that it has changed?

Despite the Hugo's meh sound, it's claim to fame (at least IMO) is the custom DAC FPGA chip - you don't see many of those in DAC implementations today. What's the DAC implementation for the Mojo? Who knows.

What does the Mojo sound like? Who knows (except those farming Chord credits at the Shard today). The only objective data I have about the mojo is that it only puts out 35 mw at 600 ohms, so probably not for those high impedance Beyers. 

A few years ago, something like the Mojo would have been Big News indeed (note the strategic use of capitalization). But now, with so many portable mid-fi amp/dac options available for folks to choose between, how successful will the Mojo be? Who knows.

Some onboard add-on sound cards are actually pretty good, and have components you would expect in ""audiophile"" equipment, for example swappable opamps, or Nichicon caps.

However, the real enemy of onboard sound isn't the quality of the equipment, it is EMI noise. Most computers have some, and stretching the internal cable to the headphone jack *across the entire length of the computer* doesn't help. 

And you never know when you are a victim of EMI - you could build a computer with top-of0the-line components and have unbearable noise, and yet some bottom-of-the-barrel PCs are dead silent.

So if EMI noise distracts from your listening experience, then that's the time to seriously consider external amp/dacs. Another reason to go down the external amp/dac tunnel: if you want to climb up the audiophile ladder. Although note, it is hard to climb up a ladder when going down a tunnel :-)

What kickstarter is is a way for folks to crowdsource their ventures. Some of these ventures are good and proper. Some are outright speculation.

Unlike a retail store, there is no guarantee that you will get anything for your money.

Many folks prefer to finance their projects through a website like kicstarter than to do the rounds of the usual financial institutions, VC, etc. because, well, it is so much easier to get a bunch of gullible folks to sign up on kickstarter than to sell their ideas to venture capitalists who actually know something about how to run a business.

if I had $1 for every time I saw a crappy kickstarter campaign that has no business plan, where it is obvious that the folks who are running the campaign are totally clueless, or when folks over-promise and under-achieve, or do a bait-and-switch, well then I would have me a nice chunk of change.

Remember, Kicstarter is where [one dude got $50,000 to make potato salad](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zackdangerbrown/potato-salad). Do you think he would have been funded if he had taken his idea to, say Bank of America or Kleiner Perkins? Hmmm?

tl;dr: if I want to invest money, I prefer the stock market. If I want to buy stuff, I prefer retail. If I see an idea I like and want to support it, with no real expectation of a ROI, I back a kickstarter campaign. I call it ""tech charity"", and so should you.

if an analog signal is passed through unchanged by an amp, the amp is said to be ""transparent"". 

Transparency is a desirable quality for most audiophiles, because it represents the *true reproduction* of sound , i.e. free from any distortions or variations. Some folks use the term ""neutral"" to describe sound that is free from coloration.

While some tube amps are surprisingly neutral, many tube amp aficionados specifically pick tube amps because they distort the sound in a pleasing way. Typically they inject ""warmth"" into the sound - a mellow tone that is pleasing because we instinctively like it when we hear it.

It's not only tube amps that add pleasing distortion to sound, though. Keep in mind that some solid state amps are ""warm"" too, although usually in a way that is different from how tube amps render sound.",2015-10-07 05:41:01+00:00,cvr098d,6.0,t1_cvqzx8b,948.0,headphones

The Premium varies from the Pro primarily because it has [1] more metal bits and [2] less clamp force

The Pro is the better value of the two varieties. Even though it is clad in plastic, it is  robustly built. IMO it looks like a survivor from the cold-war era, I usually pair my 990 Pro with [a theme-appropriate keyboard] (http://i.imgur.com/ldGbHEj.jpg) that coverts my battlestation into a missile silo command center :-)

In general, the 990 has nicely tight bass,  modestly recessed mids, and a bright and detailed high end. The bass isn't overpowering or boomy, though, and works well with genres like EDM. Folks have been arguing about the nature of 990 treble for aeons, if I had to describe it in one word I would call it ""crystalline""

The 600 ohm version sounds a little different than the others, my comments about them (and some comparisons) are [here] (http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-you-need-to-know-about.html)


In sum, the 990 has a V-shaped frequency response curve with an emphasized low end and dominant treble that either sounds like ""fun"" or drives you mad, depending on how sensitive you are to treble. If you know what you are getting into, and the sound profile floats your boat, then the 990s (of any flavor) are impeccable mid-fi choices with lots of longevity when you consider upgrading down the road.

I had really high hopes for them, I guess I fell for all the hype when they first hit the streets, remember when headfi went into a frenzy and they were supposed to be the on-ears to beat all other on-ears?

If you are on the go with them they are tolerable, but if you are in a quiet room engaging in critical listening the dip and spike is obvious, and once you hear it you cannot unhear it afterwards.

I'm not saying they are bad headphones, just that they were a little too off-sounding for me, and a disappointment after everything I had read about them before I actually got my hands on a pair. This was when they were selling for $300, you can get 1350-80s for around $180 now, which makes them a little more palatable.

Second love: HD555. It's what got me into this hobby.

I still love it, even though sound wise it is firmly mid-fi

Best headphones for DnB (because DnB is my favorite genre of music): I still have to find a pair that beats my XB700. The JVC HASZ2000 comes close, but no cigar. 

Favorite gaming headphones: When it comes to comfort + non-fatiguing sound (damn those massive explosions in FPS games can give you a headache with overly-bassy headphones!) if you can suggest something better than the Q701, tell me. At any price.

Folks who suggest that reviewers don't accept freebies at all underestimate how expensive this hobby can be to self-finance, and those reviewers who get offended by suggestions that they disclose all their  financial and business interests underestimate how much lack of transparency damages their credibility.

And in conclusion, there's nothing wrong with a subjective review as long as folks understand that there is good subjectivity and bad subjectivity. Just as there are good objective reviews and bad objective reviews of audio gear out there.

4904,"Another day, another gimmick on Kickstarter...

I have seen a bunch of headphones on kickstarter recently, and they all have the same *modus operandi*

MO #1: they talk about ""cool features"" but never post frequency response curves or other significant objective data, even of their prototypes

MO #2: they don't tell you their business strategy - for example, this particular kickstarter is hoping to raise $37K, which isn't enough to set up their own production chain, so they are obviously OEMing their product from someone else, who probably helped them a little (or a lot) with their design. So what's their business plan for ensuring profits and a decent ROI on their product so that they can stay in business beyond the initial kickstarter offering? We'll never know.

MO #3: They try to build up more hype than generate discussions of substance, and what better place to do this than headfi?

So what do I think about this particular kickstarter?

The concept of converting headphones on the fly between open and closed is interesting. Open and closed headphones have such different acoustic characteristics that trying to close open headphones (like the HD600) or open up closed headphones (like the ATH50) is usually an exercise in futility, where the end product sounds like crap, so if there's finally a viable switchable option, you potentially have the best of both (isolation + soundstage) worlds.

The Vario doesn't really go from full-open to full-closed, though. It's changes sound profiles by opening up (or closing) bass ports. Other headphones do this, e.g. the Beyer COP and the AKG Tiesto K267



Having said this, I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that, but to me the Trinity Vario looks pretty darned good, like a blinged up Sony XB500 (I guess the pads went on a diet)

The build quality of the amperior is excellent, but the hd25II is not too shabby either. So are those metal cups worth an extra $100?

But you bring up an interesting point. The WA3 is a perfectly competent OTL that gets very little love. IMO it's because of its odd price point. At $700 (for the pre-amp out option, so that is is head-to-head with the LD3) there's little to justify choosing it over the LD3 or the Vally 2 (depending on your tastes) from a purely sound perspective. Plus it sits in this grey zone - if I have $700 of discretionary income lying around to spend on gear, I probably have the means to get enough cash together to buy a WA2 and jump straight to endgame instead of jumping there in 2 steps, and if I ***don't*** have the discretionary $ then it is really hard to justify buying a WA3 over a LD3 or a Vally.

We should probably show the WA3 some love and do a thread sometime to highlight it, though. It is indeed a contender :-)

Interestingly, the hard edge is much less obvious with the Crack. I have no idea why, and it's a subjective phenomenon anyway.

4917,"I am a LD3 fanboy. There, I said it.

I have waxed eloquent about this amp quite often in the past, so suffice to say [I think it's great value for money](http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2015/01/my-favorite-sub-1000-setup.html) and that [it's the best amp in the little dot lineup from a price-performance perspective](http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2015/01/some-thoughts-about-little-dot-mk-iv-se.html)

Value, I hear you say, how can this cheap Chinese POS be ""value""? Well, with the right tubes, the LD3 gives the much-more-expensive WA2 a run for its money, and then some. There, I said it. Sorry Jack Woo.

But before I go overboard (wait, wasn't the preceding paragraph enough?) let me take a step back.

OTL tube amps have a few intrinsic cons - they are not necessarily the best sounding with low impedance or sensitive headphones, they command a price premium in the audiophile market, and, probably most importantly, tube rolling can get mighty expensive.

But good OTLs tend to be cheaper that good transformer-coupled tube amps, because, well, good transformers are expensive. But tube amps often offset the cost saving by being more expensive to own in the long term because of the cost of the tubes.

And unlike a transformer coupled tube amp (like, for example the WA7), you can't just throw any headphones you want at 'em because the pairing doesn't always work.

The first OTL headphone amp I fell in love with was the WA2. It has a rich glorious sound, especially with the right tubes, and is built like a rock. The problem is, it also costs as much as a rock - when the rock is a diamond.

So I went on a hunt for the poor man's OTL. I used my WA2 as a benchmark, and compared everything else against it as a gold standard.

Soon I discovered that ""cheap OTL"" is not necessarily code for ""Chinese amp"". There are some decent options - heck, more than decent options - out there, namely the Valhalla (and the excellently redesigned Vally 2) and, of course the Crack. 

The problem with the Crack is that you have to build one, and if you can't (or won't, or don't want to) well then, no Crack for you.

And while the Vally 2 is a great amp, it doesn't ***sound*** like I want my tube amp to sound. I want warm gooey pleasingly distorted sound. Instead the vally 2 is surprisingly neutral. Heck, if I want neutral I'd just buy me an O2 and save all that money, right? Well, maybe. For devotees of neutral sound, the Vally 2 or the Torpedo may be excellent options.

But I want warm, like sticking my head into the caldera at Kīlauea warm.  So the Vally 2 is out.

Then I discovered the darkvoice 336SE. Finally, i thought, a cheap warm OTL. plus I can get one whenever I want because Massdrop drops it, like every day.

But alas, the 336SE is a dud. Crappy QC, plus a bad design that results in a hum that needs a DIY mod to fix (look up Darkvoice Fitz mod), plus stories of it smoking. Heck, if I wanted all that hassle, i could just build me a Crack and set it on fire.

Yes, the LD3 uses cheap components, feeds AC to the tubes (which  shortens their lifespan) and if something goes wrong with it, good luck sending it back to david Zhe Zhe. But it has 3 advantages that make it a price performance champ, at least to me.

First, it is a decent design without badly soldered components and shorting P2P wires like the Darkvoice. 

Second, unlike Woo amps, replacement tubes are relatively cheap - you can buy a pair of NOS Mullard M8100s for $40-50 or even cheaper if you are patient, and a pair of Novosibirsk power tubes for $10-15.

And third, it is gloriously warm. Not an amp for objectivist neutral fans, this. It pairs exquisitely with the HD600/650, and it allows folks to get their feet wet with respect to tubes without breaking the bank or burning down their house.

And that's why the LD3 has the Veni seal of approval.

There I said it :-)

4928,"Do you mean output impedance or output power? Because they are different.

You will note I said ""That MSI is adequate to power OPs SZ2000"", and for a reason.

Amp (or device) output impedance will primarily affect the *sound quality* of the headphones, primarily because lack of electrical damping. So the bass of a poorly impedance-matched pair of headphones sounds bloated or muddy, for example.

Now if the device doesn't have enough output power (milliwatts) then it simply can't get the headphones to high enough decibel levels to ensure comfortable listening.  Since OP isn't having issues with overall loudness, just with bass, it is more than likely that his motherboard is putting out enough *power*.

Having said this, the higher the output impedance of the device, the higher the voltage drop with a low impedance load. So if you have a device with a very high output impedance hooked up to very low impedance headphones, you may drop enough voltage that the sound level won't get high enough. Which is why when I read on the sub recently that someone claimed their low-impedance Grado ""paired well"" with their OTL tube amp (high output impedance), I smiled.

But in this scenario, OP would have an overall inability to crank up the SP to desired levels, not just anemic bass.

4949,"&gt; I heard not a single ounce of bass to it

That's hard to believe. The HASZ2K is one of the few headphones out there that literally spank you with bass. I rank the HASZ2000 up there with my XB500 and 700, and it probably exceeds the XB500 in terms of pure bass output. There is no way on God's green Earth that you should not hear the bass, especially with dubstep.

First, where did you get it from? Is it genuine? JVCs can be hard to find outside Japan, and there are certainly some fake ones floating around on fleabay.

Second, and I know this sounds silly, make sure the connector is plugged in all the way in.

Third, the stock SZ2K pads are a little thin. Make sure they aren't making contact with your ears, or that the circumferential pad seal isn't broken in any way.

If it's not something obvious, my guess is that you have yourself a fake. Or something is wrong with the crossover (the 2K is a 2-speaker design)",2015-09-29 02:34:30+00:00,cvhnxlx,1.0,t3_3mr3k6,18096.0,headphones

Also, the combo of a LD1+ and a Grado is a bad idea, IMO.

You could try switching the gain down to 3.5x but then you have to open it up and move jumpers around (of course, you need to be careful not to mistake the tube rolling jumpers for the gain jumpers, because there a heck of a lot of jumpers under the 1+ hood, and also, of course, don't electrocute yourself!) and *even then* it just has way too much gain for a 32 ohm pair of headphones

4970,"&gt; Handel's Feuerwerkmusik is, in my opinion, a really beautiful and under-appreciated piece

Agree it's beautiful, although wouldn't say ""underappreciated"". 

It has a great history - in the late 1700s, the Hapsburg empire was in turmoil because, well, there wasn't one readily available to sit on the throne. Maria Theresa, daughter of (the dead) Charles VI, was supposed to inherit the title, but a bunch of folks who had agreed to this when Charles was alive chose to disagree after he was dead, because Maria Theresa was a woman. The result: a war, because that's always the easiest solution to solve these kinds of problems. 

To cut a long story short, there was fighting, then yada yada yada, there was a peace treaty signed at Aachen, all was well with the Austrian Succession, and George II, King of England, decided to celebrate by having a party and a fireworks display. He hired Handel to DJ the event, and Handel complied by writing ""Music for the Royal Fireworks"".

Interestingly, one consequence of the drama due to the Hapsburgs and Maria Theresa was [King George's War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George%27s_War), a little military excursion in North America brought on by the events in Europe, which led to, you know, 'Murica as we know it :-)

4976,"&gt;Why are they called headphones and not head speakers?

the term ""headphone"" is from the greek ""phono"" which in English means ""sound""

since they deliver sound to your head (which in Greek means ""kephale"") an entire generation of English speaking Greeks (or Greek speaking English) called them  ""kephalesounds"" but then decided that ""headphones"" was easier to say, especially after a few rounds of ouzo.  

Opa!

^(although it is hard to discern, OK I made that up)

Here's a more credible reason:

The first headphones weren't used for music at all. The first headphones were used to listen to audio signals (amplifiers as we know them hadn't been invented yet); they were mostly used for telegraph and telephone work, and I suspect the term ""headphone"" came from their use.

Plus, audiophile speakers as we know them today weren't popular at the time, so the term ""speakers"" was not commonly used by English speakers when headphones were first used, although most folks were probably familiar with the cutting-edge technology of the time - the telephone.

second: with a budget of $200, IMO you are trapped in a grey zone. Its going to be hard to find a pair of headphone that is clearly an upgrade to your Q701 and K240 for that price. If you want to go down the headphone upgrade route, IMO save some more money and go for something complementary like the HD650, or stick it out till you get the endgame headphone of your choice

And for $200 you don't get to afford a feature-rich future proof dac/amp either.

great review, the only point I would probably contest is that the 545 treble suffers from the same malady as many other AKG midfi models, it sounds a little plasticky, some people refer to it as being a little ""tizzy"". It's not a fatal flaw, but if you hear something like a HD600 or immediately after listening to a K545, you will hear exactly what I mean.

Again, it's not a fatal flaw, but something to keep in mind.

No doubt that the shining feature of midi AKGs, including the 545, is their ability to render detail.

here's my suggestion - to assess ""natural"" (as opposed to ""neutral"") sound, criticially listen to classical.If you have been to enough live classical concerts, you will be able to quickly tell if headphones sound ""natural"" enough by focusing on individual orchestral sections or instruments.

One piece I use to assess this is Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide To The Orchestra"". It great to evaluate instruments because the piece initially features the entire orchestra playing the theme, then specific sections (winds -&gt; brass -&gt; strings, if I remember the sequence correctly) and then specific instruments get to play 13 variations of the theme so you get to run through the entire orchestra and check off details one by one in a relatively short length of time (about 15minutes)

I'm still trying to make up my mind if LISST is the real deal or a gimmick. Sticking either  MOSFETs or tubes into an amp on demand is a cool idea, and in essence the MOSFETs in LISST replicate the JFETs in the original Mjol, so it's not a huge stretch to see them on the Mjol2, but for me the issue of floor noise is still a little off-putting.  

Since there are options at around the same point that offer the promise of *zero* noise floor, the only real attraction of the Mjol 2 apart from its ""now you see my tubes, now you don't"" feature is the fact that it is a great price-performance option for folks with a balanced setup.",2015-09-18 15:53:27+00:00,cv5ylnv,2.0,t1_cv5x90g,2071.0,headphones

5078,"I auditioned the HPA3 and the HPA4, and chose to buy the latter.

The HPA4 is the successor model to the HPA3.

The HPA3 is a handly little USB-powered DAC/amp. It is powered by an Asahi Kasei AK4390 DAc chip, which is a little different than the more common Wolfson or Sabre chips you see on DACs today. 

It sounds a little on the warm side, somewhat warmer than the A4 does, and unlike the A4, the A3 doesn't have a gain switch or filters or the ability to handle DSD or the ability to manage 24bit/192kHz (the A3 goes upto 24/96) or the ability to upgrade the firmware using the SD card slot (the A3 doesn't have one). 

Having said that, the A3 and A4 both share the same achilles heel: because they are USB powered, the headphone amp doesn't put out huge power - both put out a respectable 100 mW at 32 ohms, but both drop to a more anemic neighborhood at higher headphone impedances - in the neighborhood of 20 mW at 300 ohms. 

So if you have a hard-to-power or high impedance headphone, the A3 is going to struggle to power it like a Yugo trying to get to the peak of Mount Fujiyama.

The A3 does have some pluses, though. Apart from the AKM DAC chip (uncommon), it has great build quality, is relatively cheap (as Fostex dac/amps go - if you don't believe me, check out the price on the HPA8!) and the RCA out means you can use it to also power your active speakers. The optical out allows you to daisy chain the A3 in a sequential digital set-up.

I ended up choosing the A4 because [1] it had more features, [2] I already have a bunch of warm-sounding DACs (Wolfson FTW! where ""FTW"" stands for ""For The Warmth"") and thought the A4 would fit a better niche in my collection, [3] IMO the A4 is more futureproof, and [4] it actually turns out to be the better price-performance deal, and of course [5] I could afford it 

My review of the A4 is [here](http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2014/07/review-fostex-hp-a4-little-black-box.html), in it I also talk about the A3 a little.

My A4 is now doing service (and has been for a while, i belive it is on its second or third tour of duty) as the external DAC for my PS4, it runs optical in and uses the PS4 USB jack for power. It powers the headphones I usually game with just fine.",2015-09-18 02:49:31+00:00,cv5glx1,1.0,t3_3ld2un,13811.0,headphones

5082,"This price is an absolute steal.  With two caveats

First, the 267 has a flawed design that places too much stress on the plastic headband, so they break easily

AKG is supposed to have fixed the problem (the common consensus is that they added a reinforcing metal band to the headband to strengthen it). The long 267 thread on the other site also claims that only the first 7000 units had the flawed design, and that the newer the serial number, the better. I have no idea how accurate this assertion is.

Second, the price is crazy low on them because (according to mAssdrop) AKG is changing the packaging and trying to get rid of remaining stock with the old packaging. While this may be the case, there are other ways that a company can handle a packaging redesign.

Here's why I like the K267: the selectable bass settings. It sounds like a gimmick but they really work, and are a great option to have if you listen to lots of EDM. The 'stage' setting makes the K267 bass sound almost (and I say 'almost'!) like an XB500, and that is saying something. I believe the 'stage' setting boosts bass something like 9dB over the more neutral (but still warm-sounding) 'studio' setting.

So, tl;dr: if this is a newer version then the build quality should be OK. If it is a 1st gen AKG267, it is likely to be a lemon.

Having said this, I'm in for my second one, because you can't get enough bass when you are listening to dubstep :-)",2015-09-17 15:37:39+00:00,cv4rpdl,1.0,t3_3l92jr,48337.0,headphones
5083,"Nuforce was sold to Optoma a while ago, so I guess they are closing out B-stock.

For the price, IMO this is a reasonable choice for folks looking for cheap disposable IEMs. 

This is not for folks looking for the next Baldoor - you get what you pay for, so if you are looking for IE800 sound for $9, move along, nothing to see here. 

But what you get is a surprisingly well built pair of IEMs for the price, so if your idea of ""on the go"" is tossing your IEM into your pocket so that your tips suffocate or twisting the cable until it screams or generally committing acts of headphone abuse, then you will appreciate the 600x. And at $9, they are at a price point where you don't really care if you break them.

I have tested a couple of them to destruction, and IMO they should be on your shortlist if you are active, do not have much disposable income, and subject your daily wear IEMs to to much stress. But I wan't too thrilled about them, apart from the cheapness factor.

5110,"Until a couple of years ago, the $100 IEM market was dominated by a trio of headphones: at least, recommendations by audiophiles tended to distinctly favor one of the following 3 IEMs:

[1] the SE215 if you wanted bass, [2] the MA750 if you were looking for a more balanced sound, and [3] the RE400 if you were a devotee of neutrality.

Of course they had their own issues.  The SE215 could only be worn behind-the-ear style (you could use a haidryer and some ingenuity to mod the MA750 from a behind-the-ear IEM to a regular stick-it-in-and-go IEM), the RE400 had build quality that was so atrocious they might even fall apart if you sneezed, and the MA750....hmm what was the MA750's Achilles heel again?

Well it turns out that the MA750, unlike Achilles, didn't really have an obvious heel. Folks complained about detail and separation (a little better than average, but not equaling the RE400) or the lack of bass (compared to the 215) or even the or even the ho-hum treble (a little smeared and artificial-sounding) but these were all relatively minor issues compared to, well, your IEM falling apart if you sneezed, for example.

But no-one can complain about the build quality (steel! built like a tank! take that, Hifiman!) or the insanely good packaging + accessories (10 sets of spare tips!).

The problem is, the low-end IEM market has *really* changed in the last few years. Suddenly there are tons of options, mostly made by hitherto-unknown Chinese companies (think Fidue, Vsonic, Havi, Dunu) and even hitherto-known companies (think Philips, Audio ~~technical~~ Technica, even Beyerdynamic). Each of the competing $100 IEMs has it's own sonic flavor and comes with its own set of pluses and minuses, but my point is that now folks have a glut of choices for their $100, as opposed to the famine of a few years ago.

So who is the MA750 for? Well, it certainly continues to occupy a niche for those who want low-price, high-value balanced IEMs, but the niche is getting smaller and less comfortable all the time.....

absolutely. Just remember to add dramatic flair, and to cite your sources appropriately. For example:

*

It was a dark and stormy night and in an underground laboratory two scientists collected tissue samples and fixed them in 4% formaldehyde dissolved in 0.01 molar phosphate buffered saline for later use in physiological analysis. Suddenly, the tissue sample twitched. ""It's alive, it's alive, in the name of God!"" ^^1  one of the scientists exclaimed.

The problem with OTL tube amps is that their transformerless design means that the net impedance of the output tubes is high - high enough to make an audible difference.

On the other hand, the T1 has a high output impedance (if memory serves me right it is something like 10 ohms) because of ""suboptimal design"" (I'm trying to be kind!) of the output stage.

With respect to tube rolling for the T1Mk2, keep in mind that all new sensor reissues, whether they are branded as Electroharmonix or Genalex or Mullard or whatever, are *not* the same as NOS tubes and are essentially the same, so don't fall victim to hype and pay a premium for them.

after all, it's the lowest hanging fruit, isn't it?

and there's a reason folks grab on to them - for millennia gender and social constructs defined society, and women, minorities, the poor etc. ***always*** got a crappy hand when the cards were dealt to them.

I think of it more as *opportunity* rather than *nature vs nurture*. Do women get the same opportunities as men do for &lt;insert topic of discussion here&gt;?

So if you are a woman and want to be a priest in the Catholic church, the answer is an overwhelming ""no"". If you are poor and want to own your own private island in the Agean, ditto. But if you want to stick a pair of Maggies and a Emotiva XPA200 in your living room instead of a crappy Sony boombox, does it matter if you are a man or a woman? 

Most importantly, IMO the environment reflects the attitudes of *people* who inhabit it. And people define the opportunities that are available.

I was at a hi fi store some years ago auditioning speakers and I got bored and my attention wandered (you know how long those sessions can get!). I overheard the salesman talking to a couple who sounded like they were serious customers. The salesman was obsequious and brownnosing with the man and condescending and abrupt with the woman. He answered the man's dumb questions with care and attention and the woman's intelligent questions in an abrupt and haphazard manner.

5232,"If you are doing an interview, my suggestion is to get the most unobtrusive audio gear you can get. IEMs and a decent clip mic (or a smaller-sized on ear headset with a thin boom mic) are better than something that flashed LED lights or is purple and green. 

The objective is to look professional and get a job, not to prove to the universe what a huge [iron man fan you are](http://usb.brando.com/prod_img/zoom/UCART003800_07_L.jpg)

You also don't really need audiophile gear. Giant USB mics and a pop filter may be great for recording music and youtube videos, but the interviewer wants to see you, not a giant metal blob that covers your entire face.

And finally, 

&gt;better I buy expensive good ones than non-expensive ones which screw me over during the interview

It's more likely that it is your inability to answer questions appropriately (or provide the details that the interviewer wants) that screws you over the interview, not your hardware. 

Of course, test your gear before the interview with a friend to make sure there isn't feedback or echoing. And check your environment carefully. Make sure your background is appropriate (this would be a good time to take down that poster of Hitler on the wall behind you). Make sure that stuff that will cause interviewers to automatically fail you isn't visible on their screen, for example that gun on your table, unless you are interviewing with the NRA (this may not be the best time to let folks get a glimpse of your giant sex toy collection either). Dress appropriately.

And finally, make sure you are in a quiet place. Taking the interview when you are in a train that's going through the Channel Tunnel is probably a bad idea. When I interview folks on the internet, nothing is more frustrating than when I can't follow what they are saying because of background noise. Needless to say, if I don't get what I want from the interview, I move on rather than reschedule a repeat performance.

Have a good interview!

5234,"Some time ago,I suggested the WA7 actually made sense from a price-performance perspective. 

What, I hear you say, a premium audio product that has a ***price*** advantage?

The WA7 has four huge advantages, and a couple of minor cons.

First, let' get some of the basics out of the way.

1.Looks. It is gorgeous. And it looks [even better at night] (http://i.imgur.com/9oEJ0Gt.jpg). 

2.Because it is transformer coupled, it pairs well with a bunch of headphones. The 1/8 inch jack is optimized for IEMs, so you can use it with any of your IEMs too. In sum, you don't have to worry about how it is going to function with pretty much *any* headphones - sensitive IEMs, low or high impedance dynamic headphones, planars -- just don't try to stick a Stax into the WA7.

3.Excellent build quality. The pot feels solid and moves like butter. The glass block is flawless. The aluminum sparkles (at least the silver version does) and doesn't have flow or tool marks. 

4.It has zero floor noise. None. Nada. Even with my most finicky IEMs. Not many amps match up to that.

And let's get the WA7 sound out of the way too. It's not the typical tube amp - no ~~goods~~ gooey warm goodness here. It's not entirely neutral and transparent, though. I have previously described it as ""clean"".

And everything's not roses in in the WA7 garden either. It has some cons

1.It's not really an amp where you can roll tubes much. Choices are limited and horrendously expensive. 

2.It is smaller than it looks. And it is heavier than it should be, both the base and the glass block weigh a ton.

3.The tube power unit is more hype than anything else.  It also makes the whole unit look, well, a little kludgy. I have heard the WA7 with and without the tube power unit, and elected to buy mine without, both for the looks and the sound. IMO it's not worth the extra price of admission.

So what does all this add up to?

Don't buy a WA7 if you want warm gooey tube distorted sound. If you are unsure about your endgame headphones -- you know they won't be electrostatic, but can't decide between a bunch of full size and CIEM options, then the WA7 may be the one single piece of equipment that will pair reasonably well with pretty much any choice you end up making.  Which means that you won't have to endlessly shuffle amps/dacs as your headphone choices change. Which will actually save you money. Which is where the ""price advantage"" comes in.

If your Pistons are fake, sure the Shure will be better, absolutely.

And sound differences will probably be the most polarizing. Personally, I would prefer the smoother SE215 sound, I think the Piston high end is a little jangly and artificial-sounding. I also think the 215 does EDM better, with better bass extension and reach. The Piston 2 has somewhat more forward mids, which makes vocals sound either more immediate or too close, depending on your perspective.

5247,"Without doubt, Ultrasone. These headphones are more polarizing than even Grados, and for one and only one reason - S-logic. 

S-logic based on [this paper] (http://www.hifisentralen.no/forumet/attachments/hodetelefoner/141165d1339660581-ultrasone-edition-og-signature-116aes_pager.pdf) that Florian Konig, the founder of Ultrasone, wrote. I read it when I first tried to figure out what the term ""S-logic"" meant, and I think it is the best (and probably only) detailed explanation you are ever going to get on the topic, unless you count the bullshit on the Ultrasone website. 

The problem is that the paper is translated into English in such a clumsy way (I assume that it was not initially written in English) that many of the concepts are almost impossible to understand. It's like the paper was written by a Tamarian (""*Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel*""). 

Basically, in an ELI fashion, what Konig is trying to say is this: the sound gets better if you place the drivers in a ""decentric"" fashion  (i.e. in an inhumanly low position and angled weirdly) then something called ""head-related transfer"" occurs  and then the sound that travels through regular air conduction (via the drivers) and head-related transfer function are both picked up the brain and combined to create a magical 3D sound. You with me? Good, because I'm not sure I am.

Now to be fair, HD800 also utilizes a somewhat eccentric driver placement, and many IEMs add a component of bone conduction, and Ultrasone has a ton of patents for S-logic, and Florian Konig is clearly a very smart man, and his paper offers a reasonable scientific hypothesis to support decentral driver placement, so maybe there is something to it. Rather than depend on my biased opinion, read the paper for yourself and decide!

Suffice to say that depending on your perspective, S-Logic technology either improves the sound like the Traveler (whose name was unpronounceable by Humans) improved the warp drive of the USS Enterprise, or kills the sound more thoroughly than a Klingon warrior with a bat'leth.

I am of the latter persuasion. IMO the drivers are positioned weirdly, somewhere waaay below where my ears are, and I have normal size ears positioned where normal humans grow ears (I can confidently say that if you were Abe Sapien from ""Hellboy"" the pro 900 - and almost every other Ultrasone model, all the way up to the Edition 10 - would fit you just right). And even if it did fit (or probably because it did not), the S-logic just makes everything sound so weird. It just plain sounds wrong.

To be fair, I should add that  Ultrasone claims that one advantage of dicentric driver plcement is that their headphones subject you to less EM radiation than other headphones, and another touted pro is that you are less likely to sustain hearing loss with their headphones.

If memory serves me right the mayflower O2+ODAC combo doesn't have RCA outs, so you are stuck with one 3.5mm input jack and one 3.5mm headphones output. So there is no real way you can access the DAC output signal before it enters the O2 unless you open it up and engineer a solution.

This is why I don't like all-in-ones that make it difficult for you to upgrade.

If the only way you can connect the [O2+ODAC] is through the headphones out jack, then there's no point in you getting a control freak because you could just use the O2 pot to achieve the same effect.

IMO rather than jumping from one entry-level audio gear to another, you need a grand strategy, a long term plan, etc. 

It looks like you will be listening to both headphones and speakers for a while. Rather than corner yourself into another all-in-one, why not upgrade to a separate DAC and an amp? 

This way you can add or upgrade a single component without having to toss your entire setup. So you get a standalone DAC, which feeds your headphone amp and your powered speakers today, and tomorrow when you save up enough to buy a decent pair of passive speakers, you can toss your powered speakers, get an integrated amp to plug your DAC into, and  drive your neighbors crazy. And if you decide to upgrade headphones, you can get a better headphone amp without destroying your entire audio chain. Or upgrade your DAC to have *two* optical inputs, one for your PS4, and the other for your Xbone. I'm just saying' :-)

Plan B: Why not use a switch + a passive volume control out of your DAC - split the DAC signal to your O2, and also to the passive volume (and then split to your monitors). RCA splitters are cheap. Like really cheap. And you can get an emotiva control freak for around $50.

Also keep in mind that it's not enough to run balanced cable from your amp to your headphones, *every element of your signal* from the source to your ears needs to be balanced. So that means a balanced DAC too.

Having said that, there are two reasons to have a balanced setup. [1] because you can, and [2] because high-end audiophilia is often a peeing contest, and if you have a balanced rig it means you can pee further (and/or higher) into the Pacific Ocean than the dude next to you without a balanced set up.

5292,"&gt;Gibbs phenomenon and why you shouldn't set your DAC at 100%

Why do folks keep bringing poor Gibbs and his phenomenon into this? Another case of the  internet telephone phenomenon, methinks.

As applicable to DACs, Gibbs phenomenon refers to a ringing artifact - oscillation de to the step response of a low pass filter.What folks should be worried about when *any* audio equipment is at 100% is clipping, which is not the same as Gibbs phenomenon.

If your music clips when your something in your signal path is at 100%, then reduce the gain of the specific gear that is clipping. So if your amp clips, turn down the amp volume, and if your DAC clips, then turn down your OS volume. Even modest reductions may be sufficient to end clipping.

And finally, if your source is so compressed that it distorts at 100%, turn down the volume. That usually helps (but not much).

tl;dr: it it clips, you must curtail, but if it doesn't, don't!

And BTW, Gibbs didn't discover the math behind the Gibbs phenomenon anyway. [Henry Wilbraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wilbraham) did. Gibbs just ""rediscovered"" it. 

It's probably a good thing they didn't have lawsuits for this kind of thing in 1900. Plus, Wilbraham was long dead by then, and probably didn't care too much about IP. ",2015-08-30 02:41:20+00:00,cukd3az,1.0,t3_3iw5y2,15474.0,headphones

But with the 215, what you gain in bass you lose in detail. The 535s also have this modest upper mid bump that makes vocals shine. They don't have the significant treble rolloff that the 215 has and thus their high end doesn't sound recessed.

US$28 and change each? That, my friend, is a real steal.

BTW Brimar has an interesting history. Western Electric started up a UK office in the early 20th century. ITT Corp. (then International Telephone &amp; Telegraph) was interested in getting US tubes into the European market, and bought out the UK branch of Western Electric, set up a distribution chain, and marketed their tubes first as ""Standard"" and then as ""Brimar"".

ITT is interesting because it is an American company that owned 25% of Focke-Wolfe during World War 2 and then successfully filed for compensation for losses due to the fact that the Focke Wolfe factory was bombed by Allied planes. Go figure :-)

ITT sold their tubes division to Thorn in the 60s, and by that time the tube division was heavily into TV CRTs anyway, so they outsourced the production of Briar tubes to Mullard.

So what I am trying to say in my typically long-winded way is that if you have a post WW2 Brimar 5Z4GY then what you most likely have is a rebadged CV1863 Mullard tube.

5323,"I have only used the stock cable. They are strong and durable and I haven't really seen any reason to go aftermarket. Some people complain that the stock Shure cable is too stiff, but I find it to be just fine, and pleasingly free of microphonics.

I will say this: the black cable does not look good when paired with the transparent shells :-)

My primary source for music on the go is my phone. There's a reason for this. I usually have a bunch of Spotify playlists set up and ready to go for use when I am traveling, and when I get done with one I jut get rid of it and download the next playlist in the queue from wherever I am, usually using WiFi (and sometimes when I have no WiFi access and am desperate, using my cellular network). This means I ***always*** have upto 3000 songs on my phone ready for offline listening, wherever I am. And when I have network access I can stream Spotify wherever in the world I am.

Compared to the old days where I had to rerip my songs from CD or lossless to mp3 and then patiently upload playlist to my mp3 player, the convenience of a streaming service is simply impossible to resist for music fanatics like me.

I have tried a bunch of amps with my phone, and I would say the best of the bunch are the Fiio E18, the Sony PHA2 and the vmoda vamp verza, but in reality it's easier, more convenient, and less bulky to get a smartphone with decent audio out than to velcro or rubber band an amp/dac to a phone.

I have also tried a bunch of DAPs, and have a drawerful of stuff somewhere that I have bought and don't use anymore, but the tragedy is that there is no single perfect DAP that does everything I want it to (high quality sound, ability to access the internet and play/download Spotify, easy to carry around, long battery life, plus cheap enough that if I lose it I won't cry me a river of tears). The closest that anyone has come to my dream DAP is Sony, with the ZX1 (which I bought and returned) and the F-8xx series (which I bought and returned). But no cigar, at least not yet.

And the problem with standalone DAPs is that none have proven to be better than my old trusty Cowon D2. Either their user interface is crap (e.g. Fiio DAPs) or they have unacceptable floor noise (especially when paired with my 535, like the Sony A17) or they are simply not worth it from a price-performance perspective (e.g. AK240). 

And my Cowon D2 is like Dick Cheney. I'll explain why. Remember when George Bush was looking for a vice presidential running mate and picked Dick Cheney to head his VP selection committee, but then after a while the selection committee decided that *Dick Cheney himself* was the best candidate? Well I auditioned a bunch of DAPs and compared them to my D2 to see which one of the contenders was better, and then finally decided that the winner was *the D2 itself* :-) I can enumerate the reasons why, but that, as they say, is another story.

5325,"this is the usual Massdrop price, and a pretty good deal. 

Over the years, the SE535 has become my go-to travel pair of IEMs. They are comfortable, isolate well on planes and trains and automobiles, and most importantly are (at least for me) at the price-performance point where they sound *really* good and I won't get too upset if I break or lose them when I am on the go (which I have a habit of doing).

Their biggest attraction is their tight bass, warm and natural rendition of vocals and fatigue-free sound profile. I frequently switch musical genres, and the 535s ability to work with any genre thrown at them from DnB to classical is a definite asset, because that means I can travel with a single IEM, a phone, and a DAP and keep my carry-on audio gear to a minimum.They work great for the times when I am in the mood for a movie instead of music, too.

 Build quality is excellent, which is a good thing when you use them on the go, and the detachable cable is a bonus.

If I had to pick issues that I have with them, I would say the biggest cons of the 535 are [1] they can only be worn behind-the-ear style, [2] some people find the bulbous Shure shell design painful, especially with extended listening, [3] they can be finnicky to drive and have a propensity to enhance floor noise with some gear, and [4] the tubes are narrow, and made of plastic (unlike the 846) so every time I change the tips I am always scared I will break the tube.

And finally, I like clear Shures, but the issue with the clear models (and clear Shure cables) is that they all yellow a little over time, especially if you are out and about with them a lot. It's not a big deal for me, but some folks might shed a tear as they see their translucent 535 develop jaundice over time.....",2015-08-26 17:41:05+00:00,cughgre,1.0,t3_3ih03x,10743.0,headphones

But with the Sophia, you also get a very warm smooth tube sound, which when coupled with something like the HD650 can sound very dark indeed, so folks who worship neutrality will probably consider the WA6 to be the Antichrist.

On the other hand the WA6 tames Beyer treble a little, and highlights the tremendous bass of the LCD2 and 3. IMO it also alters the way Grados sound to a point where, well, they don't really sound like Grados anymore.

Because it is transformer coupled the WA6 can handle low impedance headphones without making them sound flabby, and it works with IEMs because it does not inject much floor noise into the signal. This versatility means that the WA6 may actually be the last headphone amp you need, which makes it a price performance champ as long as you don't have the urge to update after being hypnotized by Princess glow at night :-)

The choice of service really depends on their catalog, some services may fit your musical tastes more than others, unless of course you are an Apple fanboy, in which case your option is limited to Beats Music. I like Spotify Premium myself, but I also subscribe to Tidal, mainly because I can.

If you want specific hard-to-get recordings, or want a physical copy of your music, or want the ability to rip your music into different formats - CD. For some genres, like classical, you may have no choice but to desperately hunt for physical media, much like Lindsay Lohan is hunting for her career.

If the response you get from folks when you ask them if they have any new jungle in, guy is ""*I got the Tarzan and Jane of Jungle just swinging on in the vine this morning man*"" then they should get into vinyl too, because there is some stuff out there on vinyl that could turn Hare Krishna into a bad boy, for example [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSgrPq-MXss)

5352,"Burson calls the Soloist SL "" a concentrated version of the Soloist"" but it has some significant differences when compared to its bigger sibling. 

First, it isn't as heavy, the SL enclosure (although it's gorgeous enough) isn't as beefy as the regular Soloist, which has this Apple-like machined aluminum shell.

Second, and probably most noticeably, the SL has an ALPS pot like any other amp, instead of the stepped attenuator that the Soloist has.

Third, the SL delivers 2 WPC at 16 ohms (compared to the Soloist's Lyr-esque 4 WPC).

And to round out the differences, the SL does not have RCA outs (so can't serve as a preamp for your main rig), and has only 2 gain settings (in contrast to 3).

Having said that, the SL is no slouch when it comes to delivering the audio goods. If I had to describe it in a word, I would say ""natural"". Vocals and instruments sound rich, and treble is crisp (which IMO sums up the Burson house sound rather well).

The SL pairs very well with Audeze, and certainly has the power to handle most planars. Some folks don't like the Burson + HD800 pairing because the combo veers too much into bright territory, but it pairs well with the 600, and especially the 650. I'm not a huge fan of coupling it with most AKG headphones because the treble sounds even more plasticky and unnatural. Soloist SL + Beyer T1/ DT990 can be a fatiguing combination.

The Soloist is one of my favorite headphones amps, but it's usual price of $1000 may be too rich for some folks. The SL is a reasonable compromise for those who desire Burson sound but can't afford (or don't want to own) the Soloist or Conductor. The SL usually retails for around $650, and I have seen it dip down to $600 occasionally on sale, but $530 including shipping is indeed a steal for the SL.

Califone was founded by this dude called Robert Metzner, who was an inventor who graduated from Caltech in the 1930s and during World War 2 sold recording phonographs tho folks who needed transcription services. He then started a company (Roberts Recordings) that ended up bringing the first commercial tape decks to the US market (they were rebadged Akai tape decks). 

Califone was the educational division of Roberts Recordings and focused on selling products to schools and educational organizations. It's probably easier to buy Califone headphones in bulk than as a single pair.

BTW, Metzner also designed and built a hybrid electric car in the 70s, long before a Tesla did 0-60 in 2.8 seconds :-)

5404,"ouch that sucks

sorry to hear dude

if both surviving power tubes are the same model (ie 6H6Pi) then IMO you should be OK to combine them into a working whole

Matched pairs are overrated, to an extent. If the seller has a bunch of random stock, then matching may help ensure you get 2 similar tubes. But if the seller is pulling tubes from a single batch, most likely you aren't going to get audible differences from the minor deviations from tolerances the tubes will have.

Some other thoughts that may help:

If you are buying a single power tube, make sure you [1] get the same model type and brand, ie if Reflektor then Reflektor , if Svetlana then Svetlana and [2] one made at approximately the same timeframe as your surviving tube (ie around the same year) to avoid crazy audible mismatches.

Dont match similar tubes, ie 6H30PI and 6H30EB. Dont match Russian 6N6P and Chinese 6N6 tubes.

Try to match tubes that have OTK stamps - OTK was the Russian QI stamp, and suggests that they passed the minimum QI standards of the factory.

Try not to match EB labeled tubes with non EB labeled tubes - EB tubes were guaranteed for a longer life than non EB tubes and typically had a slightly different design.

And finally, 6H pi Gold tubes can get plenty expensive. Dont pay the ridiuclous premiums some sellers demand, especially if they are resissue ElectroHarmonix and not the old NOS Reflektors or Svetlanas. You may be better off stalking ebay for a 6H pi and pouncing when you find one on sale and in the interim getting a pair of cheap Novosibirsk 6H6s. You won't be able to tell a night and day difference between them and the EHs. I promise :-)",2015-08-19 04:05:03+00:00,cu7wjob,1.0,t3_3hj66l,5453.0,headphones

Some angled pad mods like the rope mod for the HE400 (sometimes called the angled foam mod) or the SRH940 rope mod, are just, well, *bad*. Sometimes even stock angled pads make headphones sound less pleasing than regular pads (e.g. the NVX XPT100, which comes with both regular and angled pads).

IMO Audeze got angled pads right, but trying to DIY Audeze-like sound with headphones that were not intended to be used that way isn't viable.

Bottom line: the normal HM5 pad pairs well with the V6 and are super comfortable. Why mess with a good recipe? :-)",2015-08-17 21:58:02+00:00,cu6d7xm,3.0,t1_cu6bn7n,2501.0,headphones

5439,"1. First, change the uncomfortable stock earpads that also detract from the sound. I tried the DT250 velour pads for a while, but after the rest of my mods (see below) ended up preferring the Brainwavz HM5 pads. There a little groove running all the way around the lip of the MDRV6 earcups that you are supposed to feed the free edge of the pad into. I found the HM5 pads to be a little loose in this configuration, but when  you wrap the free edge of the HM5 pad around the *entire* MDRV6 earcup, it fits nice and snugly. Plus I deluded myself that isolation and soundstage were improved a little this way.

2. You can stick a thin layer of Dynamat / acoustimat on the inside of the cups. I used a criss cross hatched pattern of acoustimat strips, and it cut down some of the jangly resonances and tamed the upper mids a little to sound a little more realistic.

3. I cut and placed a thin oval of soft-density foam in front of the drivers (just in front of the perforated metal protector grille), it smoothed out the treble and reduced fatigue during extended listening sessions.

4. Oh, and if you are so inclined, get rid of the crappy ""for digital"" stickers.",2015-08-17 15:22:05+00:00,cu5xta8,1.0,t3_3hbofi,158.0,headphones

If you find the stock pads uncomfortable (as I did) you can always swap out the Beyer DT250 velour pads, it is an exact size fit and takes all of 3-5 minutes to mod, without the need for any tools. The DT250 pads do rob the bass a little, but add to comfort.

Brainwavz HM5 pads are another option, they are a little big but if you wrap them around the earcup instead of trying to stuff the free edge into the little groove, they fit just fine.",2015-08-17 07:15:21+00:00,cu5o1jy,1.0,t3_3haf7t,202.0,headphones

Instead, to answer your question in a general way: Both sound quality and soundstage will suffer. 

Some old headphones have independent volume controls. Some newer headphones do too, for example the Senn HD65, which has a convenient dual volume slider on the cord. It's pretty cheap too, by headphone standards.

IEMs may help deal with issues because of ambient noise and may actually be preferable also because you need to turn up the volume less than, say open full sized headphones.

Some headphones are specifically marketed for folks who cant hear well from one ear, for example www.yuniheadphones.com but I have no idea how much of a gimmick they are.

Hope this helps, and that you find something for your mom that works well for her.

In reality, folks who get their music from torrents have no real clue what the original sources that the torrent files were ripped from actually were -- I could take a 128k mp3 and re-rip it to a flac file and it would still sound like, well, 128k mp3. Because ripiing a file in a lossy format is like losing your virginity - what thou hast lost, thou cannot regain.

And yes, some of my Spotify Premium files sound fantastic, but some don not. That may be because not all Spotify premium files are ripped in 320 kbps Ogg, but it may also be due to the fact that the record company gave Spotify a crappy master in the first place.

Music files have become like paintings: unless you know their provenance, you never know if you got a real Vermeer or just a Han van Meegeren.

1. First, the output stage seamlessly transitions from class A to push-pull class A to class AB depending on current load which is not only an efficiency gain but also helps reduce distortion.

2. It puts out so much power, heck if your amp fails you can directly wire your lyr 2 to your speakers (I jest, but you get the idea)

3. You can roll tubes. Sure, it's not as fun as tube rolling a valhalla 2, but 2 is better than 0, right? Right?

4. You can plug your sensitive IEMs in, set the Lyr 2 on high gain, and proceed to ***blow them up***. because nothing is better after an extended listening session than the smell of napalm in the morning.

5504,"There are two reasons why folks can hear differences between two differently encoded songs: [1] there *is* a difference, and folks hear it, and [2] there *isn't* a difference, but folks hear one anyway (psychoacoustic phenomenon).

Of course there's a 3rd option: there *is* a difference, but  folks don't hear it, which probably suggests they are going deaf :-)

We've seen lots of discussions about lossy vs lossless formats and whether folks can hear a difference or not, but this post will be a little different than the usual fare, so keep reading!

We all have a ""threshold of discrimination"", not just for music, but for pretty much everything in life. Some people are better at telling one type of wine from another, others at identifying nuanced differences in perfumes, or colors, or have different 2-point-discrimination levels for touch. That's just how our special senses work.

And finding nuanced differences is often easier with training, so someone who has passed a Master of Wine exam is typically better at telling nuanced differences between wines than someone's whose oenophilia is limited to buying bottles of two buck Chuck from Trader Joes.

And Candice Olson or Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen are probably better at telling the difference between Chartreuse (#DFFF00) and Bitter Lime (#BFFF00) than, say, I am.

But at some point these nuances become so, well, nuanced that it comes difficult to figure out whether there really *is* a difference at all. And since everyone's threshold of discrimination is different, YMMV.

Other times, because we so desperately want to find a difference because we are straining to find one, we unconsciously invent a difference where none actually exists. And you see this phenomenon in audiophila all the time. It's perfectly innocent and IMO a feature of human nature.

But sometimes folks report they hear a difference merely to pump up hype for a product, or boost sales, or mislead other folks. You see a lot of this in audiophile land too, and that's *not* so innocent.

Also keep in mind that just swapping the DAC around doesn't really affect sound as much as, say, swapping the amp or headphones around. Of course there are exceptions, but in general most modern DACs sound very similar.

So what do I think? Some folks have golden ears, and can indeed consistently tell the difference between songs encoded in Q4 vorbis and flac.  Others, for example those who claim that they can tell the difference between 2 lossless files like wav and flac, or between 16 bit depth and 24 bit depth, are either lying or genuinely misinformed.

Plus windows audio stack up converts all streams to a 32-bit floating-point sample depth anyway, if you have anything newer than XP. ",2015-08-11 14:38:58+00:00,ctz62d6,1.0,t3_3gk3ly,33799.0,headphones

He built most of them in his kitchen :-)

He started his own company (the Baldwin radio company) to market his headphones and other inventions, but it went bankrupt after a while because Baldwin was, well, a weird dude. He was a Mormon who was a very vocal supporter of polygamy, and thanks to his sociopolitical views he ended up losing a lot of the public's support.

And somehow he never managed to patent the concept of headphones, so you can only imagine now much $ he and his descendants have lost since the 1910s, especially from Jimmy Iovine and Dre.

IMO you are a gradophile (not that there is anything wrong with that)., i.e. the grado sound signature speaks to you in a way that no other headphones can, because no other headphones sound like a Grado.

IMO your choice favopring the GS1000s are not about the detailed mids or the separation, objectively I think headphones like the HD800 or even the T1 have the GS1K beat in these departments, but about how grado sound makes some genres of music sound energetic without sounding overly bright. If that's what your heart desires, then Grado delivers. If not, then Grado disappoints.

Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive far, far away, amongst the stars.*

****

In order to avoid getting into the weeds too much, I'm going to oversimplify the concepts in this post. NOS DACs have been around for a long time. To understand what ""nonoversampling"" is, I guess we first have to check out what ""oversmapling"" implies.

In sum, oversampling is the method by which a higher sampling rate than needed is used to run the digital to analog converter. this increases the *rate* of the signal - so if you sample twice instead of once in the same time frame, you get twice the rate, and this is associated with some advantages - most important of which is that it reduces the effort required to filter the signal after D/A conversion.

So  if you oversample the signal, in essence you move the image frequencies higher, and so you can implement a simpler (and less expensive) analog filter in the signal path *after* D/A conversion to clean up the sound.

There are also other advantages to oversampling - an increase in the signal to noise ratio, generating a more linear response, and reducing quantization noise (because oversampling spreads it out over a larger frequency range) for example.

And keep in mind that one advantage of oversampling is that it pushes undesirable harmonics *way up high* into the stratosphere, which means you and I (and maybe even your dog) can't hear them.

So now we have come to a stage of our lives where everyone and their grandmother have embraced oversampling, and sigma delta DACs (that have pushed this concept to the very edge) rule the DAC world, and therefore every sigma delta DAC now sounds like every other sigma delta DAC, i.e. *bo-ring!*.

But even before you had oversampling, you had, well, non oversampling. Because NOS DACs don't oversample the sound, objectively they measure like, well, crap. They also need to utilize more inventive techniques to output filter the sound, but in essence the actual design of a NOS DAC   is more simple than its modern sigma delta cousins, whether you use a R2R ladder or related architecture. And forget about fancy schmancy analog filter implementations, some NOS DAC implementations actually depend on *your ear*, or to be more specific the basilar membrane of your ear, to act in part as the output filter :-)

Since they don't really make NOS DAC chips anymore, folks have to rely on a ever-decreasing supply of Phillps chips made in the 80s, or come up with their own design, which makes NOS DACs the DAC equivalent of tube amps.

What does this all mean in real-world terms? Typically NOS DACs have a colored sound profile, with significant distortion as you head up the frequency spectrum. This usually leads to a warmer sound than their sigma delta counterparts and significant amounts of treble smear, which of course is anathema if you are an objectivist. 

in fact every objectivist who carries a party membership card (no-one knows what these cards actually say because they are all randomized and double, nay *triple* blinded) will tell you to avoid NOS DACs like the plague because they detract from the sound. And they may be right.

But a NOS DAC is part of my favorite sub-$1000 setup, not because of any considerations of technical accuracy but because it offers a potential to end the tyranny of sigma delta DACs that we have been subjected to in the last decade or two. And an NOS DAC lets us revel in warm gooey euphonic sound in a very decadent and, well, *ooo la la* way. 

I talk more about NOS DACs in my review of my favorite NOS DAC, the Project DAC S FL [here] (https://as.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1zvo07/the_postman_always_knocks_twice_when_he_delivers/). This DAC probably gets more listening time than any other DAC I own, which is saying something.

But seriously, you are right - many of us are fortunate that we can afford our hobbies, but hobbies, just like any other addiction, can spiral out of control. To make a hobby worthwhile in the long run, folks need to set priorities + budgets, and stick to them. 

And if someone is spending more on headphones (or on any other hobby) than they are on the basic necessities of life, or on their education, or their family, then IMO they are doing something wrong.

And finally, I'll say this: all of us who spend our time perusing this sub and planning our next headphone purchase easily forget that there are millions of people right now who are tired and hungry and can't fix it because they don't have disposable incomes  (or nutritious food or clean water or shelter, for that matter) and the very last thing on their minds is whether open or closed headphones are better to listen to the HFO version of ""Hotel California"" because they are in their own personal hell and it has literally frozen over.

So if you have the means to sustain a hobby or two, why not take a small fraction of your disposable income and use it to help someone who is desperate, or sustain someone who has lost their dignity.

5617,"There really isn't a problem with Windows sound anymore. Let me explain.

There was a time when windows sound drivers sucked. Big time. That's the reason why ASIO was popularized, to get away from the crappy Windows Kmixer kernel that mangled sound like a testicular vice and had more latency than Bill Cosby's statute of limitations.

Steinberg developed ASIO (Audio stream I/O) to bypass the truly terrible Windows NT 5.x Kmixer kernel. When ASIO was released the pro audio community jumped on ASIO not only because it was capable of direct bit perfect delivery, but also because it supported 24 bit sampling (Win only managed a max of 16 bit at the time). 

But Windows has come a long way since the days of Kmixer, which was discontinued for the Win Vista release. 
Since vista, windows has implemented an entirely new audio stack protocol, and kmixer is gone. WASAPI (Windows Audio Session API) and WaveRT are spectacularly superior in comparison to kmixer, and better technology than ASIO.

Kmixer also had a terrible tendency to cause massive clipping at high volumes, and this is again another problem that has been addressed very well in subsequent stack protocol implementations (vista, 7, and now 8 and 10)

But folks still cling to ASIO like it magically transforms the audio stream into something, well, magical, and audiophile forums still tout ASIO like it is the driver equivalent of solid silver cables. Yes, its a reasonable option if you are using DAWs (for example I still use ASIO at times with my FL Studio, but thats not because of SQ but because of convenience). For routine music listening, it is probably easier to use win audio stack if you have win 7/8 rather than ASIO. 

And people seem to have forgotten how clunky ASIO really is. Even the touted ""bitrate advantage"" of ASIO is no advantage at all. In windows 7 and above, all system sounds that are resampled to whatever setting you set in the output device sample rate.

If you A/B ASIO vs win audio stack or WASAPI exclusive mode and think ASIO sounds significantly better, you are demonstrating expectation bias, IMO. Either that or you believe in unicorns and the Easter bunny.

If you must run foobar on an exclusive mode (because you don't want to be distracted by system sounds, for example), then run WASAPI. 

What does WASAPI do? To put it simply, think of WASAPI as a pipe -- a way for an application (such as Foobar) to manage the flow of data between itself and an end-device (such as an external DAC). This bypasses the Windows Direct Sound drivers, and disables extraneous system sounds when you are listening to music. More [here] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd371455.aspx)

So what's the huge advantage in running wasapi or asio over native windows drivers? Well, that's a good question, and the answer is ""*not much*"".

IMO the only advantage of using an external driver is this: if you don't want irritating system noises when you are listening why then wasapi exclusive mode bypasses them.

tl;dr: Stick to Win 7/8/10 native sound, unless your application does not support it. ASIO is *so* 20th century :-)",2015-08-01 14:58:25+00:00,ctnxqvm,1.0,t3_3fehls,8205.0,headphones

Plus boy is your dad going to be in for a hell of a surprise when after listening to years of Pink Floyd and EW&amp;F you introduce him to Autopilot Off :-)

Here's what i would suggest: if you are going to be using the Macbook as his source, i would consider building him a listening station so that he can enjoy his music while chilling on his recliner :-)

While closed headphones sound attractive because they offer isolation + prevents folks nearby from hearing what he is listening to, IMO for a broad range of musical tastes you are probably better off going with an open pair to get the most bang for your buck, musically speaking. You don't want to overwhelm him with bass, as most midfi closed headphones (and some endgame ones too!) can do.

If you must go with closed headphones, keeping in mind your budget I would suggest the NAD Viso HP50 or the PSB M4U1, both of which will work well for a bunch of genres, and neither of which need an amp to sound their best - just plug them into the macbook and you are good to go. The only caveat I would have is that if your dad has a big head he may find the HP50 uncomfortable for extended listening sessions.

But here is option #2. Get a HD600 or 650 if you can find one on sale, and a Schiit M+M stack. Yes the Senns are open, but looking at your picture the recliner is tucked against a corner of the room and the sound bleed should not be too bad, especially if your dad doesn't listen at super high levels.

If you snag headphones for cheap you can conceivably pull this off for a little over $500. And if your pockets stretch deeper, consider swapping the magni with a Valhalla 2, which will give his listening station tube sound and a great old school aesthetic.

The best part of choosing something like the HD650 is that it will work great for both Pink Floyd *and* Madeon (btw, isn't ""adventure"" a cool album?), so he gets a great experience no matter what genre you throw at him. And you really don't need to upgrade beyond the 600/650 unless you want to, so unless he is a hugely nitpicking audiophile (doesnt sound like he is), he is probably literally set for life when it comes to headphones.

Hope this helps,

These indeed look like they are Nakamichi NK2030s. And though they may look like Senns, they don't have anything to do with Senn.

They don't even have anything to do with the ""real"" Nakamichi of the 70s and 80s. 

Nakamichi used to make solid electronics (like cassette decks!), including headphones in the 70s/80s. They actually did a deal with Toyota to do audio for Lexus models, but at some point lost out to Harman International (who owns Mark Levinson) .

Sometime in the 1990s Nakamichi went bankrupt. They were bought out by a Chinese company that tried to reposition the brand. They did come out with some cool ideas (like the [Lumos] (http://www.nakamichi.com/pfv/DVD/lumos.htm))  but their headphones are OEMs and are, well, very meh.

The brains behind the old Nakamichi, Niro Nakamichi started a company called Mechanical Research Corporation that came up with some [interesting products] (http://www.stereotimes.com/amp051502.shtml). But that had not much to do with the Nakamichi of the good old days either.

tl;dr: if you find a vintage Nakamichi, you may have something. If you have a random modern Nakamichi like OP did, you have got nada.

See, it doesn't work like that. The only place people regularly get *blown away* is on headfi, but it's OK over there because almost all headphones are *holographic* so no damage done.

First, make sure your source is on par with your headphones. There's no need to rush to buy vinyl or rerip all your CDs to flac, but if the bulk of your listening is from poorly ripped torrents or, even worse, youtube, you  may want to think about how you can get the best signal you can.

Also make sure that your E10 isn't distorting the sound, especially if you are double amping.

Next, give it some time for your ears to get used to the HD650. Open headphones don't sound the same as closed headphones, and the M50 and the 650 have *very* different sound profiles.

So listen exclusively with the 650 for a couple of weeks, and then go back to the M50s. If the M50 still sounds better, then maybe the 650 is not for you.

5671,"The open, on-ear Portapros have been around since 1984, and since then their box and packaging has changed far more than the actual headphones have. 

They are available in a multitude of colors in Europe, but in the US they are like the Ford Model T - you can get them in any color as long as it is black. they were great value for money in the 80s, and they continue to be price-performance champs today. IMO the Sennheiser PX100 and the Portapro were the reigning price-performance champions of entry-level on-ear headphones for the longest time. 

Their design was certainly unique when they were released, and even though today they look more retro than a Buick Roadmaster, it's still a pretty innovative design with its collapsible headband and little hook that secures the collapsed headphone. The ability to adjust clamp tension is very cool, and the way it is implemented is ingenious. 

They look as fragile as gossamer, and even though you can compress them and throw them into a case and carry them around, they are probably not your best option for on-the-go listening because [1] they leak sound like a sieve and [2] did I mention they are as fragile as gossamer?

They are comfortable even for extended sessions, even though you can never really forget that you are wearing on-ears because, well, they are on your ears.

The biggest surprise, though is how they sound. The Portapro sound is remarkably rich and inviting. Bass is more than adequate, even for EDM, and more prominent than what you expect for open on-ears. Even though it is a little muddy and sub-bass is less prominent than you would like, these shortcomings can be overlooked because of the overall sound package, especially the warm and detailed mids. Treble features significant rolloff - Grados they most certainly are not.

My pet peeve with the Portapro: the bare metal headband sometimes catches your hair when you take your Portapros off. Painful.

IMO the best part about the Portapro: they come with Koss' famous lifetime warranty. If you break them, ship them to Koss and, for a nominal charge, they replace them. And unlike some other headphone manufacturers, they typically do not give you a hard time, so you can rinse and repeat, if you want to.

Who are the Portapros for? I would say if you are saving up for a higher level of headphones and money is tight, pass on them. Considering that you can get the SR60e or the Mertin Logan Mikros 90 (when it is on sale) for $80 or thereabouts, upgrading to the next level of on-ears isn't that expensive. 

And if you are looking at getting something like the B&amp;W P5 or the DT1350, you are never going to be happy with owing just the Portapro anyway so you might as well stick your change in the bank and save up for the big foil prize rather than squander all your mana on little minions like the Portapro (Mana cost: 1 Forest, Type: On-ear, Card text: *Unchanged since Debbie Gibson recorded Only In My Dreams*, Flavor text: *""Eh, needs more toad."" - Gulistan, Simic biomancer*, Rarity: Common.)

But if you are looking for a pair of disposable on-ears, or you are curious about what true price-performance champions sound like, or you are willing to give up your daily latte for a couple of weeks, then IMO you cannot go wrong with the Portapros. They bat way above their league, especially when they are on sale for $20.

Can Portapros ever be considered your endgame headphone purchase? Not really, but you could always try, [like I did] (https://i.imgur.com/XMe3n0r.jpg).

The DAP market isn;t really a huge growth segment per se. Apple knocked the crap out of old-school DAP manufacturers like cowon and iRiver and Creative and Philips, and the only reason Sansa has a presence in the marketspace against the ubiquitous iDAPs is because it is dirt cheap.

And of course the advent of the smartphone and streaming services really pushed the last nails into the DAP coffin, because unless you are an audiophile you don't really want to carry a phone *and* a DAP.

But high end DAPs have continued to flourish because, well, profit margins are much higher with TOTL DAPs, so you need to sell less DAPs to make more $, and that's a compelling argument to jump into the market even when everyone and their grandmother has an iPod.

Plus iRiver turned their fortunes around because of their A&amp;K brand, and I'm sure other audio companies have taken notice

and finally, if you are a ""premium"" audio company positioned for the high end market (like AR is) then you don't want to devalue your brand by putting out entry level stuff, so that's another primary motivation for folks to keep to the ""high end"" if they are already occupying that territory",2015-07-24 19:21:46+00:00,ctewzx9,3.0,t1_ctewn4m,521.0,headphones

nwavguy actually specified the LED in the O2 design, so changing it technically violates his CC license.

no such thing as an ignorant question. You might have just opened pandora's box and started the battle between Objective and Subjective forces, though -- like Geser and Zavulon they have been at it for eons throwing the same old tired old cliches at each other :-)



I'll try and answer your questions without falling into the same trap


&gt;how was the O2 designed to be so allegedly transparent and yet so cheap?

Because ""transparent"" does not have to be ""expensive"".  Good audio designs can be cheap, and expensive products can have terrible designs. 

&gt;Why is audio gear not cheaper?

As with any hobby, supply and demand determine market prices. There are a bunch of audiophiles who are willing to pay a lot of $$$ for minor improvements in sound quality. The market caters to them

&gt;The fact that this massdrop model is cheaper than a DIY kit from mayflower makes no sense to me

Essentially there are 4 aspects to the cost of any product [1] R&amp;D [2] materials [3] manufacturing and [4] marketing.
R&amp;D is variable, so calculating the cost of R&amp;D for an individual amp is difficult. In the case of nwavvguy's O2 design, he did it for free, so the R&amp;D costs were essentially zero.

Material costs vary over time, often wildly, and are subject to supply and demand constraints. If you are a Chinese OEM, you can get your hands on components for much cheaper than if you are a DIYer buying your components from Mouser. Also, volume purchasing reduces costs substantially. Supposing I'm a small-scale headophone amp manufacturer buying a few hundred capacitors, I will end up paying more for them than if I am an electronics OEM buying tens of thousands of the same capacitor at a time.

Production costs also vary. For the JDS or Mayflower O2, production costs are essentially the cost of the time taken by one person to assemble, package and ship them in the US.  For Massdrop, it is the cost of one person at the OEM in China. Taking into account prevailing wages in the US and China, it's cheaper to assemble stuff in China than the US. But moving production to China does not necessarily make things cheaper, for example some Audio Gd amps probably cost more to make than equivalent Schiit amps, even though Schiit makes its stuff in the US and Audio Gd in China. 

It's not just massdrop - many companies OEM some or all of production, which again affects costs depending on who they OEM to. And it's not just a case of folks using cheap Chinese OEMs - some Denons for example were OEMd by Fostex. And keep in mind that OEM companies typically conduct their own R&amp;D, have their own design costs, have to retool equipment for specific products, etc, which changes cost calculations.

And finally marketing: some companies spend more on marketing (e.g. Apple, Nike, Beats) and make huge profits, while others spend very little on traditional marketing (e.g. Schiit) and still manage to do very well for themselves.

&gt;If nwavguy claims that the O2 is the only amp you'll ever need, are people who buy more expensive amps really just looking to colour their sound?

Sure, some people are looking for a specific sound profile. But in general, as you go up the audiophile amp ladder, what you are really paying all those extra $$$ for are [1] features, [2] quality of components, and [3] brand name and bragging rights.

5713,"At $70, the MDO2 has the potential to be a disruptive force in the domain of low-end headphone amps.

For folks bemoaning the lack of rear power and a 1/4 inch jack, both those mods (from the original nwavguy design) are for convenience, and do not affect sound quality. The O2 with a rear power jack and a 1/4 inch headphone jack is $170 from Mayflower. Are those two features worth the extra $100? I leave it to you to decide....

The beauty of nwavguy's amp design isn't it's elegance, or it's convenience, it is the fact that you can get a relatively transparent headphone amp for much less than - in some cases thousands of dollars less than - ""high-end audiophile"" gear that achieves the same effect.

A transparent amp does exactly that - it get out of the way of the music signal and transmits the source without much alteration to the headphones, so what you hear is because of everything in the audio chain *except* the amp. And the O2 does this very well. If you are a devotee of transparent sound, I could argue that you don't really need an upgrade above &amp; beyond the O2, even if you spring for TOTL headphones.

In theory the O2 is portable because it has batteries, but in reality good luck using it as your portable rig.

Keep in mind that this is just the amp - if you want an entirely external audio source for your headphones you will still need to invest in an external DAC. And at the MDO2 price point, the worthy competitor to note is the monoprice desktop amp, which incorporates a DAC.

So who is affected by this product? JDS and Mayflower certainly, because the MDo2 is definitely going to undercut their sales. But Schiit sales are also going to be spanked a little IMO, because at the $70 price point there is now less reason to buy a magni 2 unless you want to use the RCA jacks on the magni2. 

Even though the MDo2 will take 2 months to get to you (and, knowing mAssdrop, probably even longer), $70 is a powerful reason to shut up and wait :-)",2015-07-24 15:18:12+00:00,cten1h0,1.0,t3_3efxpe,7088.0,headphones

yup

Here's what I think. Buying a  Sennheiser or a Foster is like buying a BMW or a Honda - overall you get decent build quality, it does what you want it to, and design principles are solid.

Buying a Grado is like buying a Morgan. It's got poor build quality, it creaks and rattles like crazy, the design is suboptimal and you end up getting wind all over your face, and most people won't like the experience. But if you are into tiny roadsters (and only if you are into tiny roadsters!) you will find the Morgan to be a very enjoyable car.

Similarly, if you are into Grado sound (and only if you are into Grado sound!) you will put up will all the other little quirks and vagaries of owning a Grado.

The matrix mstage gets very little love, either here or on headfi. 

Matrix is known to ""be inspired"" by other brands, for example bel Canto for the mini-i, and they channeled Lehmann's Black Cube Linear for the Mstage design. In fact they channeled it so much they could almost be twins :-)

It has a very solid PCM1793 DAC and also works as a standalone headphone amp using RCA in. If memory serves me right the opamp is no slouch either (LME49720). It has a 5 ohm output impedance, and can deliver 400 mW at 60 ohms (half that much at 300 ohms), so can power pretty much any mid-fi headphone model.
The only significant minus I can think of is that some reviews talk about substantial buzzing with IEMs. Also, there is no gain selection switch (it's fixed @ +15 dB, I think). 

The Magni looks better on paper, and when you hear them IMO the magni is brighter, the mstage is a little warmer and the O2 is the most neutral of the three.

So as a first attempt, we will try to post automated stickies 4 days of the week, and manually generated stickies for the other days of the week. This will be in addition to the daily purchase sticky, which will continue as is.

Of course, we are open to suggestions, and will take a look at the rotation and popularilty of each thread, and shuffle the deck with new cards if necessary.

So what are the topics for the 2nd sticky? This is what we have right now , but we reserve the right to change our minds between now and when Arve writes them into automod, so YMMV.

5761,"There are three issues with leaving tube amps on all the time

First, tubes are like replicants -- they have a finite life span. if you leave them on 24/7, that's less time you get to listen with them before they burn out (and sooner or later, they all do).

Second, it's not just tubes -- *all* components in an amp, even solid state ones like caps and resistors, can fail with prolonged use. 

Third, heat does weird things to electronic components. Resistor values can change, sometimes outside tolerances. That's true for tubes too. So just as you want to warm up tubes before using them, you want to keep them from overheating beyond specifications.

Keep in mind tubes may *look* delicate, but they are pretty solid.  After all, many of them were designed to be used in mission-critical systems, like, oh, guided missiles, for example.

Many tube amp manufacturers include instructions to use their equiopment for ""up to 8 hours at a time"". Where did this magical 8-hour rule come from? I have no idea. But I usually end up following this rule, because I turn my tube amp before I start listening, and turn them off after I am done, and I'm usually not listening for more than 8 hours continuously.",2015-07-21 04:30:24+00:00,ctak1fy,1.0,t3_3dzwtx,23820.0,headphones

Now that will be fine for EDM, but if you listen mostly to classical/jazz/folk, it isn't the best option because you want a sound profile that's a little more neutral.

So consider the Sony MDRV6 or 7506, whichever is cheaper (they are pretty much identical). They are closed, portable, and because they are relatively neutral they pair well with your preferred genres. 

Alternatively, if you don't mind IEMs consider the SE315. IMO it is a [sleeper] (http://pa3p.blogspot.com/2014/08/have-you-ever-danced-with-devil-in-pale.html) and a great choice for classical / folk / jazz",2015-07-19 16:42:37+00:00,ct8qrub,2.0,t1_ct8kb9m,16390.0,headphones

You should call up Senn customer service and say ""*[Senn, let my headphones go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahkwQhQZWG8)!*""

So here are a few Commandments:

Veni's First commandment: Thou shalt not wet thy headphones on purpose, unless thou art truly desperate

Veni's Second commandment: Spilling thy coffee on thy headphones might void thy warranty

Veni's Third commandment: Take the pads off, and wipe down the headphones with a moist cloth (preferably microfiber so that you don't leave a residue)

Veni's Fourth commandment: Refrain from plugging them in to check them out, because remember: *Thou shalt not kill.*

Veni's Fifth commandment: if your coffee had milk + sugar, you might be screwed. Consider disassembling the affected cups, and if you see congealed dry coffee on the inside, either [1] close everything up and pray to God you can get a warranty swap, or [2] try to wipe off the residue with a moist paper towel. Be very careful on the drivers!

Veni's Sixth commandment: if you like your coffee black,  maybe your best option is to let it dry out. Leave your hedphones somewhere dry for a week or so, and then cautiously plug them in and listen. If they sound like crap, see Commandment #5, Paragraph 1, Subsection 1.

5808,"I think you mean ""mastered"", not ""produced""

Quality for classical recordings is very hit-or-miss.  Although I suppose we should be thankful that classical, in general, has not been affected by compression-itis as much as the rest of today's music has.

One problem with ""good"" classical is that recordings typically never sound as good as live performances in a concert hall with good acoustics. So many of us who are fortunate enough to be able to regularly attend live classical concerts (buying a season ticket to the local symphony is the best thing you can do for yourself if you are a classical fan!) are typically jaded about the quality of classical recordings.

More than just the sound quality, usually when i am after classical recordings I go after specific recordings - composer, orchestra, conductor and soloists are paramount, the actual quality of the recording is secondary to the specific performance I want.

But some labels, like Telarc and Reference Recordings consistently put out great quality.

Also, the really sought-after classical recordings are almost always vintage, and you know that the actual sound quality of those recordings was, by and large, crap. But there are some labels, like Mercury living Presence, which are surprisingly good.

The reason the 414s sold so well was because thanks to the design their sound profile was much more natural than the competition. There was a huge hype train in audiophile circles after they were introduced, and unlike most hype trains you see today, they actually lived up to their reputation.

Plus the 414s looked [radically different](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/global_images/image/file/683/HD414InUse_220px.jpg) when compared to their [competition at the time] (http://www.lemodalogue.fr/images/koss-pro-4aa1.jpg).

5844,"&gt;the bass feels a bit overpowering at times

that's par for the course for the M50X. Unfortunately EQ won't solve your problems because dialing down the bass just makes everything muddier and cutoffs more obvious.

A couple of suggestions:

first, consider swapping the stock pads for DT250 velour pads. The velour will rob some bass, which is all good. Sure 940 pads are another option, but the fit is a little loose 

second, before you throw good money in after bad, consider an alternative -- dump the M50 and get somethinag else.

I would check out the HD518/558 at Best Buy and the DT770 at Guitar Center, auditioning them will help you identify what sound profile best suits your tastes and so you won't get burned again.

The ""DD100"" referenced by the seller isn't the model number of the headphones, they are the model of the Budokan branded walkman, which when it came out in the 80s was innovative because it was one of the first to have a bass boost.

AFAIK the Budokan branded headphones weren't sold separately (I might be mistaken, and if so someone will surely let me know), so as a collectors item without the walkman unit they probably aren't very valuable.

They are supposed to be bass heavy and in conjunction with the bass boost on the walkman, genuine bass cannons (which was unusual for the 80s, when most headphones favored a brighter sound profile than today's Beats dominated market).

I have no idea if the ones you want to buy are genuine or fake, but if memory serves me right the pictures of the Budokan DD100 I have seen did have the ridiculous disclaimers on the headband (""don't wear them when riding a bike!"") and Japanese lettering on the cups. I don't speak japanese, so can't tell you if those letters stand for ""Budokan"" or ""Silly American is fooled by another fake pair of headphones""

If I had to guess, I would be surprised if they were fake, though. These don't really have intrinsic collector's value, and in the 80s cheap japanese headphones were the equivalent of what cheap Chinese headphones are today, so it seems unlikely that someone would go to all that effort to try and fake + age these.

I wish I could be hoptimistic, but alas, I am pretty sure that the cable is now living on burrowed time.


Here is my suggestion (and it is as good as gold -- 24 carrot gold, to be precise):  My guess is that even if the headphones are within the ~~warranty~~ ***warren-ty*** period, Sony customer service won't accept Little Bunny Fufu as an acceptable reason to honor the warranty. But it doesn't hurt to ask, and they can also quote you a price for repair. Sony USA CS number is 1-877-865-7669

My guess is that factoring in the cost of shipping repair may cost you as much if not more than what you paid for the ZX110Cs. And so alternatively, if the damage is towards the termination of the cable, you may be able to chop it off proximal to the carnage and solder in a new jack. Otherwise you may want to cut your losses and get something new.

You may also want to extract revenge from the little leporid, given the heartache that it has caused. I suggest [this](http://www.food.com/recipe/rabbit-stew-249433), and maybe even [this](http://wp.patheos.com/community/bibleandculture/files/2011/01/rabbits-foot.jpg) to protect your next pair of headphones.

My suggestion: it won't harm you to contact Senn CS and see what repairing it costs. If it costs more than, say 50% of the cost of a replacement, I would just cut my losses, dump the damaged IEMs and get a new pair.

Of course, that 50% margin is a purely arbitrary number. Some people are more sentimental about their portable gear, and so are willing to ""shell"" out more to fix broken stuff.

Basically Purrin noted that the mstage input/voltage gain wasn't class A (although the output stage was).

In theory  this minimizes heat differentials  and reduces crossover distortion, so the amp works more efficiently. It's relatively easy to do -- soldering resistors onto an opamp socket.

3. Learn to differentiate hype from fact - for example, you don't really need to buy only matched pairs of tubes for the Crack, and you don't need to pay a premium for cryo-treated tubes.

5923,"&gt;Not so good for acoustic folk, I take it? 

only if they are masochists

&gt;What didn't you like about the SZ1000?

First, the SZ1000 and 2000 achieve their bass by implementing a Kelton design that uses a resonance duct very effectively and by channeling the helmholtz resonances that the duct sets up to deliver more low-end.

second, the design also features a unique (at least to me) dual bass reflex model where the 2nd chamber acts as a passive filter for the mids and highs.

Now this results in awesome bass, but also a ton of undesirable low-end vibrations. JVC gets rid of the vibrations by using a damping cylinder in the design. The SZ2000 damping cylinder is made of brass, is heavy and rigid and does a great job, but JVC cut costs in the SZ1000 by deliberately not choosing to use a metal cylinder but instead a ""filler"" attached to the cylinder bass. 

As a consequence, the SZ1000 low end literally shakes around more than than the 2K, which gets fatiguing quickly. Also the way the SZ1000 damping is implemented robs some of the low-mids, which makes bass-to mid transition sound awkward and choppy.

For someone who hasn't heard the SZ2000, the SZ1000 is surely a bass monster but if you have heard both and you are a basshead there is no way you would prefer the SZ1K to the 2K.

Or to put it differently: I have heard both. And I own the SZ2000 but not the 1000. Nuff said.",2015-07-11 01:27:41+00:00,csza8o9,8.0,t1_csz9jzv,1291.0,headphones

Yes, absolutely. The sound profile between the two is very different (the on ear Soundtrue  is polite and recessed-sounding across the spectrum, the M50x has much more prominent bass.) Since the M50 is closed, around-ear and has a lot of clamping force, it is also much more isolating than the on ear Soundtrues.

5940,"

The problem with the premium audio market is that [1] it is niche and [2] the folks who buy your products jump on and off hype trains with the ease of seasoned commuters.

In the case of the EL8, the same folks that built up the velocity of the hype train to ludicrous speed jumped off all at once after it was launched. Needless to say, the train derailed.

It's not really the fault of the EL8. What *could* have been a revolutionary new design (in collaboration with no less than BMW, jawohl) became embroiled in a plethora of buzzwords (fazor, flexor, uniforce) and poor attention to detail (choice of build materials, loose connectors), not to mention [break-ins] (https://www.facebook.com/AudezeLLC/posts/10152554032352132), and [resignations] (https://www.facebook.com/612646287/posts/10153017701881288/) as everyone and their grandmothers expressed their outrage on the Other Site (some of those posts were so outraged you couldn't tell if folks were ranting about Audeze or Bernie Madoff).

But before we descend into an orgy of schadenfreude, let's put the EL8 into perspective:

It's an attempt by Audeze to produce an ""affordable"" lifestyle headphone. The target audience IMO is non-audiophile folks who have enough disposable income to buy Beats but more common sense than the average Beats owner. Plus the EL8 is targeted at planar wannabes - those that want a piece of the Audeze sound but lack wallets deep enough to afford a LCD2 or LCDX. Plus it demonstrates that the engineers are forward-thinking: the connector design is interesting and unique and will ensure that the EL8 will remain compatible with the next new flavor of the month in audiolalaland - external DSP, proprietary lightning headphone connectors, etc.

It was also an opportunity IMO for Audeze to collaborate with a reputable design studio and  bring out a product that had aesthetic value in addition to audio value. They could also test some new technologies without dirtying the LCD brand (I'm sure they didn't want another fazor controversy on their hands).

Plus if that meant more profits because of proprietary cables, then even better, right?

IMO if they had executed the plan flawlessly, it would have been a win. Certainly the hype was strong enough before launch. 

Unfortunately, folks were expecting a mini-LCD3 at a third of the price, and instead what they got was a headphone where costs were kept down in an obvious way - after Hifiman's veneergate, you would think Audeze would have learned something - IMO just a simple aluminum ring for the EL8 would have been a much better choice than the faux wood. And getting their suppliers to build cables that had connectors manufactured to the right tolerances would have helped. 

But it was too late, and despite the affiliation with BMW DesignWorks,  the EL8 brand was torpedoed by the U-boat of public opinion at launch.

But wait, I hear you say, *you have written a post almost as long as nwavguy and haven't even begun to talk about the sound. What's up with that?*

And that brings me to the saddest part of the EL8 story. Both the open and closed versions are perfectly competent sounding in their own, if somewhat dark way, but at their price point ($700) they are simply not worth it for two reasons [1] the competition delivers more engaging sound for a lower price, no matter *what* sound profile you like, and [2] my modded T50 sounds better than the closed EL8. Now I agree that ""better"" in this case is entirely subjective, but when you are A/Bing a $100 pair of slap-it-together-DIY-style headphones and a $700 pair of precision German-engineered goodness and end up finishing up the listening session with the T50 rather than the EL8, you know that it leaves not just the listener but *everyone* disappointed -- well maybe everyone except Fostex :-)
 
tl;dr: the EL8 story should be a lesson for every small company that depends predominantly on a single forum for a vast majority of their marketing.

Also some audio software/ driver may automatically assign a different gain level to the headphone jack (to protect your hearing) and so your brain may hear the louder output as ""better"" or ""worse"" (usually the former)

5950,"I wouldn't say that neutral headphones necessarily have a lack of bass. Or that ""good"" bass equates to warm sound.

Neutral does not mean anemic bass. You could argue that a relatively neutral pair of headphones like the HD600 has adequate bass which is well proportioned to the rest of the sound spectrum. And the HD800 has relatively flat bass but superb extension and bass detail.

Similarly, I define warmth as a sound profile where the frequency response is tilted clockwise across the range. Yes this implies that as the frequency increases the output of the headphones will decrease, but output alone does not characterize whether bass is ""good"" or ""bad"". For example, the Vmoda Crossfade LP has a warm profile with excessive bass output. If you look only at bass output, you could say that it has ""good"" bass. But in reality the LP bass is muddy, bloated, in sum, crap.

5959,"You know, if someone gave me $1 every time a subjective poorly designed experiment masquerading as objective A/B was highlighted as scientific fact, I would have enough money to buy me an Orpheus. And if you add $1 for every crazy magical-thinking piece of audiophile bullshittery out there, I could buy me ***two*** Orpheuses (Orpheii?). One for each ear.

So let's break this particular test down for what it is

[1] its basically not an experiment at all but an opinion because the author shares no real data

[2]  the 7506 doesn't allow enough separation and detail to actually figure out subtle nuances

[3] the sample size tested (snippets of 3 songs) is too small -- keep in mind that the quality of songs you hear on streaming services is entirely dependent not only on the encoding applied by the streaming service but also on the original masters that the streaming service got from the record companies

[4] Just setting services to maximum bitrate isn't enough. Unless the 3 snippets were volume matched, a majority of listeners will pick the loudest sample as the best-sounding sample

So what's good about it?

[1] the iphone 6 plus actually has pretty decent audio

[2] audiophiles obsess about minute subtle nuances in sound quality. A vast majority of humanity do not. For them, this is a good ""man on the street"" article that quickly lets them decide if they want to spend more $$$ on an ""audiophile"" streaming service or not.

[3] many people reading the verge don't even know that audiophile services liker Tidal exist. For them, it's an opportunity to break free from the yoke of iTunes tyranny

[4] The test simulates real world, as opposed to critical listening settings. Think about it -- when you are on the go, and streaming spotify from your phone when you are sitting on the bus with traffic noise and the baby screaming behind you and the woman in the seat next to you talking very loudly on the phone about her recent diagnosis of herpes, do you really care if you can hear Wayne Shorter breathing during the sax solo in *Aja*?

IMO the MA750is have decent bass for hip hop, so it may also be that your expectations for bass were more than what the MA750 can deliver.

I would probably get a pair of JVC HAFX101s before playing IEM musical chairs looking for bass, though. The 101s are super cheap and will give you a good sense of how much bass you can expect from entry level IEMs. It will also help you decide how much bass you are willing to sacrifice for clarity (like you would with the MA750s) or for euphonic mids (like you would if you got the SE215), and so you will be in a better position to judge what sound profile you prefer and how you want to evolve as an audiophile listener who likes their hip hop.

If you are looking for an OTL tube amp that pairs excellently with headphones like the HD600 or 650, allows you to tube roll without breaking the bank, and conceivably could go head-to-head with OTLs that cost 3x as much (I'm looking at you, WA2), then IMO the crack is a great choice.

Some caveats.

If you cannot DIY, then this is not for you (unless you can get someone to build it for you). Even though this is a relatively simple DIY project, to does involve some degree of technical proficiency.

So what to do if you want a Crack but don't want to DIY one? If you live in a reasonably large metropolitan area, here's my suggestion: go the engineering or computer science department of your local university and put up a notice on a bulletin board that you require the services of a mercenary soldersmith. I will bet you an upvote that someone will be interested enough to take you up on the offer.

If this is your first time DIYing, please do take sensible precautions because, well, voltages. Make sure you budget for a decent soldering iron (because you know you will always want more after the first time you do it)  and a multimeter. 

I would suggest that you build the crack in 2 stages: first the regular crack, and then after you have listened to it for a few weeks, the speedball upgrade. This way you will know exactly what speedball brought to the party.

If you are looking for gooey warm euphonic tube sound, my advice is that you *don't* upgrade to the speedball. It pushes the crack towards neutrality rather than emphasize its tubey goodness.

The Crack is also not a great pairing with planars or IEMs.

And finally check out [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5rWCEux_BI) if you are on the fence so that you can get a sense of what it takes to build a crack, because IMO if the dude making this video can build a crack, then heck, so can you.",2015-07-05 17:38:31+00:00,cssz17z,1.0,t3_3c7gn0,3990.0,headphones

Well, IMO when it comes to upgrading from the M50s, [the only way is up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AewNd29wRUM), so you should expect good times and happy tunes.

&gt;What will the difference in sound signature be like? 

I will confidently predict this: if you approach the X2 with an open mind and very little bias, and give your ears and brain some time to get used to them before pronouncing judgement on them, then  you will be pleasantly surprised. But if you are expecting every prophecy uttered by the X2 hype train to come true, then alas, your expectations are likely to be dashed.

&gt;Should I expect them to be more natural or less fatiguing?

""more natural"" and ""less fatiguing"" are not necessarily mutually exclusive. While I wouldn't characterize either the X2 or the M50 as entirely ""natural"", the X2 is certainly leans more towards natural than the M50

If I may make a suggestion, OP: when you unbox the X2s, set aside the M50s for a week or two. Resist the temptation to do an A/B on day 1, no matter how powerful the urge.

6000,"Since the Fiio model numbers can be confusing, here are the most obvious differences between various Fiio models. I'm sure folks will add to what I have missed and correct me if I am mistaken.

****

I'm going to call this ""***Veni's PSA on the differences between Fiio models, which were hard enough to tell apart when they were named after mountains but now are more ""Confusing"" than ""Confucius""***

****

E7 / E9 /E17 = older models, while E07K / E09K / E17K = newer models

E9 is only compatible with older E7, and E09K only compatible with E07K/ E17.  

Note that the E09K is ***not*** compatible with the E17K even though they both have a ""K"" at the end.

Major differences between E7 and E07K: E7 could handle only 16 bit /48k, E07K can manage 24/96 input, has a line out bypass filter, and cosmetic styling differences.

Major differences between the E17 and E17K: E17K has a new USB chip (the SA9027) so handles 32/96 + DSD (via ASIO). The E17K DAC is also different (PCM5102), as is the opamp. The E17K also has a OPA1622 as a low-pass filter. The E17K no longer has the mini-Toslink optical out jack. Instead, in addition to the coax in (which the E17 also has), the E17K  has built in line in / out.

The interface is different, instead of the column of buttons on the right that the E17 had, the E17K has a more minimalistic button layout (just 2) and a scroll wheel. The E17K display features larger, more readable text.

But I would be surprised if  you can reliably tell the difference between the two if you blind-tested them.

6003,"Ah, the E17. With all the options available today the E17 may sound very meh, but when it was released it was probably the best portable DAC/amp you could get from a price-performance perspective. 

The E17 and E17K are a little long in the tooth now, but IMO they are still great choices for entry level gear (especially if you can find them used for cheap), with a few caveats.

First, the build quality. In a word, excellent. [Here is mine after years of significant abuse] (http://i.imgur.com/ZCRjfdu.jpg) stuffing it into pockets and throwing it into backpacks and , and as you can see, it still looks pretty good considering it could probably sue me for causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

In addition to the OLED screen and long-lived rechargeable battery, the E17 has some other features you would not expect from gear at its price point, for example an optical in mini-Toslink jack, line out, a built in EQ, very low output impedance + a barely audible noise floor (which made it a great choice for IEMs) and the ability to plug into the E09K in a modular fashion to deliver a portable + desktop solution.


The E17 has a WM8740 DAC chip which has been around for a while and has been used in some mid-fi DACs like the Cambridge DacMagic and PMPs like the Fiio X3, Xuelin ihifi960, etc. Even companies like Rega have used the WM8740, for example in their Apollo and Saturn CD players. It has a characteristic warm sound, so if you are looking for a neutral dac/amp that ""gets out of the way"", then the E17 is not for you.

In addition to its primary use as a portabler single-unit DAC/a,p. you can also use the E17 as a DAC when plugged into the E09K, or using the  [Fiio L7] (http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Line-Out-Dock-Cable/dp/B004QVNS0S) which connects to the E17 and to line in / USB. When using the L7, there is a LO BYPASS slider on the side of the E17 which when selected bypasses the onboard amp on the E17 and allows it to output as DAC only. So in this configuration you would connect USB in and LO 3.5mm to the L7 instead of the E17 and use the E17 as a dac. You could also do optical in to E17 and use the L7 3.5mm LO to your amp, and use the USB in of the L7 only to charge the E17. The E17 can charge when mated with the L7.

The E17 will power most entry level and mid fi headphones, though it struggles with high impedance models, and isn't a great pairing with planars.

And now to some cons.

First, the OLED screen has a tendency to burn in if left on all the time. 

Second, IMO the E17 had a defective charging circuit; if you left it plugged into a USB power source for extended periods of time there was a decent chance you would fry the battery (which isn't replaceable). 

Third, considering that the E17 is solidly built, the L7 is built cheaply from plastic and feels like it would break if exposed to a light breeze. Plus once you mate the L7 + E17 you want to figure out a way to keep it from moving since if it slides around you may end up damaging the E17 LO port.

Fourth, I have read about an issue with the USB chip failing in some E17s on the other site. 

Fifth, the buttons are fiddly and the display interface is, well, crap.

Sixth, folks uniformly seem to have issues with Fiio customer support.

And finally, while the E17 might be great value, when you consider the E17 and E09K together for desktop use, well the combo no longer makes sense from a price-performance perspective because competitors like the Audio gd NFB15, or even the Monoprice desktop Amp.

Asp handles better, but you are not going to make a bunch of tight turns while exploring, so that isn't a game changer either.

The only major advantage of the Asp IMO is that you can load up more slots, so you don't have to compromise with choices like an extra fuel tank or a cargo bay or additional AFM units.

I usually explore with an Asp but  switched to a DBE for my last trip and it was fun. I'll probably end up using the Asp mainly to do rare trades and keep the DBE as my daily driver for exploring.

6025,"Golden rule of buying Beyerdynamics = never pay MSRP

This price is about par for the T90 when it is on sale (which is often)

IMO the T90 are much maligned and actually not a bad value from a price performance perspective.

So are they really the treble cannons they are made out to be?

Well, *all* the Beyer top-of-the-range headphones have treble prominence, whether you look at the T70, the T90, or the T1. There's this insidious rise in the high end that starts at about 5000 Hz and quickly spikes up to a peak at around 9000 Hz - it is IMO a reflection of the Beyer driver designs and no amount of damping or attenuation or pad mods or toilet paper can get rid of it. 

Of the 3, the T90 peaks the earliest, and because the area under the curve is the greatest of the three, the T90 also has the most prominent and perceptible treble. Which i why it gets the reputation that it does. 

If you want to choose a TOTL Beyer with the least treble prominence, the T1 is probably your best bet. But even those have obvious ""hot"" treble for someone coming from, say a HD650.

But there is a silver lining to this bright cloud: since the T90 treble ramps up all the way from the high mids in a predictable and escalating manner, you get brightness without the jangly treble disconnect you get with the HD700. 

Also, you don't get the sibilance that you do with the HE400. So it's not as fatiguing during extended listening sessions.

The treble does get considerably less prominent if you pair the T70 with a warm amp, but then IMO if that's the direction you want to go, then why not just get a more neutral pair of headphones instead?

So who is the T90 for? Obviously if you are older, and have a little high frequency hearing loss, you may love the T90 because it lets you hear high-end nuances that many other headphones cannot.

Also if you own a Grado and like it, you owe it to yourself to check out the T70/90/T1, because there is a reasonably good chance you will like how they sound.

And if you like natural brightness, the T90 is a great option, because typically it is less expensive than a T1. 

But then the T70 usually runs cheaper than the T90, and in that case they might be the best value of the 3 from a price-performance perspective. 

Except when the T90 (or the T1) are one sale, because those discounts can be almost as steep as the Beyer treble curve :-)",2015-07-01 17:26:24+00:00,csow2ap,1.0,t3_3bqevm,31213.0,headphones
6026,"&gt; I agree that this is a bit of an odd move

I'm not sure it's all that odd of a move. Considering that AKG is owned by Harman, this is not too surprising IMO.

First, AKG haven't done well in the TOTL wars, compared to the competition

Second, there's a growing sense that the next new thing in headphones is personalization --  headphones that allow consumers to shape sound profiles using built-in EQ/virtualization, offer ANC to combat external noise, and sport a ""premium"" look + feel of materials.

Third, there's also a growing realization from a business + sales perspective that headphone manufacturers need to think about designing headphones with onboard DACs, for when Apple gets rid of the analog headphone jack (and they will!).

And finally, unfortunately the general perception of AKG right now is that of a company desperately outsourcing everything they make to save money during manufacturing. IMO this is AKG's attempt to create a ""halo"" headphone that positions them as innovators. The N90Q positions AKG once again as a ""premium"" brand.

I disagree with /u/Rashkh that AKG is going after the Ultrasone Edition 10.  IMO everyone who knows something about Ultrasone understands that they march to the beat of a different drum than the rest of the industry.

We had been chatting about how everyone on the other site said the Ms1 sounded better than a Sr80i, and he knew I was interested in hearing them for myself, but also that I  was too cheap to buy them for myself.

I didn't have an SR80i at the time, but I did have an SR60i and since I couldn't hear any difference between the 60 and the 80 I thought why not A/B the 60i  and the MS1 instead. Surely the MS1 will blow the 60 out of the water like everyone says, and then I can  convince my buddy to agree to swap the MS1  for the SR60 and maybe throw in a video game or two, or an half-empty bottle of scotch -- it seemed fair at the time, mostly because of why the bottle was almost empty :-)

Well I couldn't hear much of a difference between the MS1 and the SR60i, and neither could my buddy (his opinion was and continues to be useless, because he is a speakers kinda guy -- dude if you are reading this [1] yes you know who you are and [2] you know its true!)

I convinced myself that the MS1 treble was a little smoother  (maybe it was because a good single malt makes the *entire universe* smoother) but otherwise I was convinced that the MS1 was just a rebadged SR60i (I'm convinced the SR80i is a rebadged SR60i too, unless you can explain to me what ""destressed drivers"" means in a convincing way, because that is the only difference between the 60i and the 80i).

6046,"&gt; I'm gonna just assume its i my head though.

When I bought my X1, I bought a mediabridge cable at the same time because [1] the stock cable was too long, and [2] there was intense hype on headfi about how much of a night-and-day difference there was with a cable swap.

I wasn't really expecting to hear a difference, but there was one. It wasn't a night-and-day difference like the hypetrain said, for sure, but the bass got tighter and the clarity improved.

I initially assumed I was part of a mass hysteria phenomenon and it was all in my head, but in reality it was because the X1 cable was truly crap.

So when I got my hands on an X2, one of my first experiments was to swap the X2 cable out for the trusty mediabridge cable, if only to prove that Philips had fixed the problem, because, well, there was  massive hype online that they had.

Imagine my surprise when I thought I heard a difference with the cable swap. ""*What sorcery is this?*"" I said, and assumed I was hallucinating.

But having played around with the X2 cable for a while on other headphones, I have come to the conclusion that the X2 cable is, well, crap.

They also owned a couple of subsidiary brand names, like Herald Electronics from Chicago, IL.

In addition to Olson branded product their stores also sold other brands like Garrard and Teledyne. Interestingly it was Teledyne that cut into their market share and more than anyone else killed them off.

It's funny you mention the WA2 + T1 pairing, for a while most folks (like me) said that the WA2 was wasted on the T1, and then someone on headfi (I think it was Skylab) said that the WA2 + t1 combo was their favorite pairing, and then then next thing you know everyone started having orgasms about the combo. 

I have heard the WA2 with the T1 for a reasonably extended period of time, it is not a pairing that I would recommend. Why? Two reasons. First, the warmth generated by the WA2 is wasted on the T1. Second, typically tubes smear treble, and the T1 amplifies this in a way that often detracts from the music.  If you want a warm amp to complement the T1, IMO go solid state. If you *must* go tube, then IMO the Vally is actually not a bad choice --  tube amps that are relatively more neutral are a better choice than warm tube amps to pair with the T1, for sure.

****

Rule 2: Not all tube amps have gooey tube euphonic sound (e.g. the Valhalla2, Torpedo)

Corollary 2: But many do (Crack, WA2)

****


Rule 3: Some headphones just aren't made for tube amps (e.g. the Beyer T1, many IEMs)

Corollary ~~4~~ 3: But some are (e.g. the HD650)

****

Veni's bonus Tube Rule: Tube rolling can be expensive, sometimes more expensive than the amps themselves, so do your research before you jump into tube amps!

6166,"Ultrasone is an interesting headphone manufacturer, mainly because their headphones are more polarizing than those of any other manufacturer, and for one and only one reason -- S-logic. 

S-logic is based on [this paper] (http://www.hifisentralen.no/forumet/attachments/hodetelefoner/141165d1339660581-ultrasone-edition-og-signature-116aes_pager.pdf) that Florian Konig, the founder of Ultrasone, wrote. 

I read it when I first tried to figure out what the term ""S-logic"" meant, and I think it is the best (and probably only) detailed explanation you are ever going to get on the topic, unless you count the bullshit on the Ultrasone website. The problem is that the paper is translated into English in such a clumsy way (I assume that it was not initially written by an English speaker) that many of the concepts are almost impossible to understand. It's like the paper was written by a Tamarian (""*Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra, Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel*""). If you don't understand what I mean by this, well, you probably never will, it's a Star Trek thing :-)

Basically, as far as I can make out (disclaimer: it's been a while since I have thought about this in detail because it gives me a migraine) the sound gets better if you place the drivers in a ""decentric"" fashion  (i.e. in an inhumanly low position and angled weirdly) then something called ""head-related transfer"" occurs  and then the sound that travels through regular air conduction (via the drivers) and head-related transfer function are both picked up the brain and combined to create a magical 3D sound. You with me? Good, because I'm not sure I am.

Now to be fair, other headphones like the  Senn HD800 also utilizes a somewhat eccentric driver placement, and many IEMs add a component of bone conduction, and Ultrasone has a ton of patents for S-logic, and Florian Konig is clearly a very smart man, and his paper offers a reasonable scientific hypothesis to support decentral driver placement, so maybe there is something to it. Rather than depend on my biased opinion, read the paper for yourself and decide!

Suffice to say that depending on your perspective, S-Logic technology either improves the sound like the Traveler (whose name was unpronounceable by Humans) improved the warp drive of the USS Enterprise, or kills the sound more thoroughly than a Klingon warrior with a bat'leth.

I am of the latter persuasion. IMO the drivers of every Ultrasone model are positioned weirdly, somewhere waaay below where my ears are, and I have normal size ears positioned where normal humans grow ears (I can confidently say that if you were Abe Sapien from ""Hellboy"" any Ultrasone would fit you just right). And even if it did fit (or probably because it did not), the S-logic just makes everything sound so weird. It just plain sounds wrong.

And to be fair, I should add that Ultrasone claims that their headphones subject you to less EM radiation than other headphones, and that you are less likely to sustain hearing loss with their headphones.

However, when you start spending more on pads than you did on the headphones, you have to ask - in the long term would it make more sense to just bank the $ and save up towards upgrading the whole headphones and not just the pads?  

Having said this, if it is purely a comfort issue then imo Dt250 pads are exponentially more comfortable than the stock monoprice pads.

 But if the stock pads are uncomfortable because your ears are too big for the ipening or stick out too much and make contact with the driver, then changing to the Dt250 pads may not help that much because they are not *that* much bigger or roomier than stock.
