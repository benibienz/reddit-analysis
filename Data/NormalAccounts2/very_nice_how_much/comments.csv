I was asking because of this: 

Can a bar or restaurant mail drink coupons to customers? For example, ""Bring this postcard in for two complimentary drinks""? 

No, the holder of a manufacturing, wholesale, or retail level license or permit may not give any rebate or coupon redeemable by the public for the purchase of or for a discount on the purchase of any alcoholic beverage. A retailer may give one complimentary beverage to an individual consumer during the course of one business day but may not do so by redeemable drink ticket or coupon.

The position of the shoulders is so completely different, and to think the exact same mechanics would be in place for each lift is a little short sighted.

I agree it shouldn't be a press out like a lot of heavy muscle snatches tend to be, but there will be some mechanical differences between the two movements.

I know what it's like to have an idea and not be 100% sure about how to get it to come to fruition. I'm a non-technical founder and I have been able to secure funding and get the ball rolling on development for my app.

Here's what I would recommend to get out of thinking and into doing:

1. Get everything down on paper; how you visualize the UI, the flow of the app itself, rough logos, names, a business plan...literally anything that will help you shape the platform into what your vision is.

2. Talk with an expert. Find someone you trust and schedule a chat over coffee. Since you're in college see if there is a comp sci professor or TA that is willing to meet. Find out what they think the complexity of your platform is and see what they recommend for development.

3. Find a technical co-founder. If your idea has merit this shouldn't be too hard to do. When you do #2 (hehe) be sure to find out what languages they recommend for the front and back end development and find someone who is versed in one or all of them. I would try to keep it local - friends of friends, other students, etc. and make sure to have a contract in place for the working relationship.

Aside from that are there any local video production companies that would help record an interview of the vets and put together a short piece for you?

It would be a great way for them to gain exposure. You could even talk to college students for this or go to a professor that teaches production at the local universities.

With the scalability of marketing on social media I would love for that as a primary channel and consider one off events as supplemental. All it takes is one video to catch on and you can sell more copies than you'd imagine.

8.01
Legal pitching delivery. 

There are two legal pitching positions, the Windup Position and the Set Position, and either position may be used at any time.
Pitchers shall take signs from the catcher while standing on the rubber.
Rule 8.01 Comment: Pitchers may disengage the rubber after taking their signs but may not step quickly onto the rubber and pitch. This may be judged a quick pitch by the umpire. When the pitcher disengages the rubber, he must drop his hands to his sides.
Pitchers will not be allowed to disengage the rubber after taking each sign.
(a) The Windup Position. The pitcher shall stand facing the batter, his pivot foot in contact with the pitchers plate and the other foot free. **From this position any natural movement associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without interruption or alteration. He shall not raise either foot from the ground, except that in his actual delivery of the ball to the batter**, he may take one step backward, and one step forward with his free foot.",2016-04-20 12:54:25+00:00,d2a8bwu,1.0,t3_4fmabu,18168.0,mlb

276,"Fair enough.

My humble opinion would be: it depends. 

If ankle or hip mobility is the limiting factor of how low you're getting when you squat then any variation wouldn't have a ton of impact on knee health (assuming that your knees tracked properly in each version).

If you're really getting ATG and your knee flexion is the, or one of the, inhibiting factors of going lower I definitely think it would have an impact. A lot of heavy benchers get shoulder impingement or even SLAP Lesions from bouncing when they bench press as opposed to using a strict movement.

With squats it would be largely the same because a) it is a more controlled movement that doesn't require a reflex to change the direction of the weight, b) by removing the bounce you're effectively reducing the range of motion to what your body naturally supports, and c)most people pause squat less than they regular HBBS so there's inherently less stress on your body.

Chances of pulling it off - 1:25

Chances of it earning you a job at an agency - 1:10

___

That means there needs to be a potential payout of 2.5:1 for the app in its own right for you to go with it. (1:10 divided by 1:25).

If the job you're looking for pays 75k a year then that would mean the top potential for the app would have to be just over 180k a year (not that much for a successful app). 

The value of a patent alone can outweigh that if it's in the right industry. I personally have an app that is about to launch and it's liberating; win, lose, or draw I've learned so much and having the experience on my CV is a huge asset. 

Biased opinion - go for it. Don't let the potential of failure deter you from potentially succeeding. If you can pull it off your life will be completely different, and if you don't it sucks but you'll be better for it.

2. Just because it solves a problem does not mean that everyone will want to use it. There is a ton of red tape at most nonprofits. It can be in the form of multiple departments that have to come together for a decision to be made, or it can be board approval for a new vendor. It rarely is a cut and dry decision and nonprofits don't want to do *anything* to put their donating supporters at risk.    Along those lines, I thought I would be able to come in and work with every nonprofit right off the bat; in the beginning most of my partners (prelaunch) were PTAs and booster clubs.

3. We have two parts to our business model so we are working through a chicken/egg dilemma right now. It's not halted but it is definitely taking more time than we anticipated to grow our network. Also #2's answers are relevant here too.

Internet Weightlifting Coach checking in - I would work on driving your knees back when the bar is at your knee so you can recruit more of your hamstrings and butt into the lift.

If you look at ~:22 in the video (the bottom position of the bar) your knees are pretty far forward. If you can cover the bar here you'll get a lot more of your muscles in the mix for the rest of the lift.

The good news is that you pull the bar just about to shoulder height so it looks like you have a lot more left in the tank.

Closers normally rely a lot more on their arms to throw the ball than a starter. This allows them to muscle it up there (more velocity, less accuracy) since they're going to max out around 20 pitches. When you ask someone to throw like that 100 times a night that's where you start seeing the arm issues because it's not a process that the body can handle repeating that many times.

You can't say that they wouldn't have gotten hurt if they stayed as closers but most people in the know agree that the transition from short relief to starter is very tough on the arm.",2015-12-03 15:46:05+00:00,cxlq9r8,5.0,t1_cxlpztt,434.0,TexasRangers

513,"It sucks when they wiggle about price. I've had luck saying that in order to get a custom budget approved I have to confirm some things with you first, and one of these is your budget for this purchase.

Aside from that, when a client asks for a discount always ask what it would take for them to move forward and confirm that if you get that price they'll be ready to go. That way if/when you get it approved you can reach out to them with the ""good news"" call and ideally get the contract eSigned with them on the phone.

Sometimes they won't know a number and that's fine. Have them ask their uppers what they need and you'll get more buy in. It mentally preps them to sign. 

In the event that they throw out a ridiculous number don't be afraid to say that you can't take that to your finance department and ask if there's any way ______ would work (_____ = you suggesting a more reasonable number). They'll probably have to go back and ask again but the first number was something they most likely made up out of thin air anyway.

You never want to get into a price debate so be sure to confirm the value while you do this and if you have any case studies of similar clients be sure to cite the savings or increase in productivity they saw when they came on board as your client.

The last thing would always be to set an appointment for the next step; even if it's just a 5 minute call to answer a question or to give information that they requested.

Leave them alone for now. I would send an email with a piece of relevant collateral on Thursday or Friday at the earliest and follow up that afternoon with a call.

It sucks but it's not over. You need to take control back and you can do that by making them give you a price they would move forward with to reopen the dialogue.

Once you're familiar with the tools at your disposal start following people on YouTube that make music that you like and watch how they build things syntax wise.

I started by watching, then I started listening to and building songs that I liked. They took forever and were shit(tier) at first, but it helped me learn how to build sounds and music in Ableton.

Once you get comfortable with that start taking the training wheels off.

One thing I will say is that I went a little crazy with VSTs and sound packs too early. It's not as flashy, but use the stock tools to build some simple 4/4 music at first. If you want a different sound use the Audio Effects that you have available.

I have been going through things like Codecademy, Rails for Zombies, and I just got Michael Hartl's *Rails Tutorial* from Amazon and I've started to cut my way through that.

I guess my stance is that I'm only learning based on my comprehension of what's being presented. Even though I'm making my way through these courses I'm still not sure if I'm following best practice or really seeing things from the angle that they're intended to be presented in.

My thought is that having someone their to act kind of like bumpers when kids bowl would help make sure that I'm actually seeing the big picture when I make my way through these rudimentary pieces.

My process is pretty much this; attempt, search Google, clean up initial code, repeat.

721,"I was the only rep for a private equity firm for just about a year, and I was with the company overall for a few years. This was good because it taught me how to prospect, but it was tough at times because if something I tried didn't work the commissions reflected it.

Your TL;DR is a little ironic, because regardless of how you initiate the contact it does take some schmoozing to land the deal. Not necessarily 18 holes at the country club every time, but when it comes to wealth management, or investing in general, people only trust their money with people that they trust.

Initially engaging someone can be tough. Especially in a competitive market like WM. Your background will help with this though so that's good.  Make sure your prospectus is strong; not just with the content, but also its visual appeal. This will entice the person and give you an opportunity to present your services to them.

So getting someone to take a look at it - how hard can it be?

My main outlets were initially cold calling screened accredited investor lists. This was alright, but saturated to say the least.

Once I got away from that I started relying on people who were currently investing with me. I quickly learned that doctors typically invest in groups and for about 4 months the majority of my time was spent engaging current clients (namely doctors) about increasing their investment, and allowing me to present the opportunity to their friends (typically other doctors) that they invest with.

Once they agreed to this I would put on a dinner at a nice restaurant in their area and present the opportunity to them. Sometimes I would bring backup (fund manager, head analyst, or fund president) to help speak on the nuances of the fund.

Not 100% schmoozing, but still something that makes an impact.

Aside from that we had a lot of success at The Money Show. They had 4 stops around the US (Chicago, San Fran, Orlando, and Vegas) and the premise of the conference was a place for accredited investors to find investments. It was expensive, but almost always netted a positive return within 30 days of the end of the show, and over time investors would trickle in and strengthen that return.

Once we got some momentum word of mouth really started carrying some merit and even though the other mediums were still utilized, they were no longer the lifeblood of the business.

738,"No worries. I was going to say - I need to start looking at internships, haha.

Do they have anyone else in the position right now either as an intern or employee? If they do I would ask how much they're closing each month and what their ramp up was like, or in the least do they have projections of what they're expecting sale wise?

The thing about startups is that most of them (speaking in generalities here) don't have great training systems in place so you'll most likely be on your own when it comes to learning (creating) a process for closing business.

I would recommend picking up a copy of *The Challenger Sale* and reading that. It's great for keeping control of the process and staying in a position where the client needs to work through you to make it happen.

When it comes to asking for more if it's an outside position I would try to negotiate a travel expense. If it's inside and you ask for more per sale maybe offer a tier based on what they give you for projections, or a bonus structure if you clear certain milestones.
__________
**Example 1**

- 20 sales per month currently being closed by team members on average

(I don't have a British Pound symbol on my keyboard)

Sales 1-10 = $30

Sales 11-20 = $40

Sales 20+ = $50

If you hit 20 sales a month you would take home $700 and then you would make $50 for everything past that point. 30 sales would net $1200, 40 = $1700, etc.
__________
Or you could ask for a commission based on the amount of the business. 

**Example 2**

- assuming the average sale is $200

Sale Amount

$50 (minimum) - $150 = 20%
80 500 540
$151 - $250 = 25%
 
$251 + = 30%

Using the same 20 sales a month from Example 1 we'll make a guess of 8 sales in the bottom tier averaged at $100, 8 at $200, and 4 at $300.

This would bring home $920, but if you were able to close larger deals, well use 4, 10, and 6 sales at the same avg. price for example, would bring home $1,120. 

You can sell them on the fact that this model will also motivate you to push for more business and larger deals. And what's good for the goose is good for the gander. 

It would be easy to build a spreadsheet showing the different options to support your case. If someone came to me with this proposal and it was my business I wouldn't be able to say no.",2015-08-21 19:20:44+00:00,cub03jk,3.0,t1_cuayxsv,1780.0,sales

Admittedly, at the time I did it I probably wasn't at a point that warranted that intense of a program, but I made it through with the help of a few extra rest days mixed in. 

One thing I will say is that around week 3 or 4 Nine Weeks of Heaven feels like it's too easy; the percentages are relatively low and the volume only intermittently intensifies. Shortly after the program goes into overdrive for the rest of the cycle so let it build as it's written.

The thing I didn't like about it was the lack of 1RM days throughout the nine weeks. I like to get under some heavy weight every 2-3 weeks to at least give it a shot, but this program doesn't offer that.

Let them know you'll pressure wash a dirty wall on a city building (ideally in a high traffic area) for free if you can make art on it first. If the city says no reach out to businesses about doing it pro bono or with a steep discount.

Once someone bites I would go to local media outlets and tell them that you're going to do reverse graffiti in an area to see if they would be interested in writing about it.

I have had a ton of luck finding journalists in my area on LinkedIn and Twitter.

If large outlets aren't interested don't be afraid to go small with bloggers or the like.

Once you get written about use this to promote yourself through social media to connect with people that are interested and potential prospects.

When you're introducing something new into a market your early adapters are key so if anyone does show interest do what you have to to get them on as a client.

The only downside I can see is that once you get a client it may take a while for the wall to dirty up again so you can create something new for them.

Awesome idea though, and good luck! Do you have any pictures of walls you've done before?

756,"I have a company that I'm running and my professional experience is in sales (private equity, and more recently SaaS) and while I largely agree with the article I feel like I might be in a good position to offer some insights from what I've learned.

Much of what I will say is based on the methodology that can be found in The Challenger Sale.

**Sales Negotiation is a Dance**

I absolutely think this is true, but much like dancing, if there isn't a pronounced leader the steps will get off tempo. 

When you're in the position as the sales professional, or more likely in a startup scenario a stakeholder or founder of the business, the client is intrinsically going to look to you to for expertise. 

You convey this by not only proving your expertise in your product or service, but also by controlling the process from start to finish. This doesn't mean that you're militant about it, but it does mean that you dictate the overall direction of the process at all times.

A big part of this is withholding information that the client asks for until the right time. Price is a huge one here, but similar things include specific information before a demo. You have to keep yourself in a position where the client needs you get what they need, and by staying in that spot while regulating the flow of information you keep communication open and the client actively engaged.

**Sales Negotiation Varies According to Culture**

Sure. 

Back to my last point though - stay in control and set the expectations of what needs to happen for the client to work with you. Make the client follow your path and let them control the things that don't matter like meeting times, trivial questions, or syntax of minor events.

**Listen Carefully**

Absolutely, and this is ***the most important part.*** 

Start the sales process by listening. Before you start selling, or even trying to get the client to see why they should consider your product, you have to listen to see why they think there might be a fit. 

This is a Needs Assessment and it's going to give you 100% of the ammunition that you need to eventually will need to close the deal.

Things I cover during a needs assessment

* Their current process that your product or service can replace including what they like about it, what they don't like, what they would change if they could wave a magic wand and fix it, major issues (time spent, resource allocation, inefficiencies)

* Current workflow for that process

* Other technologies or products they have that would interact with your solution, and what that purchasing process looked like (timeline, decision makers involved, who signed the order form, what department paid, etc.)

* Time frame they're looking to purchase within. Also ask about any impending events that they ***need*** a solution in place by

* If this is an allocated budget. If not where will the money come from? Do they think it's available?

**You're Not Going to Sell Now**

Agree 100%. Hold your cards close to your chest. When you do a demo base it completely around your needs assessment and if you give a feature of what you're offering be sure to tie in how it will benefit them. Every. Time.

**Negotiation**

I'm going to cut to the chase for the last few topics. I covered a lot of it above and I'm getting a little bored with this, but I'm in too deep to just stop now.

Don't negotiate on price alone unless it's a volume discount. Respectfully let the client know that you don't play the price game. Don't be snide, but do convey that your product is a value at it's current price point. 

If the discussion comes to this I ***always*** ask if this is truly a price issue or if there's anything else that's stopping them from moving forward. You should be confirming acceptance throughout each stage of the process, but doing it here is especially powerful and the client will almost always be candid with their response.

If they swear up and down that it is 100% based on price, try to work out billing options to make it work without coming off of your original price, and if they still won't budge don't be afraid to walk away.

___________

This might seem like a tough love way to work with clients, but you can be cordial throughout the process and it will work beautifully. 

Start the process by finding out the client's needs, prove yourself as an expert, remain in control of the process, if a client objects at the end isolate the objection(s) with a candid conversation, and revert to value and the client's current pain/fear as a tool to close; most people buy because of fear of loss rather than hope of gain.

If you do these things you'll have a much more predictable sales cycle, and you'll be knocking down deals with regularity in no time.

1. Get my shins vertical
2. Keep my back angle static
3. Cover the bar

The main thing I notice during the movement is that your shins never get vertical so your hamstrings can't get fully engaged (meaning lost power). You're basically doing a hip snatch but you're starting at the floor. 

Once you get the bar moving up (third pull) work on controlling it with your shoulders. The top of your pull is pretty much a hump and a squat which is getting the job done here, but will be tough to scale as the weight gets heavier.

It's hard to tell a lot with the clip being slowed down, but it looks like you have a good foundation to build on. /r/weightlifting has a great community and there's always a lot of constructive feedback on form checks that are posted there.

Covering the bar = keeping your shoulders in front of the bar as long as possible. This loads your glutes/hamstrings and creates a band reflex similar to a scap load in pitching (baseball).

896,"I would say that's true. I'm at a young (7 year old) niche software company so it's not a corporate setting by any means. Most days I wear gym clothes to work and joke around when I'm not speaking with a client.

It looks like you're looking to start a career. Unless you have a skilled degree I would absolutely recommend going into sales. Not just to make a career as a salesman, but to learn how business interacts. No one know more about the war than the infantry and the sales team is the front line of an organization. You'll have an understanding of business that people who graduate and just start pushing paper will lack. The upside is that if it turns out to be something you excel at you can run with it.

My main qualm with sales is that you really are only as good as your last month. I have landed key accounts for my company. I have managed the formation of partnerships with huge players that have netted tons of money for us and at the time I was compensated accordingly, but at the end of the day I still know in the back of my mind that if for some reason I stop closing business I can be replaced. It's barely (maybe rarely is a better word) a symbiotic relationship and no matter how much I have enjoyed the company that I have been with I have never let myself get too comfortable. Maybe that helps drive my success. Who knows.

I don't know if your post and line of questioning was intended to uncover if sales is a good industry to move into but it seems like that may be the case. I would say absolutely, but don't let that automatically relegate you to a career in sales if it doesn't feel right.

I am at a point now where I am starting to transition away from client selling as a staple of my duties, but there's sales in every position under the sun and the past 8 years have prepped me for that.",2015-06-25 02:59:55+00:00,cshue2g,5.0,t1_cshtrp5,1176.0,sales
