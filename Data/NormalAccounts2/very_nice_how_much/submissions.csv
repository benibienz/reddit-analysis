Love the subreddit. I recently got into Borderlands 2 and for the most part I have been loving the experience so far, but while completing Toil and Trouble in TVHM I started dying a ton. So much so I would have put the game down had it been like this earlier. I probably died 30 times in the mission alone.  Terrible, I know.

I am wondering if this was just a tough mission or if it's a warning of what's to come tor the rest of this play through and for UVHM.

Here's why I'm worrried:

1. My weapons *SUCK*. My most reliable gun is a level 36 Crammed Unkempt Harold. Aside from that I have a Jacobs sniper that does about 19k base damage, and a 3 shot launcher that's good for 119k base. My fourth slot rotates, but I have no other legendaries so nothing really works great to fill the spot.

2. I always play solo. Spotty internet paired with no buddies that play on PC mean that I'm doing all of this as a lone commando.

2b. As a result of this my leveling has been almost solely geared to guerrilla to max out my turret. I have it filled all the way up to the last level (2 turret guns), gunpowder only received 5 points to buff gun damage, and the third tier (can't remember the name) has enough to get the shield on the turret. 
__________________
**My questions: SKIP HERE IF YOU DON'T LIKE READING**

1. My shields and health are at 38 and 51 thousand respectively and at level 50 they're going down in one shot pretty often. Are these low for the level? I pretty much throw my turret and hide behind it (not fun) as a result.

2. Is playing solo going to be a death party like this for the rest of TVHM and UVHM?

3. What would you change if this was your setup and you want to be more effective?

4. Will farming The Bunker solve all my problems?

Outside of that I am open to any other suggestions.

Thanks and have an awesome Monday,

I hope everyone is having a good day/week/month/quarter.

I recently took the plunge from an account executive selling SaaS to work full time on my own business.

I went from having a BDR setting meetings for me to pretty much cold calling whenever I'm not in a face to face meeting with a potential client (I didn't realize how good I had it). 

Going back to my cold calling roots has proven to be a handful and I'm looking to maximize my production in any way possible.

My company offers a new way to address a long standing issues for nonprofits, and without going into the details of the operation, about 90% of the people that I speak with say they get what I'm saying but they would like an email to get a better understanding of what we're offering.

I have my cold call script down to about 20 seconds and this includes asking for a 20 minute meeting; it's succinct and clear, but because it presents something brand new people are defaulting to asking for more information. I rebut this by saying we'll cover everything in the 20 minutes, but that hasn't netted a meeting yet. 

My question is this: should I just accept the fact that because this is something different an informative email is going to be part of the process, or is there a better way to avoid this and close a meeting on this first call?

I have always had success in cold calling, but everything that I have been offering up to this point was a lot more widely known than what I'm currently bringing to the market.

I was going to post to /r/DJs but it seems pretty circle jerkish and there are some heavy anti-Live overtones going on so I'll try my luck here.

I am mixing hip hop with future beat (is that a type of music?) songs, with some random samples from classic rock, 90's alternative, and the like thrown in. They don't really always groove like standard EDM so it's taking some guess and check to get things to fit together. My long term goal is to be able to put together live performance sets a la Hemsworth or RL Grime.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1077&amp;v=EO1UlT9mPRI

**To my point:**

I just started playing with Live 9 and an APC40 mkii for mixing or live production, whichever you'd like to call it. To help with this I purchased Will Marshall's template which I can't say enough good things about. 

I am cutting songs into .als files and using a color and naming convention to help define a clip's BPM, timbre, length, and genre.

My questions about the setup and performance process follow. If these are personal preference I am curious to see how you personally handle the process.
__________
1 - Do you build a predefined sets and just let the clips play through with Follow Actions, or are you piecing things together on the fly?

2 - Is it best to cut all of the main clips into 4, 8, 16 beats, etc., or if there is a 1/4 bar lead in (for example) do you leave that on the clip and set the start to reflect it? 

**Edit** Along these lines, if a clip doesn't have whole 4, 8, 16 bar length are the Start Actions global? i.e. if there's a 1/2 note lead in when I select the clip with my APC40 will Live recognize this and bring in the beat a 1/2 note early?

3 - I use command + e to cut clips, then cut and paste into Session View. Is this the most effective way? if there's a sample from the song that could be used to connect songs do you make an extra clip and set that in its own area, or is that left as a part of the main group?

4 - A lot of the songs that I have are already remixes with a lot of audio FX added to them. Is this cheap or is it okay to use them? There are a lot of glitches and washouts already added and I feel like if I got things together properly there won't be a lot of work other than starting and stopping clips and songs.

I have been tall and skinny my whole life. I pitched through college and never really took many at bats after high school before playing senior league.  Luckily most pitchers pitch me outside and I can smash from the shortstop to right field (I'm a righty). 

Over the past couple years I have been working out a ton but I am still having trouble with high and inside fastballs that are still in the strike zone.

At best I pop them up foul down the first baseline, and I have never been able to hit pitches there with authority. Down and in is fine but once it gets up to mid thigh or so I'm worthless.

What tips do you guys have to have success with these pitches? I know a lot of guys salivate when they see a ball here and I just can't get it to click.

This was a PR attempt (my best of 4 for this session) at 102kg/225lbs. 

Everything felt good on the pull and under, but my catch looked messed up. I am looking for feedback on all aspects of the lift, but as you'll read below I noticed some weird things about my catch on this attempt.

For the record I have had two surgeries on my right shoulder for a SLAP lesion from pitching (first surgery didn't work, and the second one let me with my biceps tendon screwed into the top of my Humerus as a solution).

When I paused the video when I am in the bottom position I noticed that my left arm looks good, but my right arm's rotation isn't in the same 'elbow down' position as my left arm. When I watched it in .25x speed I also saw that this caused my right arm to almost snap out of the catch and I think that's why I bailed on the lift. 


[Image of bottom position](http://i.imgur.com/aFBFk6I.png)

The lift felt funky, but not painful. After watching the clip I think this may be why.

Thoughts or recommendations on how to fix this or anything else on the lift?

Thanks!

What did you find to help the most in streamlining your workflow? 

Regularly recreating a lot of the ambiance that is part of futurebeats is still beyond me as a whole. Googling for this information is tough and I normally don't come up with genre specific results that would help the most. 

What did/do you use to learn the foundation of futurebeat production?

What else helped you the most? I've just been a sponge since I started and I'm looking to keep that up so thanks for sharing anything you've got.

It feels really odd. Is this just something that takes some getting used to?

When you pull from blocks what are your queues? Do you have separate ones for snatches and cleans?

I'm going to stick with it but it would be great to hear how everyone else locks in before a lift.
