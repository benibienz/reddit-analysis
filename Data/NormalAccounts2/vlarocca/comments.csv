Invent the options for mutual gain

The authors identify four obstacles to inventing the options for mutual gain:[7]

    Premature judgment: deciding on one option and failing to consider the alternatives
    Searching for one single answer
    The assumption of a fixed pie: assuming there is only a win/lose solution
    Thinking that ""solving their problem is their problem""

The authors also propose four ways to overcome these obstacles:

    Separate invention process from decision making
    Broaden your options
    Search for mutual gains
    Invent ways of making their decision easy

The process of inventing should be in an informal atmosphere where the both parties sit together and brainstorm about possible solutions. Wild and creative ideas should be encouraged. After the list of possible options is made, parties should use a process of evaluation to find the most promising options. It is helpful to look for shared interests and also to create options which are appealing to other side and which they find easy to agree with.

he asset management industry and a technology that has found favour with drug dealers do not seem like natural bedfellows. Yet blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, the controversial digital currency, is being heralded as “revolutionary” for fund houses.

The nascent technology’s would-be impact on financial services has been likened to the effect the internet had on the music and media industries. Blockchain has the potential to turn the finance industry on its head, saving asset managers billions of dollars and “making the whole investing process much quicker and more transparent”, says Jeff Levi, a partner at Casey Quirk, a consultancy.

FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best stories from across the web

It is a far cry from a few years ago, when bitcoin — and by default blockchain — was labelled the “Wild West of finance”. The cryptocurrency is best known for its fluctuating value and use on the dark web, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software and which is often used for criminal activity, such as buying drugs or guns.

The focus has shifted from bitcoin to blockchain, which, in essence, is a giant, online public ledger that keeps track of who owns bitcoins — and who owned it in the past. If you bought an item using bitcoin, the blockchain would record that the ownership of the digital currency has moved from the seller to you.

It is this continuous and quick recording of transactions that has the financial services industry both excited and scared. “It is a really, really exiting area for the asset management industry,” says Jackie Alvarez, who is carrying out research on blockchain for Investit, a consultancy.

Most commentators say blockchain’s biggest impact on the fund industry will be in the clearing and settlement process, the often dull side of asset management that involves moving ownership of securities from one investor to another.

When an asset manager buys a security, a large number of in-house staff and service providers set to work processing the transaction. A record of the trade is submitted to the clearing agency, often a bank, which then matches the buyer and seller records. Money to pay for the security is moved from the buyer to the seller, while the security is given to the buyer.

These labour-intensive jobs can take days, tying up cash in the process.

Widespread adoption of blockchain could mean almost instantaneous settling of securities, says Hu Liang, senior managing director of the emerging technologies centre at State Street, the US bank. “It is an efficiency play.”

Quicker settlement would also have a big effect on asset managers’ balance sheets. Fund houses would need far fewer staff for some roles, says Mr Levi.

Faster settlement “changes the whole workload. That is a fundamental change in their operating model”, adds Chris Mills, who runs the global blockchain initiative at KPMG, the consultancy.

Asset managers could get rid of their cumbersome and expensive IT systems, adds Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, a consortium of banks and fintech companies working together to use blockchain. “All of this would have a significant impact on reducing costs,” he says.

Steve Libby, co-chairman of the digital/fintech forum at Alfi, the fund industry association in Luxembourg, adds: “The knock-on effects [of faster and more accurate settling] are very positive for the asset management industry.”

Other uses for blockchain include making it easier for asset managers to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers.

Blockchain could furthermore play a role in preventing money laundering by helping asset managers to understand who their underlying investors are.

The adoption of blockchain by asset managers would be good news for investors, says Mr Cooper. “Any time you can make the system safer and reduce costs, that is good for investors.”

Despite all the potential uses of blockchain, few asset managers are running projects to see if the technology works.

Alex Birkin, advisory leader at EY, the consultancy, says: “A lot of asset managers are observing [the work that is being done to develop blockchain technology], rather than committing a lot of their money.”

This is in stark contrast to other parts of the financial services sector. JPMorgan Chase said last week it had begun a trial project using blockchain to cut costs and reduce the hassle of trading. The US bank is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, best known for creating the modern credit default swap.

The Nasdaq stock exchange used blockchain for the first time in December to transfer shares.

Banks are also working together in consortiums such as R3 to see how blockchain can be used in financial markets. R3 recently opened up its membership to asset managers, although none has joined so far.

One of the reasons behind this reluctance to embrace blockchain is because of its associations with bitcoin.

“The stigma around bitcoin has distracted people from the benefits of blockchain technology and the applicability of blockchain. Had there not been the stigma around blockchain, people would have realised faster how useful the technology could be,” says Angus McLean, a partner at Simmons &amp; Simmons, the law firm.

Many asset managers still have concerns about the technology, chiefly how scalable it is and how robust the encryption is, says EY’s Mr Birkin.

Then there is asset managers’ general reluctance to embrace technologies. “In the asset industry, technological change comes at a glacial pace. It tends to come later rather than sooner,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the UK-based consultancy.

Asset managers who think blockchain is not a big deal for them are mistaken, says R3’s Mr Cooper. “If you are sitting there thinking this doesn’t affect me, that is not the case.”
‘Wild West of finance’: Digital currencies grow, but concerns remain

Bitcoin has a chequered past.

Since its invention seven years ago, the digital currency has been heavily associated with crime. It has found favour with individuals looking to buy drugs or weapons on the dark net, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software.

Its value has fluctuated widely. The price of a bitcoin reached a high of $1,124.75 in November 2013. It now typically trades at between $200 and $300.

There are widespread concerns about the security of the digital currency, while officials are worried about the lack of a central authority overseeing it.

Thanks to these issues, one US regulator described bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the “Wild West of finance” in 2014.

Mike Hearn, a prominent developer of bitcoin, recently called the cryptocurrency a “failed experiment”.

Yet bitcoin is gaining some legitimacy. There are 100,000 merchants that accept bitcoin for payment, including PayPal, Expedia, the travel-booking site, and Microsoft, the technology company.

The UK also wants to become a hub for bitcoin trading and Europe’s top court ruled bitcoin should be treated as money for tax purposes.

The court’s decision “is the first step in securing bitcoin’s future as a genuine alternative to national currencies”, Richard Asquith, a vice-president at Avalara, the tax compliance company, told the FT.",2016-02-07 12:00:40+00:00,czqz4hn,1.0,t3_44lbv0,19.0,Bitcoin

Here's one example:

""Bitcoinist: Can you tell our readers your opinion of Altcoins?

Daniel KrawiszDK: The value of a currency is caused by how widely demanded it is. The reason you hold cash is because you know you can very easily get rid of it in exchange for whatever you need at any time. The interesting thing about that is the more that people want cash, the more objectively useful it is. This is what I mean by the network effect. If the network effect really is the explanation for the value of a currency, as I claim it is, then it becomes very difficult to imagine how two currencies could be in equilibrium with one another. Any trend which promoted the growth of one at the expense of the other would tend to reinforce itself: for the growth of the network inherently improves the usefulness of the currency, thus attracting more people to it regardless of the original reason that the growth took place.

I think that altcoins are networks of people who talk a lot about issues that would be moot without answers to fundamental questions about the economics of their situation, which they have consistently been unable to provide. For example, a necessary prerequisite before I would invest in a currency other than Bitcoin would be an explanation as to how it will beat Bitcoin. If you’re not even going to try to do that, then from an investment standpoint, I would say that you might as well not bother creating the altcoin at all.""",2015-12-15 17:44:46+00:00,cxzy8x0,1.0,t3_3wxqea,15281.0,Bitcoin
