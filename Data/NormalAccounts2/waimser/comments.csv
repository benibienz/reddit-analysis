My game runs really smooth on 30fps. Sure its not as nice as 60, you can definitely notice the difference, but its perfectly playable and the framerate is solid as a rock 99.9% of the time.

Approach at same speed you would a station, ie, 75%throttle at 7 seconds indicated to target. For smaller planets you may need to drop to 50% just before you get to the planet.

Drop to 50% throttle as you duck under the blue line. From here on control your throttle up an down as much as needed for you to be able to achieve the following.

While in orbital flight, keep your distance above the surface between 1/3 and 1/2 that of your distance to target. Closer to half works better but having a wider range allows you to approach faster while comparing the numbers. On some ships it helps to fly upside down during this stage so you can keep your target right next to the altitude reading rather than having to look way over at the target display panel to see distance.

Once you enter glide, aim to overshoot your target a bit. You drop from glide at a pretty consistent altitude, aim to be above your target as you reach that altitude.

Though if you already have another ship for missions, then the only reason to get rid of your HRPs is probably jump raange, and if youre just doing hunting, CZ, and Assassinations, then I doubt jump range matters at all.

The only one of your points that isnt frighteningly trivial to get is the modular terminals and even they are easy once you get the missions to drop.

Ive got a fully t5 upgraded ship, multiple ships actually, with around 10 hours of in game time. In a game with a 10 year plan, having access to the best equipment after such a short time is so easy its a joke. Anyone reading this whose ever played any other mmo, or any good rpg is actually laughing at you right now. That level of upgrading is SUPPOSED to be hard and time consuming. It is not supposed to be some trivial thing you knock off on a weekend.

I know some mmo players who are still chasing items after several years of hard work. Not just playing the game like you can in ed and fet your stuff. Nope these people organise and lead multiple raids every day, run missions that are impossible to do without good teamwork, every day for months. They design and level miltiple characters each with a specific purpose, a process that takes weeks or months for each of them, just to allow them to complete content with some reliability. 

They do this over and over again for items with a ≤1% drop rate, then watch as others get the drop instead of them. And you know what?

They fucking love it!

Then you and every other carebear schmuck load up ED and when you cant have your maxed out ship in a few days you cry like fucking bitches. You plead the devs to make it easier,AND THEY DID, then youre still not happy. 

I just dont understand you people, its a game, and upgrading is part of that game. Its also some of the most interresting game play the devs have come up with so far. Yes thats right, the devs delivered some actual game play and everyone fucking cries about it because it takes too long. 

Fuck you people. Fucking vocal minority carebears have wrecked enough shit in this game already, stop trying to ruin the only interresting thing the fame currently has to offer.

My first round I got lucky and rolled Phasing on both weapons within 3 rolls, so I thought id give them a shot. Would Not recommend. I felt the damage loss was just too much for such a small amount of bleed through damage. So I stuck them in storage and wandered off for another try.

I decided to aim for nice rolls rather than any experimental effects this time. I didnt get any ""amazing"" rolls but they are decent considering I only had 6 rolls left for 2 weapons. 

They are awesome to use. Its kind of difficult to directly compare to incindery MC, but to me they feel a little better over all just because it allows me to stay in RES for as long as I like without needing ammo. Damage against shields maybe a bit above, to hull a bit below Incindery MC.

I wouldnt bother with anything below t5 for the Rapid fire mod, the jitter would be too much. With the t5 mod the jitter is quite noticable on gimbals. the only ships I have trouble hitting though are Viper size and below. Having no trouble hitting larger ships, but module sniping can be problematic. My up close and personal flying style helps too

One big tip I have is to know the system you are heading to. Check it out in the map when you are plotting your route, or at some point on the way there.

Alot of systems have asteroid belts. These basically create an invisible gravity well that will slow down your supercruise travel. Invisible, because they dont show up with an orbital line on your HUD like planets do.

For systems with asteroid belts, the first thing to do when entering the system is to travel away from the star in a direction perpendicular to the ecliptic, or orbital plane of the system. Once you are far enough out that asteroid belts will no longer affect you, then start to loop back towards your destination. I  possibly overdo this distance a bit, turning only after I reach 5-10C, but ive not found this bet of extra distance to be any issue vs the time saved not being slowed down by something you cant see.",2016-11-02 08:56:00+00:00,d9i4gz8,1.0,t3_5annd1,21023,EliteDangerous

125,"Youre just not seeing it. Im trying to give your idea some thought so as to not be all, im right, youre wrong, but its really hard. You just cant have, in a game like ED with any sort of pvp, a runaway system where  the highest tier is a necessity and better in every way than lower tiers. It creates the situation of the player with the most time, being more powerful than those with less time.

Sure, to do my method correctly takes time and resources, any method of balancing does. If you want to have a healthy pvp environment though, you need to spend those things and make it right. If you are unwilling to put the resources forward to balance pvp, then dont make a game that has pvp.

Have you lost sight of your own question? Is .... a better option? The answer, imo is no. It creates the runaway scenario i described above. This is possibly worse than what we have now because at least now its plausable you might get lucky on a low tier roll and have something as good as that guy whose farming non stop.

Is the systwm i suggested the right one? I dont know, ive had good comments and criticism on it before. Is balancing pvp difficult? Fuck yes! But you cant just abandon pvp balance and throw in a system that could only possibly be acceptable in a purely pve game, just because its costs to do it right.

You math out the basics, then tweak it till you get it right. Guess what, they are already doing exactly that process, making your last comment almost completely moot(imas actually really sorry to say that but its the way it is).  The problem is, which we both seemed to agree on before this conversation even srarted(correct me if im wrong), is that the system they have started with and are now trying to balance, is garbage, and need to be replaced with something that can actually be balanced for pvp. 

The current system cant be balanced for pvp. The only way your system could possibly be balanced for pvp, is if the highest tier could be achieved in a short enough amount of time to allow dedicated pvp players to achieve the highest tier in a reasonably short amount of time. Well, then you might as well have just made it a single upgrade with only one result, one tier. Then if youve gone that far, you might as well just not have created engineers at all since the end result is exactly the same as it was before they existed.  Youd either be upgraded enough to be ready for pvp, or youre not.",2016-10-30 16:53:09+00:00,d9e3he7,9.0,t1_d9e0fqx,4709,EliteDangerous
126,"To understand the problem with your system. Imagine a moba where one team gets a 20 minute head start. The player that has time to farm for those dramatically increased number of materials gains an advantage over someone with less time to farm. The more time passes, the greater the advantage that player gets. 

I can see the need for assymetry in alot of games, but if you in any way care about pvp balance you must give it priority. Also, those games most likely all have hundreds or many more types of npc enemies, all needing to be balanced around. In Ed we really only have a few types, you can balance the player capabilities around pvp and adjust npc behavior/stats to suit.

If you keep your system to a set amount of tiers then yes if is arguably better than rng as player capabilities can ""eventually"" level out. But it still give too much of an advantage fo the player with 20 times the amount of time to spend in the game.



Edit.sorrry dont think i answered your question. I have a problem with rng when it ""negatively"" affects pvp. There are situations where rng can havd great and inrerresting affects on game play.

130,".1.Most mmos are based off tabletop style combat. Swing a sword, each side rolls a dice for attack and defence, damage based on the difference. ED is not based on that style in any way. Defense numbers are set, attack numbers are set, there is no rng per hit, its just not that sort of game.

.2. Most mmos dont have a heavy pvp component.

.3. Games that do have rng per hit and pvp do something else other than rng to provide balance. Some even the stats, giving new players and old alike, access to the exact same stats and gear. Others like a couple very popular mobas, give every player in the match access to the same amount of available time to earn their stats and gear.

You cant take a game like ED, and apply rng to equipment(stats). Its like having 2 ppl start a duel, getting everyone geared up and ready in place, then flipping a coin to decide the winner. Or maybe even worse than that, its like having the coin be flipped 3 weeks ago but noone tells the fighters who the winner is until after theyve beaten on each other for a while.

Imagine a LoL match, execpt 1 team is allowed to start farming 15 minites before the other, would you call that a balanced match? This is the same as adding rng to upgrades in ED, rather than each player choosing their loadout, and fighting, it comes down to who has spent the most time farming materials to spent on engineers to try for that perfect roll.

You need balanced tiers. t5 is an upgrade from t3 for the thing you want to upgrade it for, bit it drops below t3 in some other respect, ie, more damge, but also more heat generation to balance it.

The overall power of the t5 item can be a bit higher than t3 but within acceptable levels to maintain balance. The materials needed for t5 must be much higher though.

It makes sense when you combine the two, but when looking at either one, it just seems way out of place.

I agree with the other guy that said it. I really think scale hadnt been decided until too late, all the cockpits interiors seem like they are made to feel like we are sittin in a car seat or a cockpit  similar to what we have today. The dash is made to look like it is right up near us like we are used to.

Then someone realised, or was told, that these things are MUCH bigger than they were designing the interiors for, and instead of redesigning the interiors, they just made the seat look tiny from the outside to match the numbers.

The sacle feels wrong because the cockpits were designed as that, a cockpit, of a small ship, rather than being designed as the bridge of a star ship.

Maybe our sensors use an extension of fsd technology that feels out the mass etc of our ships. Chaff could then be lots of tiny fsds with just enough power for a few seconds of use and the sensors dont know which one to lock on to.

I agree with op that pll should just enjoy the game and not burn out doing the grind all at once. Or at least only do the grind if you enjoy it. I consider it just part of the game to upgrade my ship so ive really been enjoying it, but ive certainly taken breaks from it when needed.

I also see that some ppl consider pvp to be ,the game, for them. So for these ppl they absolutely have to upgrade just to be competative enough play the game.

I reallly think the problem is the rng. At least if fd had been intelligent and made a tier based crafting system that could be balanced, then youd pick what you want to do, and do it. With this shitty combo of rng, and no downside to the highest tier, then to be competative you kind of need to keep rolling and hoping for perfection.

Fd need to admit that they completely neglected to think about pvp balance when designing engineers, and return to the drawing board. A tried and true pro/con crafting system that can be balanced is one solution that ticks alot of boxes. It would allow some of the grind to remain, and be repeated if someone wants to try something different, while scrapping the ridiculous need to constantly keep trying endlessly. 

Funny enough, this system helps the module storage problem too. You wouldnt need to store so many modules since if you wanted to try something different you could craft over what you have onboard but know you can go back to what you had without losing it forever.",2016-10-17 15:52:23+00:00,d8vu7c8,2.0,t1_d8vqgqe,4871,EliteDangerous

Guild wars2. Theres just always something going on. You can be on your way to complate a fetch quest and before you know it youve been dragged along a series of events for the last 2 hours, along with a bunch of other players who also stumbled across your path at some stage. Alot of the game is fetch and carry, but it never feels like it.

Dungeons and Dragons Online. I still pinch myseld over this game. How can something with only a set amount of missions be so damn complex and replayable? Sadly the player pop has been steadily dropping and it hurts game play, since you often need multiple classes of character to complete a quest easily, though there are usually alternative methods.

Guild Wars 1 does a great job of making the simple types seem like epic adventures, and has LOTS of interresting lore to uncover.

Ive heared good things about starwars the old republic, but Ive not played it yet.

If it doesnt have to be an mmo, theres more you could look at.

Baulders gate. I remember there being nice puzzles and mysteries, but could be nostalgia tinted goggles here.

Gauntlet. Old PS1 game. Always had you on the lookout for environmental clues. You gould get lost as hell in that game, or have to backtrack forever to find an item you need, or a key shown somewhere.

Diablo II. Another one that makes it feel like what youre doing isnt fetch n carry.

Bards tale. Takes the piss out of fetch and carry the entire game. Manages to be a great game at the same time. Also, you can get it on android and Iphone.

Just cause 2. Say what you want about it, that game is the ultimate in doing the same thing a hundred times with every time feeling brand new.

GTA Series. GTA5 did it really well. great story missions side by side with random popups, phone calls, and just crazy shit suddenly happening.

If you want to keep it in the space ship genre, Freelancer is pretty great. It has its fair share of fetch and kill, bit itll sure take you on a wild ride in between. If it had hotas controls, id probably still be playing it. I hate the hell out of its mouse only control setup and I still played the shit out of it.

This is just a few from the piddly pool of game ive played. Id love for anyone with wider base of play to shoot some more options.

Its also possible for games to have missions that are practically on rails but feel like you are in complete control, or that its total chaos. Anyone whos played CoD4 knows what im talking about.

225,"Pros...good looks, shield, massive lateral thrust, a much smaller target betrer hardpoint layout foe fixed weapons.

Cons... pitch rate, slow speed, class 2 weapons are underneath which sucks for gimbaled, smaller internals.

I also want to point out a big con for the Cobra. It has a big difference in speed between boost and normal speed. So after you boost, theres a period of time your pitch rate really slows down while you slow back down to get into the blue zone again. This wont worry alot of ppl, but i hate it.

If your flying style already tends towards boost turns and jousting then youll not notice the lack of pitch rate on the Viper, and the extra shield strength will help you alot. Plus youll have much stronger lateral thrust which might help you learn better flying technique.

If you like to get into slow turn fights and manage to stay out of the line of fire well enough, then the shields on the cobra may be good enough for you, and you'll benefit from the cobras pitch rate and its class 2 weapons being on the nose will allow gimbaled weapons to track your target.

If you spend a decent amount of time trading, smuggling, or doing long haul missions, then stick to the Cobra, it will serve you better.",2016-10-13 02:04:01+00:00,d8ppa6s,3.0,t1_d8pe0cj,16070,EliteDangerous
226,"The mkIV actually has really quite strong shields for its price bracket. Im actually trying out biweaves atm too and they are fine.

You dont have to joust with it though. Its lateral thrusters are goddamn amazing. Circle straffe your target and pummel them from above. And ill let slip a little tip here... cargo hatch... if your rarget goes evasive and is trying to just circle you but you dont want to joist, pop your cargo hatch open, youll slow down and turn inside them, use with lateral thrust for best effect.

Another way to avoid jousting is to gorget weapons altogether for a bit. Go 4 pips to engines and use 2 or 3 boosrs in a row to get back behind them.

Alot of your comments are spot on. Hull tanking isnt the best idea, and its turning is slow as hell. The Cobra is a MUCH easier bird to fly. Also, yes, the ViperIV really shines once you upgrade the crap out of it. I really think it might even be a viable pvp maching if it had more utility slots and a teensy bit more speed. I actually didnt really like it before i got it engineered, but as soon as i slapped a t1 thruster upgrade on it, i was in love.

Another note on hull tanking. The Cobra does it almost as well. Fill them both with HRPs and their hull numbers are pretty close.

The cockpit from the FAS

Looks like the CobraIV but shorter front to back so its not such a big target. Or like the Hunter concept shown on the wiki.

Balance very close to the Courier, so...

4 utility slots.

Shields slightly weaker than courier.

Optional internals the same as Courier except an extra size 3.

Boost speed and slightly higher cruise speed than the CobraIII. Ship is lighter maybe so speed scales slightly better when engineered.

2 medium,1large hardpoint. Might be a bit much though, so maybe 3 or 4 mediums

Handling stats a bit better or same as the ViperIV.

Jump range same as the Courier.

Preferably not rank locked but fed would be ok because of the cockpit and being the counterpart to the Courier.

I really think the hame still has potential though. They proved they could listen to feedback   on the issue by making the AI harder in combat. They have taken feedback onboard and are rethinking the ship transfer mechanic(for better or worse i dont know). 

As much as i had a brief rant just a few minutes ago about the constant interdiction while carrying cargo, Ive really enjoyed the extra challenge the last couple days doing some mining. It just needs balancing, ie, less frequent, more dangerous. But thata a topic for another day.

Approach at same speed you would a station, ie, 75%throttle at 7 seconds indicated to target. For smaller planets you may need to drop to 50% just before you get to the planet.

Drop to 50% throttle as you duck under the blue line. From here on control your throttle up an down as much as needed for you to be able to achieve the following.

While in orbital flight, keep your distance above the surface between 1/3 and 1/2  that of your distance to target. Closer to half works better but having a wider range allows you to approach faster while comparing the numbers. On some ships it helps to fly upside down during this stage so you can keep your target right next to the altitude reading rather than having to look way over at the target display panel to see distance.

Once you enter glide, aim to overshoot your target a bit. You drop from glide at a pretty consistent altitude, aim to be above your target as you reach that altitude.

349,"1. These are not bounties posted by players. They are the pitiful excuse for bounties that are not visible on a player outside of a single system unless KWScanned. Being able to post large bounties on players that can be seen galaxy wide would open up good interactive game play.

2. How would this be difficult? Player stats are already recorded, it just needs to say on a stations galnet how long ago a player was in system or something along those lines. I see no problem lore wise with players being logged by the local security, especially if they are wanted. Anarchysystems wouldnt log, low sec may only log if they come within range of station or spend time in system. It only needs to be players that have bounties on them that get tracked/logged. 

Players will ALWAYS find a way to abuse a system for the purpose of griefing or murdering ppl. The instances of it happening vs how many ppl are playing though is so stupidly low that it is not worth worrying about. If you are so fucking scared of greifers that you wont put systems in place to open up legitimately great game play then you might as well not make or play the game at all.

3 Thats the point, its not supposed to go well for the pirate in high sec! Im glad its like this, but the security response is still not enough. If you murder someone in high sec, you should have very little chance to escape safely. At the moment, you can pretty much waltz away having taken a light tap to your shields.

While on the topic. There are too many high sec systems imo. If high sec enforcement response were to be drastically increased then there would need to be a change in how systems security is rated or you end up with nowhere to commit these crimes. Safety concious and scared commanders could still high sec hop if they want. Devs would need to make sure that there are enough high profit runs and CGs in systems other than high sec.",2016-09-03 06:58:37+00:00,d77rmzs,3.0,t1_d77q67i,4483,EliteDangerous

There is the Type 6 for pure cargo. But it cannot take care of itself in a fight at all.

If you end up switching to the Cobra, be really careful on your first few landings. Its lateral thrusters arent nearly as good as the Viper.

To OP.

The FAS has decent yjump range in full combat fit and you can keep some cargo space too. It comfortable to travel with if you get your FSD upgraded.

If budget is limited but you have access to thruster upgrades then the ViperIV is actually really nice, both for travelling and fighting. Eve n T1 shield upgrade can bring it over 300 shields and a couple hill packages and the military upgrade ahe can really tank alot of hits. All while having good jump range and enough cargo for the basics. Without thruster upgrades though it flies like its in soup.

DBS is like the baby sister to the FAS. Turns on a dime and has enough slots for a little bit of everything. Ita a little weak on defence but it would absolutely be my choice if i couldnt afford an Asp or access thrusters upgrades for the ViperIV.

If you can afford it and have even the slightest disloke for travelling then just bring an As as suggested above.

392,"Good post, lots of info. And the only ""correct"" one so far, in terms of reliably doing it fast.

To tldr it..

Approach at 100% throttle

When timer says 0:07 hit your 75% throttle key.

If you want to fine tune this method you can try time it and hit 75% just before the timer ticks to 0:06, but the difference is minimal. 

You can do other things like approaching faster ant throttling to 0 and circling then bringing throttle back up. But again, the difference is minimal, and until you get the hang of where to cut throttle you can end up taking way longer.

 Your biggest time saver is learning to line up your drop with the entrance as posted above. Get yourself right between the station and planet, you want the orbit line of the station to look as straight as possible in front of you to maximise your chance of being in front of the entrance.",2016-08-19 04:57:52+00:00,d6nooul,2.0,t1_d6n7p9h,25772,EliteDangerous

I have to admit, the FAS is tempting. I love the way it flies and it has enough internals to have some spare cargo space, and I think an upgraded FSD should give decent jump range too.

She looks Fkn amazing at night! She flies pretty good though has a vibration problem at just under hover power so descending is pretty shaky. Unfortunately I dont think I can reccommend this particular frame because of the vibrations. The arms have a resonant frequency that is very close to the rpm of the motors during flight, so it can get massive vibrations that build up until it can barely stay in the air while moving all over the place. Ive tried several types of props, including my last set of undamaged genuine Hubsan props, and they dont help. I am using 3.5mm zid ties as landing gear instead of the supplied bolts so that the extra mass changes the resonant frequency just enough to fly well. If I was going to buy again, id measure closely and see if the 80mm frame would leave enough room for the FPV cam, since I ADORE every thing else about the frame.

The small holes out near the motors and in place for the accessory attachment are threaded. A real nice tightly fitting thread for the supplied plastic bolts. There are specially cut spots to fit the LEDs, the whole frame lights up really nicely.

The props I got in bulk seem pretty good apart from a few that the hole is too big to grip the motor well enough. Im getting pretty good flight time(not measured yet), so they seem reasonably efficient.

The standard motor wires on the Hubsan are too short for this particular frame. The wires that came with the spare motors are a bit longer, bit barely long enough still. I had to extend 1 wire to make it fit neatly. So if you have a Hubsan without LEDs the 100mm CF/birch frame might be a better option.

Even though the build was harder/more time consuming than id hoped, im really enjoying the build. Since I already had so much of the parts, the only outlay was for the camera and frame, so I have no regrets in going for this build instead of a DJ-105. She has plenty of power to spare despite being a bit overweight, and handles nicely at speed.

I think around th 600mm range should be enough. At that size they are still cheap enough that many ppl can fly without breaking the bank, but still big enough that a crash has potential to mess it up badly. Spactators need the prospect of a little carnage to stay interested. They are still goung to be very fast, possibly faster, and very agile, but big enough for ppl to see whats going on without having their own set of goggles or watching a screen.

I have a very atrong opinion on this topic. We need to be racing larger aircraft if we want the sport to gain popularity with ppl who dont fly themselves. The quad pictured is just way too big though, youd need to be racing around race courses as big as current car race tracks for it to be interresting and it will never be safe for spectators without them or the aircraft being fully enclosed.",2016-07-28 17:39:46+00:00,d5upqnd,2.0,t1_d5ubojw,19401,Multicopter

My siggestion that i wwish id been told when i started. Use either melle weaps, or use axe torch for condi. Set your pets to avoid combat. Set easy to reach hotkeys for pet attack, active skill, and callback. Get yourself either jungle stalker or red moa or both as pets, their actives are powerful buffs.

Get right in there and fight the mobs close, use your pets active going into combat every time and as soon as its off cooldown for longer fights. Only have your pets attack stronger targets that need the extra dps.

Doing this will start you along the road to having the skils needed for endgame content and pvp. Plus its about 2000 times more fun than longbow.

First, id resolder it in place. Get as much solder off as you can first and clean it up really good. Dont skimp on the flux, and use a nice hot iron, use a little more solder than you normally would, and make sure your result is a nice shiny surface so you know it was hot enough.

Then, id clean it really well again, and use some apoxy putty to beef up around the join. Have the putty come down over the nut section a little, but leave enough room for your spanner to grip, and extent it about 1cm up the wire part. Doesnt have to be a big glob of putty used, just needs to be enough to not break under impact. If you have a big crash, check the putty, if it's cracked you can clean it, and use a tiny bit more to strengthen it again.

If you are the type to only do the harder challenges when you have help available, or dont do anything other than wade through mobs spamming AOE, then sure youre gonna have a hard time. But if you are the type to learn how your class works, take on the hero challenges and champions alone for the challenge, and have eyes enough to be on the lookout for enemy character animations, then youll be pretty ok.

For spvp, checkout some builds on the metabattle wiki, but then read through all the skills and traits and if you dont understand why the build works then either go for a different one, or swap out some traits for ones that you understand why they work together. Theres no point running the top teir ele builds etc unless you know the details and rotations, much better to use something simpler and straight forward that you understand.

For wvw, you should maybe wait till you are max lvl and have a full set of rare armor with matching runes, just dont spend much on it cause youll be swapping it out soon. Without reasonable armor, youll be a theif and mesmers wet dream and theyll 1 shot you wherever you go.

What I did to get the hang of wvw was kit out in the tankiest set of armor and runes I could find, with the most defensive/evasive build I could find, then just ran with the zerg for a few weeks. The tanky/evasive build was just to let me stay alive long enough to see how fights and strategies played out, rather than die at the start of every encounter and end up learning nothing.

526,"IMO Thief is the most fun to lvl and play through the story. Mobility out the whazoo, and flashy enough. Dont play an Asura thief if you like to see character animations though, they are too small. All thiefs flashy stuff is based on character animation rather than lights and explosions like the others so you want a large enough character to see the cool stuff.

 Ranger is for you if you are a pokemon player, but otherwise can be a little boring in pve. 

All the other classes seem on about par, funwise, for pve, they are all fun in their own way but take longer before you start to get the most enjoyment out of them. For example, I hated guardian at low lvls compared to the other classes. I decided to not play it till I had enough tomes to insta 80, and now that I have, I frikkin love it.

I play from australia, and the only trouble I have with my 250-280ms ping is with with the higher lvl thief combos needed for long term invis and massive gap closing. Plus a couple of the mobility skills dont work as well, but thats not game breaking. Even these problems are only really evident in pvp and wvw.

The ""tiny woop"" is really popular atm too and looks like a solid build. Since you would be changing motors on it for the fpv build, you can wear out the original motors learning to fly line of sight first.

Hell, there was one player ages ago that figured out how noob i was and would wander around with me, knowing i couldnt touch them. We kept each other silent company for a while and rarely saw another player from either team. Id sit back and watch them 1v1 and they brought me into the fight with a hit if it looked  1 sided, and didnt interfere with my 1v1. It was kinda cool because of that, but man it was dead.

I decided to give wvw a go this weekend and its goddamn amazing fro my pov. Within an hour i was in jq twamspeak and having massive 3 way battles. Looks like it may not be so busy during the week, but i sure know where ill be spending every weekend for the forseeable future. EDIT:I wanted to point out its not just the zergs that make it great. Theres still enough pll roaming in small groups that you can get some really nice skirmishes withoit being over run by a zerg. Ive even managed a couple 1v1s, and it seems ppl will often still repect an ongoing 1v1 without interfering. Ive even seen enemy skirting a group and our side yoyoing a bit intil it gets decided who will go fight, the rest moving on or watching. All from 1 weekend of play. Also sorry to the engi i was fighting when i accidently retreated to our zerg, you had me and i was trying to regen some to have a chance.

Looks like jq have a few great commanders, id love to see how wed be doing with a few more numbers round the clock.

The feeling of fighting over a single location for an hour or more and seeing the updates from scouts and other commanders is fkn awesome, it really feels like a massive battlefield.

However, running in a small group in wvw youre always gonna get jumped at some point.

If I get stunned, I hit the one stun break I carry and im pretty much home free from there. 

Its these situations I feel like the thief should excell, and should do it better with just the one stun break as well because they shouldnt get a second chance to stun me. But, and sorry im gonna repeat this alot, my stun breaks and dodges never seem to work and I dont get the chance to use the mobility I have.

As far as cars go. Ive seen a car that had been bonnet deep in flood water for near 2 years. After it was dry enough to get to it, a buch of us made a day of getting to it , fushing the motor with clean water and deisel, fresh fuel and oil, and then thrashing the hellout of it the rest of the day to clear the rust out. Last time i saw that car it was a daily driver still going strong.

As a new player myself, i KNEW from about my third day in the game that i was going to play through the storyline and quit straight after due to the server problems mainly, but also all the other bugs and random problems the game has.

Anyone coming from other games will instantly see the performance and server problems, hell, the game doesnt even give smooth play at 120fps, it still looks jittery. The first half dozen times you explode from skills not activating you think you may have misspressed, but when it becomes aparent that most of the time your key presses seem to just not register, you start to get pretty pissed off.

As far as the content goes. Its actually the steady stream of relatively good content, and ongoing story telling that has made me stay as long as i have, and why i put any money into the game at all. 

The devs making the content really shouldn't see most of the bitterness direced towards them. People just want the underlying problems, that are getting worse and worse, to be fixed, so when they see a big chunk of new content they get bitter that the effort looks to be going towards the wrong things. Big expensove packs like this new one end up being seen as cash grabs, they feel like the devs are trying to squeeze money out of them and trying to distract from the big problems with shiny treats.

Las night, my bind for toggling shooter mode was, toggling shooter mode, crouching, engaging autorun, and turning my character and locking it facing back towards me with all movement controls subsiquently reversed. What in the actual fuck!

Change character didnt fix, it carried over to others, which shouldnt happen at all, ever. Relog didnt fix it, restart didnt fix it, reloading controls with /bind command didnt help at all. It finally came good after spamming map changes until the game crashed.

Ive had similar things happen more than a dozen times. Its different every time, and it seems completely random what needs to be done to fix it sometimes. The majority of the time the /bind works luckily so I make sure to keep my saved keybinds updated.

Id face those 2 front EP forward, even if it means you need to space the smg out more so they clear. Right now those 2 EP can both be taken out by destroying 1 block between them, makimg them basically useless. Turn them and swap sides then have the blocks that they connect to not directly connected to any of the blocks on the outside of the bot.

You should be mounting weapons in the same way. The connecting block and at least the next block in, should be completely covered by a layer of blocks without being connected to them. This is very basic triforcing technique and will make a huge difference to your bot.

Having an EP directlycomnected to the weapon connecting block like you have out on the wings is a good way to tank rail shots, making sure the damage doesnt spread inwards. This is more useful on something with good redundency though, which you dont have. Triforcing would serve you mich better i think.",2016-04-25 13:30:11+00:00,d2ghn8g,1.0,t3_4g8koh,79130,Robocraft

Scroll down to general concepts. This will give you the basics, you can do lots more with some research and some thought to what you want to do. I recommend just setting it up exactly like the guide and play for a while. It wont take long and youll start figuring out what you want to change. Its worth taking the time then to set it up to do exactly what you want it to. Pretty much if yoi can think of it, it can be done. Google  first, if you cant find it aske more questions, someone will know how to do it or where you can find the more detailed guides.

Its not the keybinds so much that increase dps. The keybinds just make it easier to keep rotations and buffs going, you dont have to remember so many keys and timings, just hit one key every couple seconds.

 for most ppl it will increase dps. For very few ppl it could decrease dps because of the way the initial activations work, or so ive read. The biggest thing it changes for me in my squushy lil escort was survivability. Once i didnt have to keep track of so many abilities just to keep damage going it allowed me to concentrate on hitting my active defences and heals at the right time.",2016-04-17 23:20:27+00:00,d26vakr,1.0,t3_4f8wri,1909,stobuilds

726,"You are gonna get told over and over taht DPS is all that matters endgame. While it is true that dps matters alot endgame, it is not the only consideration.

When my tac and sci captains both still had the same lvl of gear, my tac was doing 15-20k dps while my sci was only capable of parsing 3-5k dps. However, for all story and other solo content, my sci captain was able to both kill enemies faster, and in missions requiring other things be protected, my sci was way more capable of 100% success.

But lets look at this from another angle.

Were I to put my tac captain in the same ship as my sci cap, run all the same boff abilities and the same skill build as my sci cap, it would perform almost exactly the same. The only difference would be that I wouldnt have access to photonic fleet, instead I would have access to attack pattern alpha to replace that firepower. The main difference between the two being that with attack pattern alpha, I would have direct control over where that firepower is going and would be drawing aggro to myself, with photonic fleet, I would be drawing less aggro from that power, but I dont have much control over where it is going.

Personally, I dont enjoy playing my tac captain very much and I wish Id started as sci first so she would have all the good gear now. The reason... Ground combat... Playing a sci captain is just way more fun for me in ground missions. When Im debuffing enemies and healing team mates occasionally I feel im contributing more than I would be just shooting stuff. I like the AOE abilities and the ability to not instantly die when I get focussed by a boss.
Tac can do some of the same stuff too though, it just works differently.

Eng is amasing fun for solo ground combat when you can dictate how fast you are moving along. In multiplayer combat it feels a little limited since alot of your power comes from stationary constructs.

Basically it all comes to this. If you want to get to the top 10% of the DPS league, you are going to need a tac captain due to haw attack pattern alpha works and its interraction with cooldown reductions.

If you arent interrested in epenis size, then play whatever you have the most fun with in ground combat. Any career can be made to play very much the same as the others in space.

741,"Sometimes you just get bad matches like that where iy seems the entire enemy team is designed specifically to destroy you and only you. It happens dont worry too much about it.

Dont over extend. This meand dont put yourself in a position where you will have that manay guns looking at you. If you have to expose yourself, wait for your team, wait for the fight to start. 

Sometimes you can use yourself as a distraction though to give your team an advantage as the fight starts. Pop your self over a hill and fire a few shots just as your team come around the corner then get back to cover fast

Always have a plan. Wven if you are chasing down a crippled bot to finish it off, plan ahead to where you will bug out to if 3 enemy come round the corner. Make ise of terrain, fly accross the gap between 2 hills, have your aim ready to go before you hit open air, you can fire of your barrage and immediately be behind the next hill.

Speed, manuverability. The faster and more mobole your bot is the easier it is to dodge flack or to duck behind cover before they get missile lock. Always having a plan helps this too, know where cover is at all times, practice evasive manuvers till they are automatic when you see or hear flack.

Build. Build in a way that important parts are not the first thing destroyed by flack in particular. With regen now a thing its quite viable to sacrifice weapons to maintain mobility so yoi can regen and get back to the fight. Let your bot get hit by loml a few times from different angles. Work out exactly where they are hitting you and add an extra triforce layer so you can tank a hit.

Learn the range of loml and protos. Often you can avoid them and waste the enemies energy bar by sitting at the edge of range.

Flack. Change direction often. Ive had matches against lots of flack where i havnt even needed to take cover.

Loml. Range as already suggested. If you cant get cover or range, turn toward the missile at the last second. Not directly at it, but in its general direction. You can also waste a tiny amount of its range by spiraling(not confirmed but it seems to help).

Protos. If you are primarily electroplatws then...panic and run away. If not, laugh at them while you take careful aim and blow them out of existence.

748,"Adding my vote for depth to existing game play before adding fps. Id rather they didnt bother with fps ever and kept it ship based. Stop trying to match star citizen, they are differnt games, let them be different.

2 things the game badly needs imo.

Proper criminal tracking abd bounty hunting system. We need to be able to track someone accross colonised space. Have the nav beacons track who comes through and stations log activity for us to look over. Give us a way to access this onfo so we can see whose been there. Im not aaying simply tell is where they are headed, thats too easy, but itd be noce to jump into a system, check if oit mark has been there, then we could use our heads to narrow down where they might have gone and jump to neghboring austems to check. Something needs to happen to make it easier to track criminals and collect their bounties.

Missions. The game still doesnt have some of the most obvious mission types weve come to expect from these sprts of games. Two that come to my head immediately are escort and pirate base assault. The game already has the perfect mechanic in place to be able to have these missions placed semi randomly. We simply have to find the coordinates and drop into a custom made instance with your target/client. That instance doesnt hqve to pre exist for anyone else, ony has to leave a wake behind for others to follow. With pirate bases in particular, i just find it illogical that we kill possibly millions of them every day yet they have no hidden base of opperations. Sure theres a few scattered outposts but they could hardly support the numbers we deal with, not to mention the amount of anacondas that have nowhere to go.

I really like the idea of a better damage model too now that its been mentioned. One of the best parts of IL2 was taking damage to a wing/engine/tail, and having to keep fighting or try and escape while damaged, with the handling of your plane based on what is damaged. I would love to see a simplified version of that in ED. I know we can tale out sub systems, but nothing really affects handling in incriments. It would be awesome to see someone having to turn nose down instead of nose up because of thruster damage, or not being able to roll one direction very well. It would !ake even pve fights much more interresting if we could sustain this sort of damage. Pvp would be so much more unpredictable and exciting. I was always so happy to make a safe landing in IL2 with a heavily damaged plane. Imagine how tense and exciting it would be landing at a space station without reverse thrust, or with all manuvering thrusters only opperating at 5%. Heck, at that point you wouldnt need pvp anymore, pve alone would be exciting enough.",2016-04-10 18:29:47+00:00,d1xim11,1.0,t3_4e6qh3,2722,EliteDangerous

Right now there are a couple T5 upgradable ships under the 10mill EC limit youd be able to buy. The upgrade tokens themselves are around 15 mill, but im certain youd be able to find a fleet mate willing to take a few instalments to pay for one and buy for you. This gives you a Ship with similar stats to a T6 without spending any real money. 20mill Ec isnt really that hard to get either, after you get to max lvl simply do a bit of research and youll have it in no time. Just have to keep the 10mill cap in mind. 

Honestly though if you think 2 months is alot of work then maybe mmos are not for you :) Mmos are almost always grind heavy, you are expected to keep playing them for a long time. Also with a ftp model like STO has, its the fact that lots of farming is needed that keeps them in business, it encoureges you to shortcut and buy stuff and thats what they want. On that topic though, at least in STO you can simply farm for something you want. I have friends who spent years of organising and leading 12 man raids nearly every day waiting for a loot drop and never got it. Of farming the same hour long quest dozens of times a week with the same result. Farming is considered a luxury among some gamers.

Seriously though, the game is fun enough to be worth playing through the storyline at the very least. Just do that to start using the gear available as mission rewards.

782,"Its too late man. FJ have started down a path and its doubtful they will ever turn back around.

They fucked up the moment they started introducing entire new weapons to the game just to balance a single bot type, instead of just reducing the HP of the blocks that were causing the problem.

They continued to fuck up when they continued to make weapons that were direct counters to certain bots, but making those weapons prohibitively expensive for a large percentage of players.

They should have just left it as a nice clean trilogy that made it easy to balance everything around them.

Remember the good ol days when you still had a chance against a bot with more firepower by stalking them or out manuvering them to get close enough to hurt them.. Those days are gone now the devs put aimbots in the game.

This brings me to another problem. Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to remove the fucking fog?! Has it occurred to anyone that these new weapons and combos wouldnt be so retarded if those using them could only see as far as they used to? They wouldnt be able to sit mid map like they do. They would actually have to move a little bit, and what does this do? It opens up opportunities to flank them and kill thier 1 side armored ass! Theres a reason wallcopters werent a big problem much sooner than they were, because it was easy to sneak around behind them. NOW...They dont even need to make the wall big anymore, they can make it tiny and 5 times as thick cause they can see and control the entire map as soon as they get the slightest advantage.

On top of all this, they remove hitscan from rails and smg....

Did nobody stop to think that maybe those complaining about hitscan weapons were THE ONES FLYING THE TESSERACTS! Seriously, tesseracts werent even a problem before then. They didnt need much done to balance them, if anything. And a hp decrease on the blocks responsible would have been an end to the matter. Now hitscan is gone they sure as shit are a problem!

Id also like to add to OP that I think damage propagation is the single most logical mechanic I have seen in a game. Nearly every person on the planet is taught how water travels through pipes and electricity travels through wires. The very first thing I learned in robocraft when I got a better weapon than the starters is that if I hit a weaker block with it, it can destroy the block next to it as well.

794,"Not the match itself that was epic, but the moment when you realise you might have made the perfect bot.

I think it was the first bot i built after the game went to blocks all being the same, it was certainly before loml were introduced. I was actually really peeved at losing t10.1 blocks since my compact bomber was near unkillable, but i decided to give it a chance.

The build was a lightweight sled, thrusters only and a single rudder for stability when i need to get airbourne. Its built around circle straffing the enemy, basically running circles around them at high speed, keeping the front facing them to maximise weapon coverage and armor tanking. I wasnt completely done with damage routing but id been building and testing the thing for 4 hours or more already and wanted to see how it played, see if it was worth the time.

I straight up rushed the enemy cause i wanted to see how tough it was. I caught them in open ground before they got to the tower, nice flat wide space, perfect for the bots playstyle. I went to work on them, running pefect circles, barely having to adjust my aim. There was 5 of them i think, maybe 6. The armor layers were perfect, they peeled away nicely, even after a couple plasma hits i had most of my core functioning. I took all thier guns off, then took a breath and finished several off before a couple team mates wandered in to help clean up.

I was down to 3 guns, sticking out of the core like a mangled insect but i still had full control and as the respawns came in to reap revenge on my heavily damaged, retarded self, i tapped space bar and hit the skies. She flew straight and true over the cliff into the valley and over the other side to safety. One fast bot followed me but i had designed it to run away safely from precicely these stupid situations i get myself into. I made it to my shield and i guess he figured hed come this far, might as well go for the kill. I just survived long enough for a team mate to spawn and save me.

As i healed up, i took stock of the situation. I was OC 6 or 7 at around 1.5 minutes in and the enemy hadnt taken a tower. Only a few of the enemy had got to OC 2. Match didnt last long, and i didnt get lots of kills or a big score, just the satisfaction that my bot was possibly as close to perfect as it was going to get. I havnt changed it at all to this day except for swapping over to curved inners.

812,"I used the alien type to clone my romulan into starfleet.

After having her mind toyed with by the tal shiar, she felt he sanity slipping away. Nightmares of killing her friends over and over and seeing entire worlds destroyed by the weapons she helped create. Having just endured a day and night of near overwhelming urge to self destruct the ship, she slipped away in the shuttle whuile the night crew share a light ale and stories of their recent battles. For an engineer of her skill, leaving un noticed was no problem. The hardest part was making certain not to encounter any crew while moving about, her hands were itching to make use of the plasma pistol hanging off her combat belt, it was set to kill and she was not sure she would have enough contrl over her self to leave anyone she encountered alive.

With the newly formed alliences it was not overly difficult to secure transport to earth. Humans are known to let member of their own race, and others, to do as they please, perhaps if she cpul find somewhere far away from others she could live without tirning anyone into a scattering puff of green mist.

She had begun to find it theraputic, literally. This place was unlike anything she had ever seen, and wandering the trails day after day helped keep at bay the need to inflict purposeful pain on another intelligent life form. Reaching a clearing, she stopped to take in her surroundings, to pick which direction she might take if nothing caught her eye first. Rising to fill the sky in front of her was a mountain, which seemed to be the focal point of the deliberately placed clearing. El Capitan according to the small infogram sitting atop it's discreet pedestal. Raising her chin to get a good look at the supposed ""attraction"", she noticed several figures making their way slowly up the rock face, she knew immediately where she wanted to be and smiled for the first time in many months.

”Fascinating isnt it” came comically weak voice from beside her, bringing her back to the moment, back to the ground. ""Those are humans up there arent they"" she asksed ""why do such frail creatures decide to climb to such a height, surely they understand they cannot survive a rapid decsent?"" ""The same reason you just decided to i suppose, because it is there"". The simple answer hit home and for the first time she felt she understood, just a little, how humans may have in fact made it to the stars by themselves centuries ago. In another first, at least since escaping the tal shiar, she continued the conversation instead of shying away from fear of herself. ""Come Vulcan, climb with me"" she offered. ""As i am here to understand human, recreation, yes, let us climb the mountain, and see this place from another perspective"". Without another word the two headed up the trail at a light run, within the hour they were at the base of the cliff and began to climb without a second thought or stopping to rest.

On a narrow ledge high above the valley floor, the two sat talking. Conversation had stayed on pleasentries while climbing, but now as they sat taking on fluids, both of them felt a connection forming and began to open up. ""Ki'inna"", she spat out, realising that introductions had been skipped entirely. ""Ki'inna is my name"". Without turning his head from the view in front of him,  the Vulcan raised his hand with the traditional Vulcan greeting, "" I am T'relan, retired Starfleet officer, well met Ki'inna"". ""Well met T'relan. Shall we return to you research? This meagre ledge may not be the best place to spend the night"".

The two returned to the mountain the next day. And the next, and the next. For weeks they returned, most days climbing the mountain, some watching others prepare for, and begin their climb. Every day they spoke of their lives and adventures. T'relan speaking of his century with starfleet and Ki'inna telling the tale of her simple life in the colony and eventually of the invasion, and everything since then.

"" I believe i can be of some assistance to you"", T'relan offered one day as he ignored the hand holds he had used the week previous and leaped several metres past it to another. Ki'inna let the statement sit a while as she analised her own ascent options, both from memory, and from what could be seen around her. Knowing T'relan would not make such an offer without a great deal of contemplation, she was intrigued as to what he might have in mind, but did not want to get distracted during this critical point in her climb with two diverging pathways. She was nearly a century younger than T'relan, but he had quickly overtaken her physical capabilities and she could not make the seemingly impossible jumps he made to switch lines as he pleased. Before Ki'inna answered, he continued. ""I could mind meld with you"" he said as he made another leap to a hold she knew she could not reach. ""By looking back through your memories of this last year, i am confident i will be able to recognise which of them are planted or staged, and which are real. With time, and working together, we may be able to then make those memories seem as if they are experiences with a view screen or a holo novel rather than seming like they are your own thoughts and actions.""

Without hesitation, Ki'inna decided which line she would take up the moutain that day, and began to climb, the ledge they had found the day they met was mere minutes away. ""Follow me"" she called to the sky as she took the same shortcut T'relan had taken moments ago, and breazed hast him making use of the easier section to overtake.

Sitting on the narrow ledge again, Ki'inna worked through the breathing and meditation excercises T'relan had been teaching her. When he decided she was ready, T'relan reached up beside him and positioned hiss hand for the mind meld. The positioning was arkward, but not overly difficult to get correct, once he was ready he began the meld. ""My mind, to your mind"".

......

And thats where im up to on the character. Ive started 2 more characters the same. One romulan as a sci instead of engi, im playing through the sci as the reliving memories bit, and to see how a science romulan plays. And the second is an alien that ive made to look exactly the same with the federation. Plan is to have her see how the federation works through a series of mind melds that help her get her mind right. She decides she wants to help re unite romulans and vulcans and through this have the romulans join the federation, she thinks the best way to help would be from within starfleet. She enlists with the help and referal of T'relan. I think im pretty close to where the storyline stops being different, then illstart play on the fed alien persona.

The combination of the(spoiler alert) tal shiar mind control and its removal that sent her insane, and then piecing her past back together with T'relan's help, ends up changing her so much that she doesnt feel like the same person, so she changes her name too.

Ive been having a heap of fun with this series of characters so far. Writing up logs as i go through missions and trying to give verbal commands to my crew when using boff abilities. Yes if anyone sees me talking at my pc they may think im going crazy. And yes it took me HOURS to make the character look exactly the same, but it was totally worth it to get so much more storyline while keeping with the same ""character"".",2016-03-27 20:11:00+00:00,d1fjv73,1.0,t3_4c3nth,70301,sto

I did take a shortcut when there was the bonus zen sale immediately followed by a ship sale. Even then, i only did it cause i knew i wanted to play through the storyline with nothing but the defiant.

By making the side mounting holes of the movable piece smaller than the screws being used, you can do them up very tight without stripping the plastic out. Combine this with the parts fitting closely together, and that alone should be enough to hold the camera angle in most situations. If there is excess vibration expected then a piece of bicycle tyre inner tube cut to act as a washer would certainly make it enough.

858,"Allowing missions to start solo is only logical imo. Adding the failure conditions back in for anyone playing solo would stop everyone from just running them solo instead of queueing  like they do now, and allow people to properly challenge themselves.

Im a new player and the fact we cant fail advanced content just seems weird to me. The only challenge in sto is trying to do things faster. Coming from games where anything could be attempted solo, and everything could be failex, to sto where a single celled organism could succeed end game content is actually a little deppressing to see.

DDO for instance, you can enter even end game quests solo, but they are fucking hard and unless you are god damn amazing youre gonna fail. By being able to fail, it encouraged finding a party and working together so there was always ppl running them. But once you were geared and had a good build you had the option of trying to do it solo for the challenge. STO i feel could really benefit from being able to challenge yourself like this. I die a little inside every time i enter a mission with my unfinnished torp boat and find the reat of the team are even worse than my sorry arse, yet we still complete it. Hell, in ddo you could do 12 man raids solo if you could get there and open it.

I actually feel that aolo questing would really suit sto. Not only would it fit with the 1 ship against the galaxy, that is the theme of most star trek, but your ability activations would be more reliable due to less debuffs and hence less lag. Think about how bad the breach is, for me its basically like winning the lottery if any of my abilities work on the first half dozen presses. Imagine not only the challenge of taking it on by yourself, but knowing you could accomplish greater feats because your boffs do as they are told in a timely manner.

Tldr. Sto should allow missions to be done solo, but with harsh failure conditions to avoid people farming them solo, so queueing is still encouraged.",2016-03-13 14:32:10+00:00,d0y7vfj,1.0,t3_4a6b8p,49535,sto

870,"In terms of game play yoire not really missing much. Some of the queues are really fun but ultimately its still the same shooting stuff.

For me there 2 things that are great about multiplayer games and mmos. 

1st is the randomness. For example, sto has a fairly rare thing in that in a purely pve environment, ots still possible to kill each other through splash damage or by exploding. I like to fly my rom toon into grav welled groups and drop my singularity followed by a rear torp spread. The amount of times while levelling that someone has had more dps than i thought and ive been caught in the middle of 8 exploding ships is hillarious. Super satisfying when you manage to survive through quick thinking too. One of my favourites was exactly that, id survived and hit cloak while it was clear for a second so i wouldnt get more agro. Almost the exact moment my shield dropped, a team mate exploded just out of camera view and took me out.  Competative games like call of duty etc are the best example of the randon factor. Playing through a single player story will usually give you the same result over again, a multiplayer competative game will never be the same thing twice.

2nd thing, is just shooting the shit. Even just joining a bunch of chat channels is great(taking care to set them all different colours of course). Thousands of people who enjoy the same shit you do, often with the same sense of humor, and always someone willing to help out. This is especially great for people who tend to get burned out on games, cause so often you end up realising youe been in space dock for 2 hours having 5 different conversations at the same time. Or youve stopped to type to someone between each of your dilithium mining nodes and it doesnt feel like a geind at all.

Sto is a little frustrating on the chat side of things since it has a habbit of wiping your chat window on map changes. The benefits out way that small frustration though and its well worth the time to jump into a new channel when you find oit about it.

They dont need to come up with a new texture for every instance ffs, if they want to be lazy then copy paste the good quality ones that work. At least then people can actually play the content. When you go from 120 fps through the rest of the game, to 10 fps in those systems, its just bad optimising and straight up lazy of them to let it stay like it is.

They arenabout to overhaul the skill system, when they do, all your skills will be reset. So dont worry about your character being messed up right now.

Use the time between now and then to mess around with the game and figure out what you enjoy most. You can always jump onto am escort and see if you like it, there will be almost no difference to what it would be like with a tac character. For noobs like us there is almost no difference between the careers in space combat, all the difference comes in how they play on the ground.

I would say everyone has trouble when they encounter the borg. Im certain its intentional, since the borg are supposed to be this great scary threat, it would be silly if we were to roll over them like we do everything else to that point. Encountering the borg seems like a brick wall you cant get past at first, but the difficulty jump is there to prepare you for end game. It foeces you to look at your build and your play, and figure out what is good and bad, or what works for you. By the time you are done with the borg you will have a much deeper understanding about the game mechanics and what sort of abilities there are and what they do.

My noob tip on the borg. Dont waste your shield heals, they will just drain it fast anyway. Save them for when one of their plasma torps is about to hit. Those torps will fuck you up of they hit hull but are not so bad if you have a bit of shield in the way.

On the firing arc. Ive been using C:SV solidly since the Defiant class got battle cloak(that was when I could afford the doffs needed). I have very rarely run into situations where I cant maintain fire on a large group for the majority of the timer. I understand this is different for those using PTtM, but then if we were allowed to use cannons in the rear this wouldnt be so much of a problem either, you could blow right on past and still have the skill going as you fly away.

While for me, this means free rp, it cant be fun for the low lvl players. How woukd you feel if your first day/evening playing the game you had encountered a bot that was literally several thousand time more powerful than yours.

The second thing is the LOML... Hang on bear with me..

There os a serious discrepency between what the target sees on thier screen  vs what is happenning/where the missiles really are. When they first came out it didnt seem to be a problem, if it was it wasnt very noticable. Now ots utterly horrible, every game you have to deal with these magic ninja missiles.

STFs seem to be set up so they are damn near impossible to fail, imo this is retarded because it encourages people to join advanced and elite before they are capable.

What you can, and will fail though, are bonuses/optional objectives, that give extra marks. By joining advanced queues before you are ready, you are costing others their bonus marks.

Whatever though, might as well keep doing what you are doing cause every other asshole does it. The polite thing though would be to at least understand the mission objectives of a particular mission before doing it advanced. Too big a percentage of people think theres nothing to do in an Advanced stf but sit 9.5k from a fight so they can keep their shield at 100%, and never assist with objectives. Dont be that guy and youll be more useful than half the ppl i see.

I dont quite know how your getting only 3k dps with mk xii greens on board. Look in https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds for cheap beam boat builds. You might only need a couple minor changes to build and play style to double your dps. 

You dont need to copy complete builds, but look into why they work. Making sure youre using the most appropriate Doffs and Boff actives for your build will make a surprising difference. Usually youll already have the ones you need, they dont need to be purple or anything.

As far as gearing up. Again, look for cheap gear options in stobuilds. There are decent builds you can make almost entirely out of episode rewards. Im a new player myself and I had a couple runs near 20k dps on my AP build made from rewards.

Keep grinding Rep And Fleet Marks in the mean time, its where alot of your gear will come from later.

If you want an easy way to judge how much youve improved, just use this http://www.stoacademy.com/tools/combatlog.php Dont have to install anything, just follow the instructions. Use the foundry mission ""Battlefield Royale Rumble"" right now with the log running to get your baseline, you might want to practice the mission a couple times first so you get more accurate result. You can rerun it with no cool down so its a pretty decent way of seeing if a change makes a big difference. Its not a perfect gauge, but its pretty good for us newbies.

Personally I dont think anyone should start doing Advanced queues until they can crack 10k dps in a solo mission, but at least half the ppl I see when I run the log in queues are 5k or lower. ALTHOUGH, some missions, dps doesnt seem to matter that much as long as you understand what you need to do.

Having to lock the points in as you go just seems like a very obvious way to get more sales on respec tokens.

I know this is just testing but this seems like a pretty big fail as it makes it extremely difficult to actually test. Basically you have to have respec tokens available before you even transfer to the test server.",2016-02-26 08:49:57+00:00,d0eea6v,1.0,t3_46n12a,557797,sto

If you have tonns of EC and plan to go all out then (pen) is still king. After that it seems (dmg) and (crtd)are on equal footing as long as you already have vuln locators. If you dont have locators, and wont have them soon you may be better pff with (crth) instead of (crtd).

Agony might be nice but only if you find them cheap, or want to squeeze every bit of damage you can. But if you were squeezing for damage you wouldnt want phasers anyway. None of the 2.5% chance procs are really any good on cannons because they only have that chance per cycle, not per shot like beams do during FAW. A heavy contributor to the unpopularity of cannons.

If youre light on in the EC department then it's pretty easy to get enough dil and fleet creadits for fleet weapons, but you most likely better off saving those fledits for vulnrability locators instead, they make a huge difference to your damage. Fleet weapons are really noce and can handle end game, but if you plan on maxing your damage any time soon then you can skip them and get so e nice crafted weapons.

I found the Quantum Phase set really nice for phasers. The console has phaser damage so it makes up for one of the slots you use for the Battle cloak set. There might be better options I havnt found but its an easy set to get and costs nothing but time, and damage is pretty good.

The wide arc DHC really help make use of the extra scatter volley duration from the T6 Valiant trait. It keeps at least a bit of fire on those that sneak out of your firing arc.

That site has 2 main advantages i use it for. I can log in on other computers and get my files easily, good because i print away from home. And its really fast and easy to use when making simple objects, and i can copy paste parts from one file to another. So i can build a whole project then just copy parts individually for printing.

Id just print it with the mating surfaces flat on the bed/float. As long as you keep your temp stable to avoid warping that would give you the best result.

Believe me ive really thought hard about interlocking sections for this design. Ive experimented with intetlocking for strength and as locator tabs and its quite frankly really really hard to make them work right. Several problems. When dealing with small parts like this the locators almost never hold thier shape properly at the edges they iether warp or kind of droop out of shape. You also have to have a float when you print, this raises the main mating face of one half and does 2 things. That half wont have a nice flat surface for glueing, and having a float, or a higher float than would otherwise be needed, it opens up to more chance of warping. Particularly when you plan to glue something together, the idea is to get the best mating surface as possible, then you wont need interlocking for strength because the glued section should be just sa strong as the bond between the printed layers anyway.

Hope i explained that well enough. Tldr, its a pain in the ass and a flat surface is way easier to print.

If i get pics of an antenna sitting inside one half though id know where to either add ziptie holes on the sides, or maybe even reshape it to allow for them if needed. Failing that i could add tabs on the sides for zipties, but that looks dirty so id rather not :)

First preference for me would be the mirror universe patrol escort. Its a lockbox ship and can be found on the exchange for around 2million EC. Its a decent ship and can be made to look pretty good. Im not sure its stats are much better than the t4 but they are better... I just realised i dont have a clue if you need to be fed to use this ship or not, i assume you do.

Second choice would be either the meshweaver if you want science focus or the nihydron destroyer if you want tactical. They are both pretty good ships and can be had cheap on the exchange too.

If you want to stick to your factions ships there will be a t5 ship available for fleet credits maybe a couple options. Start running  multiplayer queues, middle button at the bottom of your minimap. Do ones that offer a choice of marks, or fleet marks, take the fleet mark reward from those with a choice. Once you have a good amount of fleet marks, start adking around for fleets that need marks dumpped to fill out projects. You need 200000 fleet credits for the ship, youll find it in the normal starship vendor.

Beyond those, you are gonna need to either turn a buttload of dil into zen, or youre gonna need the EC cap upgrade to get the more expensive ships off the exchange.

Here it is with a 2.6mm hole. Not sure if printers still tend to fill in the hole a bit or if they account for the width of the bead now, ive been out of the game 12 months or so, easy enough to change.


https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jvv7Q3r8Y8q-58-clover-leaf-cover-48mm-wire 4.9mm hole for 4.8mm wire. Again, if its not a nice tight fit around the wire its easy enough for me to change.

Its just a line up manually and glue together job atm, I never got around to deciding on the best way to locate the 2 halves. Ive left it vertical in the design for ease of copying and altering, should be easy enough to put it flat face down in  your choice of printer software.

I can see what might be the result of them changing how the program works a little. No big issue, just a couple grams un needed weight. Ill see if I can neaten it up sometime.

Actually, if someone prints one of these, could you please maybe post or PM me a pic of the antenna sitting inside one half? It might really help since I think I made it bigger than it needs to be. Might be able to trim it down a little in places.

EDIT. Ive put together some options to  hold these together with zip ties top and heatshrink over the bottom. Thanks u/rotarypower101 for the idea.  Im not sure if the version with 2 zip ties will foul on the antenna so it might be best to start with the 1 ziptie version. The zip tie holes should be a nice tight fit for 2.5mm ties.

Thats the main reason anyway. Id love someonr to prove me wrong, but its doubtful anyone will risk thier 100k numbers be put in dispute by letting slip what they can actually do solo.

Second reason, and its actually a pretty big reason, is that there just isnt anywhere in the game to actually test properly once you start getting the higher numbers. Id guess once you reach 20-30k theres no solo content that will have a combination of fast enough spawns and enemy tough enough to withstand more than half a volley. With everything dieing so fast and taking so long to spawn, your never going to see full dps possible since youd be wasting most of the potential of each skill you pop and the majority of your fire.

For us mere mortals theres a couple places we can go. The best ive found are ""Battleship Royale Rumble"" foundry mission, and the Voth deep space encounters in the delta quadrant when theres not many people around. If anyone has any better suggestions I would LOVE to hear them since i like a good solo challenge.

Ive found that once I started getting around 10k in those was when i started getting agro in almost every queue i play, thats in an escort with as much -agro as i know how to get.

I now get around 12k in those and hold agro in almost every mission i play, the biggest exception being CC advanced, theres almost always someone that doubles my dps in there. 

To give a very basic idea of what is achievable with 12k... I can easily handle a lane solp in borg disconnected on normal, but would have to be playing at the top of my game just to survive a lane solo in advanced.

Im also behind those who have been saying for a long time that CQC should be free to play with advertising for the main game in the background of the lobby.

Move the mouse by moving youe forearm forwards and backwards. Your movement will be naturally limited by how much give there is in the ball of your hand, mouse sensitivity should be set up so that either end of this limit is barely outside the top and bottom edges of yhe minigame.

This combined with following advice others have already given might make it worth you while.
For me, setting my game up like this for farming made me instantly go from getting 7-800 per scan, to getting over 2000 every single time, usually 2400, fairly often getting a flawless run. Yup, getting it running smoothly makes that much difference.

Using a real mouse is mandatory too. If you are getting 900 points on a trackpad, you are already superman.

Just realised i didnt answer your question.

Yes its worth playing the minigame, you are sitting there waiting for the timer anyway, so might as well try for more traces. Personally i think 1700 is a goot score to aim for, that gives you a sliver, which if you plan on crafting alot of upgrades, will save you a bunch of r&amp;d time. Getting those real high scores makes the value of the time you spend so much higher though. Csnt remember the cutoff point, but at some point you are getting 3 traces and a sliver, so 6 tomes the amount of just waiting it out. Also seems like you have a higher chance of getting a shard or fragment with higher score too, but not sure, those drops could just be random. 

So even if you are not getting great scores, its worth playing. Even if you never play enough to craft a single upgrade, the amount of ec you can sell the traces for is pretty great compared to how much time it takes to get them. I would guess ive earned close to 30mill ec with just a couple sessions of farming.",2016-02-02 01:24:49+00:00,czkfkvh,1.0,t3_43o2fa,50110,sto

In graphics tab, manually set everything to low or off, except..

* texture anisotropic filtering to either 2x or 4x if your rig can handle it. This isnt much of a performance sacrifice and leaves you still having nice textures.

* All 3 detail distance settings to high, if your rig can handle it. These settings make no difference in frame rate for me but avoids pop in effect.

Then in the Display tab, use the slider to lower

* resolution scale

until you find a compromise between performance and looks.

Once all applied and ok. Press escape again to bring up menu, and click on rearrange HUD. Click ""Hide"" on any HUD elements that are not absolutely vital. So, once you have all your hotbars et up for your ship, the Boff abilities can go. The XP bar can go. Theres some little extra boxes that are never used, they gone. I get rid of the mission tracker too, cause I can just use the mision window and map to check what I need to do. The UI in this game sucks alot of frame rate, so anything you get rid of will really help.

On my rig, i can leave resolution scale at max and get around 80-100fps. Then when I drop into one of the badly optimised systems i can just quickly drop the slider to bring frame rate up.

It takes time to balance though, and i imagine youd lose some durability if designed to maintain balance when damaged.

The tesseract drones you see everywhere are really a rush build that's made for durability and to dominate the meta as early as possible. I guarantee ome of the original builders has a verion that is perfectly balanced and still just as durable, and it undoubedly took him many hours to build and was refined to work better over the course of countless matches.

Make a rectangle 1 block height, 1 block thick sides.  Fill the middle with helium+blocks to the required boyancy. Couple thrusters on the sides, steering thrusters on the back. All of it confined in that single block height.

It will stay nice and flat as it turns.

Now you can add blocks and parts mirroring each other top and bottom, side to side and it will keep its nice handling.

It works fine with plasmas, very slightly less bllanced when hitting rough terrain at high speed but doesnt take long to learn to handle this. It doesnt seem to lose much, if any, speed.

If you are going to sit back and take potshots, this is not the bot for you, it cant peak over terrain like a hover can. Its made for getting right up close and drifting sideways in a circle around your enemy with your nose facing them. Use side to side movements to spread damage once EPs pop though. You need to learn when you have taken enough damage and use your speed to get out of dodge to regen and come back to the fight.

I was actually surprised how well plasmas suited this play style, it works pretty well. Personally i feel the loss of power against flying units isnt worth the bit of extra power plasmas give you on the ground. If youre gonna play a ground plasma unit though, now is the time i suppose, with so many less drones in the sky.

Since you have to have to be in the top half of the scoreboard to maintain tour rank if you lose. When it looks like there is any chance you might lose, your anly real option is to switch to farm mode to boost your score and maybe not lose rank.

I feel like theres been many times where it could have been a close mtch, and maybe even a comeback win, but because the 2-3 better bots on the team have all switched to farming, then its only a matter of time until we are over run.

This comes down to the absolutely fucking retarded decicion to have the scores doubled for the winning team. Without that ass fuck of a mechanic, matches would be much closer because the better players/bots would naturally maintain thier rank just by playing well and trying to win.

Ive just given up on league until they fix that crap, its not helpful to anyone. I had given up on the game entirely before they brought back unrankked arena. Now i just play my game and have fun rather than stressing about my rank. Without a doubt, the better way to play.

Youll have to set up and bind_save controls twice, one each for ground and space. Then load the setup twice, once each for ground and space.

Actually using the bind save command before doing anything else is an easy way to both create the file you want to be editing(though it sounds like you got that covered), and let you see if theres any overlapping keybinds. All you have to do is look down the list of keybinds the game has written, and make sure none of them are trying to do the same thing as you are trying to achieve with your additions.

Also, once you get your controls working the way you want them and bind_save them, make a backup of those 2 files. The game likes to occasionally change random controls or sometimes set them to default.

On the topic of items being deleted by selling a ship. There were items still equipped on 2 ships that were deleted.

Easiest to do is to just have 2 rows at the top of the screen for yours and your targets buffs etc. Can have the large enough for easily identifiable icons without getting in the way at all.

At no point do you need to see the buffs of your team members without directly targetting them, so that entire section can just be thrown in the trash.

The problem of the tiny icons was one of the first things I noticed when I got to content with debuffs being used by the enemy. Ther is no reasonable way to know wtf is going on, or how to counter it without memorising a hundred tiny icons that you can barely see even with 20/20 vision.

Ive played my fair share of mmo's over the last 10 years and i have never seen anything like the server lag this game has. 

On more than a dozen occasions ive had to abandon missions and walk away frrom the game when it has become unplayable mid mission. My character or ship being rooted on the spot, or bouncing from room to room is in no way enjoyable, and it happens on 2/3 missions at least. Most of the time i can wait it out but i could not count the times my crew has wiped from it.

This is on top of the hundreds of bugs and graphics glitches i deal with every time i play. Oh, the amount of missions one must complete without officers since they are having a circlejerk in a room or corridor somewhere, unable to find the door.

It is extremely lucky for cryptic, and i mean no offence saying this, that the community of this game does not have actual ""gamers"" as its majority playerbase.  This community is mainly star trek fans and the shear amount of those fans is the only reason the game survives. I say with certainty, if this game didnt have the most popular tv and movie series of all time as its base, it would be dead. Real gamers who actually see, and are annoyed by these problems would not, as a whole, stay long term playing something that has half the problems of sto. I sure as shit wont.

1123,"Talked about this amongst friends at length, not the cpmplainers but the long term developement.

We are not really happy with the way the game is right now, it is missing alot that someone expects from a space sim. It has pretty much 2 types of missions right now, and the trading economy is not really an economy at all rather than a random bunch of numbers. 

I personally feel like there should have been some sort of story campaign as well but have accepted thats not where they want to take it.

Does this mean im sorry i spent money on the game? Fuck no! It still fucking fantastic for what it is, if i want to fly around space and shoot fools there is no place id rather be. This game has the greatest feeling and immersive space combat mechanic ive experienced and if the game was nothing but that id still be happy with the money ive paid. Im a little sad its so hard to get into cqc matches still but that should keep improving with numbers. Honestly, id pay the money i did just for cqc.

Would i have preferred a more complete game? Yes. No reasonably intelligent long time gamer could argue that ED is a complete gane, but we would have had to wait an extra year or more for it to be released if itbwas going to be. Plus theres the risk they could have gone under in that time so i prefer they released when they did.

My friends and i are happy to sit and wait right now. ED has the potential to be one of the greatest games ever made imo, but its not there yet so it goes on the 2nd hard drive while i enjoy something else more complete. By the time ED becomes the game it should be, we are going to have affordable plug n play VR anyway so itll be godamn amazing then.

You have to look at the complainers as people who love the game for what it could be but are less patient than us. Deep down they probably really do know it will get there eventually but this is the instant gratification generation and they want what they paid for now. They have the illusion that if they get on thier keyboard and spout thier opinion that it will make things magically happen faster.

1132,"With actual airfoils it makes no difference which way they face, they perform the same.

With Rudders though, it makes a difference. Where they give their lift seems to be based on the block they are connected to.

Their connection point is off centre, so you can move the centre of lift backwards or forwards while keeping the hitbox of the rudder in the same place.

Example of why you might want them facing certain directions.

If you need your build to be very manuverable so you can dodge rail fire and you are not worried about taking damage from the rear, then you might have them facing backwards. this will allow tighter turns because the distance between front and rear lift points is longer.

If you need your bomber to survive alot of hits from the rear while running away from the enemy, and you are willing to compromise manuverability, then you might have them facing forwards. This puts their connection point farther forwards into the bot, making it harder for them to get blown off via their connecting blocks getting destroyed.

Theres other reasons to do it of course, this is just one example. To understand how it works, build a simple bot and experiment with moving the wings and rudders forwards and backwards, closer together and farther apart.

Also you seem to not understand that its not just the change in frame rate people see. A gpu is being stressed to hell if it is dropping fames that badly. This stress often causes the screen to freeze momentarily, most likely thos is what people are seeing, and it can cause bad eye strain if it is happening often enough. It is very much worth trying to eliminate this sort of thing. Capping frame rate is an easy way to ease the stress on the card and usually works well.

What sort of crazy person even tries to claim that screen tearing is undetectable. You are quite frankly out of your gourde. Almost any experienced gamer will find the most minimal screen tear to be infuriating and will do anything to get rid of it

Why even talk about straight lines in space. Straight lines are the place you are LEAST likely to notice screen tear. The same tear that can make an asteroid field look like two seperate images are barely noticable in the cockpit you claim will expose it.

If you want something pretty simple to get you started, you could try my T4 interceptor. With the current amount of bombers in the sky you should have fun with it. http://imgur.com/a/2h4FT  This build should work ok up to T7 amour and guns. Might just need to extend the gun mounts. 

EDIT. If you do copy this bot, add a block either side to bring the vertical rudders forward by one block. This allows them to work properly instead of against the wings for rolling. Using T5 thrusters for forward thrust will give better acceleration without too much RR increase. T6 thrusters fit fine for when you upgrade. T6 and 7 SMG should fit fine, just mount those on the nose farther forward.

EDIT. I realised how much I missed flying this thing. Updated it a bit and stuck it on the CRF. Search for Weapon X if you want to look at it to copy it easier.

Or find something you like on robocraft garage and copy that.

I just decided to mess around in my last match cause I was freezing and missing EVERY time I tried to fire. I flew around low amongst the enemy ball of bots, right in front of them when I could. In my small, fast bomber I was close to invincible.

Ive had matches where Im 8-10k damage above everyone in the match, BEGGING just one medic to come with me to end the match. 

No one wants to help me win so they all just sit in base and wait for the shield to come down and get over run, while im taking on half the enemy for tower control.

My last match for example. I was actually IN the enemy base, with a medic beside me. I know the enemy are all running shit bots so if the medic can either take the fire for 10 seconds, or last 30 seconds healing me, I can kill literally the entire enemy team.

Im shooting the tower and take fire. Turn to fight, and find the medic has just fucked off. Just gone, on his way back to our base.

I made a Human thief after seeing some vids/streams and instantly knew I was going to enjoy it all the way to 80.
I turned down settings of any bloom and effects I could so not so much blocks the character model, made the character slightly larger than I normally would, and gave the character a personality rather than just make her look as attractive as possible.

I made her to look as close as I could to Deborah and slaughtered Centaurs by the thousands in fits of blind rage. I made sure to take selfies with all the major npc characters and stuck them on a screen saver rotation. It may be a little over the top to do, but it really made me connect with the character.

In terms play style I found to be most enjoyable, I went with S/P-P/P. I use the sword skills to shadowstep around like mad during fights, ill  use in instead of dodge if i have time, and it feels like the xmen scene with nightcrawler dodging bullets.

Now, while i would LOVE rails to be nerfed, honestly if they were there would be no challenge for me in the macjority of games since other interceptors are so rare and i would just crush all other air units in 99% of matches with even less fear than i already have.

My most memorable and fun game in recent weeks was last night when there was 2 very well built, tanky rails on the enemy team both playing well, and i was in my bomber. F those two had been missing me and the other bomber on mu team, that match wouldn't have laste 5 minutes, the other bomber got 25 kills or more as it was.

Ill add my vote to making SMG a projectile weapon though,as suggested by others. I primarily play SMG an yhink they are a little too powerful against air units ftom long range. By that i mean only thrusters visible range. Its too often i cripple a bomber from accross the map with a dozen shots or so while they are spotted.

1305,"This is the right answer. 

Id like to add, both sleds and hovers have more potential in battle arena since the update that changed it to 3 towers instead of 4. Much better opportunities to flank enemies with your speed and maneuverability now that the main battles are slightly more concentrated. With that update, I found my sleds that I had designed to be purely tactical tower capping vehicles, became fantastic flank and fuck them in the ass vehicles.

I actually prefer sleds than hovers still, just because the height change of hovers is still broken, so I cant get myself behind rocks and hills as fast as I need. My 4 block height sleds however are really hard to hit and are still a little bit faster than hovers.

Plus, my sleds can fly at a moments notice If I want them to, ive built them very much like a thruster stick in that way. So if I need to get up there and take out a particularly pesky bomber, I can. Enemy team composition and position dependent of course.

Double layers of wings/rudders. I have them stacked one on top the other, always in pairs, but the mounting blocks are not connected to each other. I try to have at least a 10 block path between the 2 layers to protect from rail hits.

Helium. Depending on the weight and shape of the aircraft, I use 1 or 3 blocks of helium, not connected directly to each other, again, to protect against them all being taken out in one hit. I usually have 1 close to the centre of mass, and one a few blocks forward to help it turn without having to pull up.

Thrusters. I try to have one pair of thrusters that help with roll, and also allow me to turn on the ground. This allows me to easily get into position to take out connection blocks on towers if noone else is capping.

Then I always have up/down thrusters in the front. Thes help with fast pitch control as well as allowing full control if the entire back half is blown off.

The drop in CPU cost of helium was a big buff to aircraft IMO, its well worth making use of it.

I added some damage shots to these albums. In all of these, I still had full control, and will often remain combat capable with this amount of damage and still be able to get back for repairs if needed.

1356,"I use 2 different methods, both involve the use of prisms for your seat connection that are not connected to each other.

First is to build the bot in 2 completely seperate parts, both parts being fully functional bots on thier own. I use this for smaller bots mostly that cant tank shots by HP alone.

The other method sues a central core of blocks that zigzag thier way towards the outside, to maximise the amount of HP it takes to get tho the seat mainly. Then most of the central section of the bot surrounds the seat withoiut being connected to it. Finally, some sort of damage routing, using the shell of the bot itself to move damage around the bot as desired, or using aero rods to link 2 bulky sections together. With the aero rods, the damage kind of leaps to a different section of the bot before it can do critical damage to a single area.


This is a pretty simple example of a bot built in 2 seperate parts, both functioning well on thier own. http://imgur.com/a/2h4FT

Here is a simple example of using the aero rods to move damage around the bot. It has some routing damage bottom to top, and from back to the front. Its not the best example, but its easy to see as its on the outside of the bot. 2 or 3 direct hit rail shots to the back can be diverted to the bulky front section before the wings and pilot are in much danger. http://imgur.com/a/5Lmeb",2015-07-10 13:34:38+00:00,csyjmb5,1.0,t3_3cpzpk,59227,Robocraft

Though process of elimination, I found it to be a faulty ESC. One ESC was just not sending enough power to the motor, as soon as I replaced it I had a perfectly flying quad.

My guess is that removing the ground wire has revealed a problem that might have always been there but through some weird shit, it was working fine before.

If you only fly places where it doesnt matter if you have a failure in flight, id reconnect the ground wires and if it fixes the problem, fly the shit out of it.

If you fly anywhere near other people or proberty, then find the faulty part and replace it. If it is a bad ESC, then you have a hi chance of it failing on you in flight.

What I would do first though, is to triple check your centre of balance is correct with the new setup.

The entire game balance was designed around the robot ranking system. That system just needed balance tweaks. Play with the numbers until you get it right.

The new system makes robot ranking completely invalid. Completely, absolutely, 100% invalid. 

Making a bot now is just keeping it between the two limiting factors. Ranking doesnt ever come into play anymore. Hell, even if your robot ranking shows as being in a certain tier, its entirely possible, and even very likely, that you cant even take the bot into battle at its indicated tier because of the armor cap.

The entire reason the game was fun was because of the robot ranking system and your freedom to do whatever you wanted within that system. Not only was it relatively well balanced, its was pretty much the entire premise of the game.

What we have now is IMO not even the same game, and im not sure its even a game I want to play now. Maybe ill try disassembling a bot or two and try it out, but I will be leaving my main bots untouched with the hope of this update being rolled back.

On top of all this, I have been completely robbed of my sense of progression. I was enjoying, and looking forward to my next level, being able to add more to my bot, or change it completely, or try something different that I couldnt before. I was looking forward to the satisfaction of  getting my main bot into the next tier and working to make it a capable fighter at that level.

Now ive been thrown at level 100 and my bots have all skipped 2 tiers completely, if they are even useable that is, most arent.
As someone pointed out in another post, many people have even missed out on the satisfaction of having that lvl100 screenshot.

The entire balance of the game was based on this principle, changing this is changing the entire game.

I remember that feeling of finally having enough CPU to build that fun and interresting bot I had planned. Finally adding the last parts and starting a match with a huge goddamn smile on my face. This is never going to happen again for me with these restrictions, and many new comers will likely never get to experience it. At least, it will be a pain for them if they want to try something different. They will end up with something in a much higher tier than it should be in, and they will not enjoy their sweet ride, since they will be getting stomped on.

Your last point about not being able to play to your individual tase is the clincher for me. I like to play fast bots that I can zip around the map and flank the enemy, or harass with tower damage to force them to split thier forces, or whatever else I think of at the time. Every single one of my builds for this purpose are now 2 tiers above what they were, and they were relatively fragile already. 

If theres one thing I dont enjoy in this game, its rolling in with a gunbed on tracks and trading blows. Unfortunately, thats all I see being viable as it stands.

Its just so damn dis heartening to see the builds you spent hours building and testing, become nothing more than a pile of bricks that have greater value by trading them in for RP.

1395,"I had this issue during my first match, post patch. It stayed like it after the match too, making it almost impossible to do anything in the garage. I entered a second match to mess around with a different bot and it went back to normal. It stayed normal since then. ",2015-06-24 16:50:00+00:00,csh7xbp,1.0,t3_3ay9yw,10648,Robocraft
1396,"Honestly, I dont really know what to call it. Ill admit, ive been calling any issue to do with that part type the same thing.

Yes, its behaving closer to what happens with the heal bug. It feels like parts might be missing, I remember having control problems kind of similar when I was testing without vertical rudders on.

Since you mentioned it, I jumped on my T4 drone. I did find it affected by what I would call rubber banding. It wont let me turn if I am going fast, after I get part way through a tight turn, it will snap the nose back around to point in my original direction of travel. It seams this might be what you see as the rudder bug.

This problem also seems to be semi permanent, but it actually seems to come and go during the course of the match, without respawning or taking damage. It may just seem like it comes and goes, but might only be noticed in certain high speed turns.",2015-06-24 16:45:48+00:00,csh7r99,3.0,t1_csh4hwj,4890,Robocraft
1397,"I sure hope they are dynamic. Even if its just as simple as there being several options for placement of the mid tower. With only 3 static towers, large portions of most maps will almost never be used.",2015-06-24 12:19:32+00:00,csgysqz,1.0,t3_3axzrf,629,Robocraft
1398,"Restarting Steam client might get you past the initial login to the game. Still going to be rubbish accessing your garage or finding a match. Even after just going into practice to test out a bot, it just keeps cycling through all the lists and telling me it cant access them, without letting me use the garage that is already loaded.",2015-06-24 09:45:06+00:00,csgwd8a,1.0,t3_3ax9f4,12793,Robocraft
1399,"Nice work. Thanks for postong your results. A real shame that this doesn't work, it was aleaya a good safety backup for me of i got scanned.

On the bright side, this frees up a slot in my loadout, or saves weight sincw theres npthing else i really need.",2015-06-19 06:24:01+00:00,csbmbbz,10.0,t1_cs9uzo2,127249,EliteDangerous

Yep, I spent hours in the tutorials.",2015-06-19 05:14:20+00:00,csbkuyr,1.0,t3_3ad79z,4687,EliteDangerous
1401,"Id be interrested to know of its working too. Im pretty dedicated to using small ships atm though, so i almost never get scanned now anyway. Its possible i might never nees to try it unless i have a change of heart and get back into a bigger ship.

Right now im finding the easiest thing to do is just pop a heat sink on aproach. I time it so i am  at zero heat at about the time i usually get scanned. I still hover my fingers over the silent running and chaff controls ready to hit them both if i get scanned, but i havnt needed them yet.

Im like you. It seems silly to attract attention to yourself by coming in fast. For the sake of role play/immersion, i like to coast on nice and easy.",2015-06-17 17:14:55+00:00,cs9qqad,8.0,t1_cs9jxch,11054,EliteDangerous
1402,"I look forward to eventually having a courier too. I personally dont like the look of it as much as the DB, but Ive wanted a super eagle since my first day playing the game.

I designed a HUD to suit the Clipper a while ago that might be worth trying out. I dont know if the colours are the same in the Courier, but if they are then it should be a good match.

1403,Well. What can i say. Your obviously just going to lose your mind at anyone trying to help you. Have fun not enjoying the game because you are unable to take responsibility for your own actions.,2015-06-17 13:56:33+00:00,cs9jhdn,5.0,t1_cs9j0ef,946,EliteDangerous
1404,"Hmmm. Chaff has absolutely delayed scans for me prior to 1.3. I actually havnt needed to use it since the update so i dont know if it wrks now, i just assumed it would.

Im not just making this up either so dont start telling me im mistaken. I comsistently coasted through the mail slot without fear, up to 20 seconds after a scan on me starting. Never once got fined after i started using it. 

As a scavanger/smuggler, i consider it a pretty major part of my game. If this hasnt been working for some ppl then that really blows :(",2015-06-17 13:52:17+00:00,cs9jcj8,6.0,t1_cs9iwjk,904,EliteDangerous
1405,"And i bet you were yelling shit shit shit, or something the whole time, and sighed massively when you got away. Possibly followed by a giggle of joy.
Surprises make gaming great. I did the same thing when i started the game, made it back with cracked canopy and everything. Damn it was awesome.",2015-06-17 13:39:58+00:00,cs9izi4,2.0,t1_cs9fudc,7848,EliteDangerous
1406,"Just a little common sense stops most people from making that mistake, assuming they dont want to make the mistake that is. When most missions on offer are giving you 20k or less as reward, and even the more dangerous smuggling might be offering 40k, what goes through someones mind to think taking that 80k mission is a good idea.

These offers are deliberately part of the game specifically to trick the greedy and over ambitious into taking it and making a big mistake. This type of thing has been a staple component of games for decades for a reason, for most people this sort of thing is fun. It adds the possibility of your story taking a turn from what you had planned. Its only a very few people who do not enjoy when this happens in a game. Im sorry you are one of them, i truly am, you are missing out on something great. Biting off more than i could chew, and ending up on some crazy errand or story path has made some of the greatest moments in my gaming life.",2015-06-17 13:36:07+00:00,cs9ivc0,3.0,t1_cs9hl1x,2809,EliteDangerous
1407,"Silent running means they have to be very close to scan you.

Dropping your heat output by turning off systems and dropping a heat sink means they have to be VERY close to scan you.

Using Chaff after they start scanning you will delay the scan, providing you make sure to keep the chaff between you and them. This usually gives you plenty of time to dock.

Pretty sure that once you are through the mail slot the scan stops and you cant be scaned once inside at all.",2015-06-17 12:50:18+00:00,cs9hlyf,2.0,t1_cs9h65k,1076,EliteDangerous
1408,"You need to start with lower lvl missions if you ore only flying an eagle. Dont take missions for such a high reward.

You should be able to handle anything up to about 40k reward. They are more likely to be something like a Cobra as your target.

1.3 introduced lots of lower lvl stuff for beginner cmdrs that didnt exist previously. Be thankful you have the option to do them now. Previously, it was Elite Anacondas or nothing.

Getting a bounty on you in an Anarchy system sucks balls though. I would submit a ticket for that, it doesnt sound right at all.",2015-06-17 12:45:41+00:00,cs9hhuv,1.0,t3_3a5g03,5663,EliteDangerous
