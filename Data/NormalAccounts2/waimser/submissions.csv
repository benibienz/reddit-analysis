I dont know whats doing it, maybe others loading into the instance or someone else starting the minigame maybe. The mouse curser just freezes up for a bit while the particles just pass on by.

This sort of freezing doesnt happen any where else in the game for me, not even in the slideshow Delta Quadrant systems, controls still remain fairly smooth even when the frame rate drops.

It def not a a framerate issue anyway, it happens even when im running 120fps or more.

Im not getting any cpu, gpu, or memory use spike, and the timing of it is completely random.

Is not just lag, when it lags the minigame just skips a bunch of particles, this is just the mouse curser freezing up so it cant fget to where it needs to be.

Just wondering if anyone else is getting it, and maybe theres the off chance someone knows a fix.

Edit. Ive been doing some testing, cause I got nothing better to do today. I cant find anything that would cause something like this. No background tasks are using anything, there are no spikes in GPU, CPU, or memory load.

What I am getting, is a fairly sizable drop in FPS towards the end of the minigame.

before opening minigame. 100fps

minigame open and started 96fps

end of minigame 84-88 fps

The drop in frames is pretty consistent. It happens smoothly as the game speeds up, theres no sudden change. The Cursor freeze does happen occasionally in the early stages, but it gets quite bad about 2/3 through, sometimes it just happens once or twice, sometimes it starts and keeps happening till the game ends.

Its deffinately worse today than it was yesterday before the maintinence. Yesterday I got a score of 2400 multiple times. Today its almost impossible to crack 2000 since the last 1/3 of the minigame I barely have any control.

EDIT 2.

Graphics settings seem to make a huge difference in the playability of the game. Even though dropping the settings makes no difference whatsoever to my frame rate indoors, the lower settings have helped immensely.

I dropped resolution scale to the lowest setting first and it helped quite alot.

I dropped the game resolution down to 1280x720 next and have played 5 games so far without a single instance of the cursor freezing. No difference in my frame rate, but the minigame is nice and smooth.

Unless something else has happened at the exact time as I dropped the settings, then it is pretty clear that the lower settings help.

There is now zero reason for someone to fly a traditional style bomber with exposed wings instead of a fully enclosed drone.

Drones are almost completely unaffected by this patch, actually they have been buffed significantly. Previously you could at least sneak up on them with a high flying bomber, now.. well you get the point.

The flack cannons. Drones fly erratically and very fast, they naturally dodge the flack just by flying the way a good pilot normally would. Even if they do take hits, thier important componants are still protected by the shell, which is still just as tough as ever.

Normal slow predictable bomers, which have wings exposed to show you the direction they are pointing, are easy pickings for the flack however. Add to this the fact that the flack seems to take off the wings from an entire side in one hit, and you leave absolutely no reason to fly with exposed wings.

Now, this possably wouldnt have been so bad with the fog still in the game.But with the fog gone, you can see those nice juicy targets..i mean, bombers, coming from accross the map. Given approximately 30 seconds of practice, you can take the wings off a bomber the instant they leave thier shield and forfet about them for the next 15 seconds or so.

Drones are again, almost completely unaffected by this, they just fly as normal and dodge the flack constantly because their movement is still just as unpredictable as ever.

Now I could handle these changes, might even welcome them, if all this meant that it was once again viable to use my first love in the game, fast moving hovers. But since it still takes about a minute to get within shouting distance of the ground after i crest a slight rise in terrain, that leaves me completely at the mercy of the new flack cannons, since I am now classed as airborne, AND have no control over my bot untlil the game decides Ive had enough time in pergatory.

Best of all, is that theres now literally one way to play the game. Head to head fighting. 2 teams come together and bump heads and the team tht blinks, loses. Yes, even in arena. Any attempt to flank, or to take a tower behind enemy lines is instantly spotted from accross the map.

So what are we left with?

The team who has the most powerful(usually painfully boring or ugly) bots copied from the CRF, wins. Every match.

It doesnt take long to find that the items are not just unequipped, they have been completely removed from my inventory.

This is where i find out that cryptic support is utterly terrible. 1 response per day seems to be their limit. Ive had items go missing in games before and the matter has ALWAYS been resolved within hours, if not minutes. Not cryptic, they cant respond to you more than once a day.

So, after 3 days i finally get them to actually check for the missing items, finally convincing them that i do in fact understand how to equip an item on a ship, and that the items are missing, not just unequipped.

The they get back to me the next day with this.

""We apologize for the inconvenience, but after concluding our investigation, we were unable to verify the loss of any items. Due to this we will unfortunately not be able to restore your items. Thank you for your understanding.""

Is it luck based if I get the Advanced version? Or do you only get that the first time. Basically wondering if its worth me trying again to get it or if I need to look into upgrading the one I have.

If I go down the route of upgrading the Advanced version, is there particular stuff I need to do to get the most out of it? Or does it automatically become the best version at its highest upgrade level? This question goes for other reward gear I have too.

Tanks for any details you can give me, its really hard to find anything up to date on this particular piece, since both the upgrade system, and the shield itself seem to have been changed multiple times since any info I have found was written.

Also on that note, is this piece still part of a set like it says in game? Seems to be contradicting info, some says it wasnt a set but now is, some says it was a set, now isnt. Really confusing for someone just starting out when the wiki cant be trusted .

I have always used Shift as a swim down/lower altitude button in mmo style games. I want to do the same in STO, have Shift be the control to pitch forward.

Setting the keybind itself was easy enough but actually using it is problematic.

Example. If I already have another key held down, ie, im turning, the shift control wont do anything. Likewise, if I am holding shift to pitch forward, I cannot do anything else at the same time since the game is waiting for a two part control to be completed instead of just activating the second control.

One thing I have tried to do is set Shift+A and Shift+D as pitch down, but with only 2 bind spacesI cannot use it in a straight line. Plus I can then only perform both actions at the same time if the two keys are pressed in the right order, which defeats the purpose of it anyway.

I would just set Shift to a different key using regedit, I have already done this with capslock to avoid allcapsing in chat in all my games so it would be easy enough to do. However, STO somehow is able to see past this and still sees capslock as capslock even though the rest of my PC sees it as something else. So again, this wouldnt work.

Has anyone managed to find a way to disable Shift as a modifier in this game so it can be used as a normal control?

Thanks for any help you can give me guys. This niggling little thing is the only thing stopping me from having my usual control setup as I like it.

BTW, i only just started last night and im having alot of fun with the game. It really seems to be a good game for being in Australia too, since (in PvE at least) the lag I get has almost no effect on my game play like it does with other MMOs.

I find it really difficult to actually get any understanding of the story from just reading the wiki, and ive found WPs insights and explanations invaluable in getting a feel for the story so far since I cant experience it myself. Also alot of the video is really helpful to actually see some of what was happening. 

Is anyone able to put some of his vids in order for me maybe? 

Is there another source as good as WP for this stuff?

And to help me direct my search a bit. Does the story divert away from scarlet onto other things for a while or should I keep looking for content with her included?

Thanks guys. I know the content itself shouldnt be hard to find, Im just trying to avoid seeing anything out of order if I can.

I dont really intend this to be a rant, though it sure looks like one. More, letting FJ know there are reasons why they are not retaining player numbers. The game has great potential, but if they never get around to fixing the shit that has been broken since before I started playing, then the game will continue to die the fast death it has been. 

Its a sad day for me, it really is. As someone who grew up with Lego and Meccano, RC has been perfect for letting the child in me build and have fun with all manner of crazy creations. But its time to free up the space on my SSD for games that arent completely broken.

Half the time just from turning a corner, it starts to flip and usually doesnt stop flipping untill I can manage to lower it to the ground.

Also after any time I travel down hill at all, my bot will then lower itself to the ground after a few seconds.

Also, if anyone has the time, could you pls link this post to the tech / bugs section on the forums. They are messed up again and I cant post there.

Or traits, or whatever it was?

I have several characters from before you had to unlock them, but I want to start a new one to learn the game again and play through the story. 

The only thing that would stop me from making a new character for this is if I have to complete all the maps to get the skills or traits I want. 

While im at it, Does anyone happen to know the easiest/earliest place I can tame a ranged pet for a ranger? Ill be starting as a Norn if that makes a difference ( steriotypical I know, but I like the lore).

I want a ranged pet for RP, I dont like the pet to do the tanking, Id rather my character tanks and the pet does damage and stay safe.

Even trying to stay low in canyons most of the time doesnt help anymore, the moment you pass a gap in the mountains, you get destroyed instantly. Heaven forbid you should try and get some altitude to try and take out a bomber, this gets you taken down by perfectly accurate smg fire from accross the map.

The game is pretty much a dice roll right now. The team with the most cheaters wins.

Thanks FJ, its been fun, I love the game, but its time to find something else im sorry.

Someone PM me if it improves in the next few weeks.",Robocraft,Feels like its only railers and no spread cheaters left playing the game.,http://www.reddit.com/r/Robocraft/comments/3d3twp/feels_like_its_only_railers_and_no_spread/

In case the T4 and 5 meta turns to bombers again with the release of the eagle bomber in the shop, Ive revived my old T4 interceptor.

She's super agile for dodging plasma and rail shots, can take a fir bit of damage and still fight/make it home, and she eats other flyers for breakfast. Enjoy.

The design works pretty well up till T7 with armor and components upgraded. After that the incoming damage from SMG fire is too much to last in a fight.The last 2 pics in the album show the changes needed to fit T5 and 6 thrusters. Then just lengthen the nose as needed to fit bigger weapons on the front. Guns can be placed on the top and bottom of the nose too if roborank allows for it.

If you are limited by CPU, leave off some of the maneuvering thrusters from the front first. If you are left with only 1 pair each for up and down, then remove the reverse thrusters and the forward thruster above the cockpit. If you still need CPU, then build something else :)",Robocraft,T4 Interceptor,http://www.reddit.com/r/Robocraft/comments/3bs7k9/t4_interceptor/

Sorry, I dont know why the title URL linked to itself instead of the album.


By using Cluly's method of poking the aero rods between the plates, and plugging the end gaps with thrusters(at least, thats where I first saw it), I was finally able to finish off my Interceptor that Id been working on since T6.

In fact, these methods are so space efficient, I was able to include T10.1 plates inside to guarantee she breaks off small pieces from rail fire.

One of the pics is a close up of the interior showing the aero rods Ive used to zigzag through the inside to keep essential systems separate from each other. Its hard to get a screenshot of how it works even with all systems removed, so I didnt bother. Its a work in progress anyway, Im only just starting to understand how damage travels through bots, so there is room for improvement.

The chassis is a big loop, it has a couple weak points, but most damage taken from the outside must travel through at least 2 of the T10.1 plates to get to the seat. Im working on how to protect more of the systems as well with this method.  At the moment, if I can retain 1/4 of the thrusters its pretty easy to control still. It can fight somewhat effectively with either the entire top or bottom half missing.
