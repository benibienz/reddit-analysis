At this stage, vegans are expected to be perfect and if you are a vegan, you should know that. Any false information hurts veganism because you see the stupids of Youtube and other amplifying mediums blow them out of proportion to suppress the movement and give carnists yet another few weeks to justify their meat eating habits.

So, excuse me for being slightly concerned about the claims about his vegan diet. It is still not a 100% clear that Nate is a vegan or pescetarian. There are youtube videos and articles that say he's a pescetarian.

Here's a good description of how autosuggest works: http://searchengineland.com/how-google-instant-autocomplete-suggestions-work-62592

You can check the keyword volume for the keywords separated by comma in Google adwords (Search volume) and Google Trends (to check it's freshness/demand) and 'meat is murder' beats the other shitty keywords hands down in both these tools' dara. Couldn't be bothered uploading screenshots so if someone can do that to add to this post, that would be great. 

My guess is that it got removed for one of these reasons (from the article I've mentioned above):


#Why &amp;amp; How Suggestions Get Removed

&gt;Google’s predictions have been offered for years, but when they were coupled with Google Instant, that sparked a renewed interest in what was suggested and what wasn’t. Were things being removed?
&gt;Yes, and for these specific reasons, Google says:

* Hate or violence related suggestions
* Personally identifiable information in suggestions
* Porn &amp;amp; adult-content related suggestions
* Legally mandated removals
* Piracy-related suggestions

&gt;Automated filters may be used to block any suggestion that’s against Google’s policies and guidelines from appearing, the company says. For example, the filters work to keep things that seem like phone numbers and social security numbers from showing up.
&gt;Since the filters aren’t perfect, some suggestions may get kicked over for a human review, Google says.

I have to disagree, especially when it comes to the food products. If a matter concerns public safety, I think people have every right to know what's in their food. Companies are already required to list the ingredients. A subtle mark to indicate whether a product consists meat or not can't hurt much. Can it? If anything, it'll only improve the UX as people won't have to go through the long list of ingredients before making a purchase.

Didn't realise veganism or xyz had to contribute something 'special' in order to qualify for such labeling but I would've thought vegan food's minimal carbon footprint and animal cruelty free attributes are special enough.",2016-02-29 07:41:02+00:00,d0hubxr,6.0,t1_d0hteiy,2821.0,vegan

Nice of you to be thoughtful of your wife but there's no way Reddit would tolerate calling Carnism a cult, outside of this subreddit. 

You say:

&gt; All about opening my mind and accepting the truth. It sounds like a cult or conspiracy theory guys.

What exactly sounds like a cult or a conspiracy theory? Most of the things discussed here are backed by reliable resources and if something isn't, it gets a harsh critique from other vegans. I remember a few days ago when Bite size Vegan got some criticism for ignoring facts.

Your implication that this subreddit is a circle-jerk section without actually exploring the threads or citing any specific examples doesn't make much sense, just shows the level of your self proclaimed rationality.

Rest of the Reddit is pretty much of an echo chamber for carcinogenic bacon loving irrational carnists. It ignores any scientific evidence against meat consumption, makes flippant comments regarding non-pet animals about to die.

P.S: Good luck with the transition and just a headsup - brace yourself for the ad-hominem ""just kidding"" attacks from your omni buds. If you don't want to face it, just don't tell anyone. You'll soon find out that the good old omni saying - 'how do you know someone is vegan....' is a myth. People like myself avoid mentioning this term because of instant hostility it generates in individuals you barely know. My personal favorite is the use of 'plant based diet'.
