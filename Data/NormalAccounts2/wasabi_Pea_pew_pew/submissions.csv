I will be seeing her after about a month and her only complaint to me is that I am not romantic enough and my emotional side is not developed enough to meet her emotional needs.

I try but I am also aware that I am a bit apathetic when it comes to the area of romance. Also, most of the times, my mind is occupied with work so I am easily distracted (since emotions and romance are not important to me). I have planned a romantic holiday in a b&amp;b when I get home after my research. What can I do to make it special?

Also, what's a perfect romantic gift in your opinion or anything that you've got and really stuck with you. My budget is about $200 - $500. I know she needs a new phone as the old phone crapped itself, should I buy a new phone?

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks for the helpful responses so far guys. For the gift, I couldn't think of anything so I've decided jewellery for now.

Recently there was a post regarding x amount of people won't touch a food packet because they saw the 'vegan' label on it. They instead chose a same food labelled as 'classic'.

As we all know, veganism is not very acceptable at the moment. What message do you guys think will be better recieved by the omnis (as in: won't trigger their defences)?

I have been spreading the message ""eat less meat, save lives"" and ""try going vegetarian"" because I know a lot of bacon wielding folks who instantly get ultra defensive or start behaving in an irrational manner when I mention veganism.

Has anyone had much luck with a more passive message that sprouts an idea in the omnis' minds without triggering their defences (and making me sound like a holier than thou whatever)?

Also, it should be available in pdf format so that I can easily read it on my handheld device as I don't like carrying books around with me. If you are a nutritionist, please mention that in your comment.

Hopefully it doesn't count as seeking legal advice and breach of this subreddit's terms.

So I was having a lot of payments related problems with a client of mine and I always had to chase up 2 - 3 months old invoices. I decided to terminate my services as they had not paid me for 3 months. Everytime I would remind there would be a response like:

'Oh we are really sorry, I will get our accountant (client's wife) to do make the payment tomorrow'
a week later 'Oh, I will personally make the payment on Monday'
a month later ""hasn't this invoice been paid yet? ""
I explain and after about after about one week the cycle goes on.

There wasn't a single instance when they made a payment without any fuss.
So I decided to stop working with them and issued a letter of demand as the payments were behind by about 3 months. The client made up the same BS, made me go through the same cycle. Told me how stressed he has been over this. Stalled for time and it's been about a month and a half and there I haven't heard anything from them.

My reminders have been completely ignored.
The money owed ($1500) is not enough for a debt collection service to be interested in it. What alternatives do I have? Something that will leave me with at least  $1350.
