7,"What you're doing is attributing change to Allah, as if the existence of the Universe affects him i.e. that he exists RELATIVE to the Universe, which is nonsense. You're saying that he had no location, but upon the creation of the universe/the creation, he acquired a location. If he had no location before, how can you say that now he does have a location? Was his location dependent on creation being present or not? Is he dependent on that? If he removes creation again, will he be without location again? Because if you follow this Aqeedah of yours and you follow this reason, then it can be argued that Allah can further move from ABOVE the 'arsh INTO the creation. Just like he is outside of it, what prevents him from moving in? And he can move into humans, as he was outside of them. I mean seriously, this is blatant kufr. The Christians can use this belief and say God created the universe, then he *moved* into it, and then he moved into a human, and so Jesus became/was God. This is such kufr, honestly. How can you attribute a location and space to God? 

The Ulema and the Salaf are clear, we accept the verses and we don't start interpreting them according to our desires and bringing random interpretations. We accept them according to the intended meaning of Allah and his Messenger SAW. Allah 'azza wa jal is now as He was before, and He is not dependent on anything! Space and time and everything besides Him, is a creation. He created, and He is far exalted above having any form or shape as his creation has.

Nafl simply means voluntary. If you went right now to pray two raka'āt, that would be a voluntary prayer you did. What is obligatory to pray is the farḍ prayers.

It is obligatory to do, and it is classified as a finisher to the night. Even other madhāhib, while not considering it obligatory per se consider it highly praiseworthy to do.

56,"I don't post here often but I'll just tell you the Islamic perspective.

In Islam, we do not talk about ''You'll go to hell'' or ''You'll go to heaven'' - but rather we talk about the traits of the people of heaven and the traits of the people of hell. This is because nobody knows where they will end up, but we do know the characteristics we're supposed to abandon and the ones we're supposed to adopt.

That said, if you believe God and his eternality, then I am sure you agree with Him existing pre-eternally and eternally, without anything co-existing with him. That would mean God is knowledge and God is power at his very essence. They are main attributes he carries. 

If that is true, then whatever he dictates to be moral, than that is moral. This is because he is 1. All wise and 2. All powerful. To claim your own beliefs of morality are greater than God's is to deny him his core attributes, which would mean he isn't God.

I recommend you watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJqxs_tzhfE

In Islam, whatever you work towards, that you will attain. There is no limits and everything is up to you. 

&gt; I died I went to hell because I think the life I've lived deserves that

Please do reconsider your views. Hell is eternal torture.

Would you want your mother run over with a truck? Would you want your skin burnt off? Does any of this sound like something you want? If not, then how can you ever say you'd be okay with Hell. Hell is not some place of just sitting down and doing nothing. It is the worst possible pain you can imagine, multiplied by more than you can imagine. It is not a place anyone would want to be.

It would diversify your knowledge of the madhāhib and it would also boost your entry qualifications for the Dar ul Ulūm because you'd already be a ḥāfidh. This way you'd have no commitment to any place while you try to find your place of what you exactly want to study when it comes to our religion. :)

One final benefit of studying in Morocco and Mauritania etc is that there's no specific curriculum, and after Memorizing the Book of Allāh 'azza wa jal, you can pretty much choose what book you want to study with the Shaykh, or you'll go to the village next over if he isn't qualified to teach that book, whereas in a Madrassah you get taught a specific curriculum.",2016-11-06 19:47:39+00:00,d9oinuj,2.0,t1_d9oi6n9,625.0,islam
70,"Arabic you can learn along the way.

I would check out some of the Dar ul Ulūms in India and also in South Africa. These mainly teach Ḥanafī Fiqh and Shafi'i Fiqh, and the curriculum is about 6 years (2 extra years for a Masters in i.e. Ḥadīth or Tafsīr or Aqīdah). You can also find some in England but these are more expensive and not always an option. Additionally there are also madāris in Malaysia, even (Sunnī) ones in Iran, so don't restrict your option.

If you want to check the curriculum of a general Dar ul Ulūm, check for example the one out in [Deoband](/http://www.darululoom-deoband.com/english/sys_of_edu/index.htm).

The advantage of studying in places like South Africa is that it costs about £1k per year and the rest is provided for. India and other places are cheaper and you have many more scholars to access to, but the climate is incredible hot, and you might not be used to the language (although you'd pick it up in no time).

If you want to study Mālikī Fiqh, then I suggest looking into Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and all these places. The issue with these places is that studying is pretty much free, but you live in the desert so you have a very hot and difficult environment to work with. What is also difficult about this is that most Madāris in Morocco and Mauritania and the Maghrib in general won't allow you to study anything without being a ḥāfidh of the Qur'ān first. Their curriculum can last for more than 17 years because they heavily emphasise memorising almost everything you study, but as opposed to a Dar ul Ulūm there is not necessarily any commitment (I.e. If you don't like it you simply stop studying after 3 years or 2 months). Also their Arabic tends to be very good due to the emphasis of study of grammar constantly, and memorization of rules.

These are cheap and good alternatives to Madīnah and Azhar that will bring you to the same level of knowledge. Don't assume that just because it's international well known university that it is better.

77,"These are not only for Ikrimah, they are for almost every person. In Ilm ul Rijāl it is assumed that everyone is a liar unless he is proven truthful. There is no 'benefit of the doubt' when it comes to the Prophetic tradition. Alī ibn abi ṭālib used to make other companions swear that they heard x and y from the Prophet SAW before he would accept their words, despite the fact they're a companion and obviously trustworthy. Does that mean he's calling them liars? Of course not. But there is no ""innocent until proven guilty"" in this field. 

Many times for example Imām Ahmad would be asked about such and such a person, and he would say there is no problem with their reports, or he would say they are weak in memory, or he would say they are the best of the best. These are not because the person was attacked on their memory or reliability, but because people would want to make sure the claims made are trustworthy.

&gt; Ibn Abī Khaythama (d. 279) narrates with an authentic chain that Ayyūb al-Sakhtiyānī (68 – 131 H) was asked about ‘Ikrimah and he said: 
&gt;لو لم يكن عندي ثقة لم أكتب عنه

&gt;‘Had he not been trustworthy according to me, I would not have written from him.’ (Tārīkh Ibn Abī Khaythamah, 2382; Tahdhīb al-Kamāl, 20:275)


&gt;Ayyūb al-Sakhtiyānī was one of the great imāms of the salaf from the Tābi‘īn, someone who interacted with ‘Ikrimah directly, and studied under him.

The scholar of Hadith Ḥāfiẓ Ibn Ḥajr al-‘Asqalānī in his introduction to Fatḥ al-Bārī defends Ikrimah. He says: Those who weakened ‘Ikrimah did so on account of one of three reasons: being untruthful, being from the Khārijī sect and accepting money from the government. (Hady al-Sārī, Dār Ṭaybah, p. 1136-1145) Ibn Ḥajr shows that the first allegation is not accurate, the second allegation is not proven, while the third is true but does not detract from a person’s reliability. Other accepted ḥadīth masters, like Ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī, would also take money from the government. (Hady al-Sārī, p. 1141) 

Ibn Ḥajr shows that some of the critical statements are inauthentic, while some are interpreted in a positive way. For instance, your claim that ‘Alī, the son of Ibn ‘Abbās, accused ‘Ikrimah of being untruthful is reported through an unreliable narrator, Yazīd ibn Abī Ziyād (as pointed out by Ibn Ḥibbān), and is therefore rejected. (Hady al-Sārī, p. 1140)

&gt; Imām Al-Bukhārī narrates: Sufyān ibn ‘Uyaynah reported from ‘Amr ibn Dīnār from Abu l-Sha‘tā’ Jābir ibn Zayd (d. 93), all three of them accepted imāms of the salaf, that the latter handed a parchment to ‘Amr ibn Dīnār containing some questions, saying: ‘Go ask ‘Ikrimah.’ ‘Amr ibn Dīnār appeared somewhat hesitant, so Jābir ibn Zayd snatched the parchment from his hand and said: 
&gt;هذا عكرمة مولى ابن عباس، هذا أعلم الناس 


&gt; ‘This is ‘Ikrimah, the freed-slave of Ibn ‘Abbās. This is the most knowledgeable of people.’ (al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr, 7:49)

&gt; The same is narrated by Ibn Sa‘d from Ismā‘īl ibn ‘Ulayyah, his teacher, from Ayyūb al-Sakhtiyānī (68 – 131 H) from ‘Amr ibn Dīnār, but with the words: ‘This is ‘Ikrimah, the freed-slave of Ibn ‘Abbās. This is an ocean, so ask him.’ (Ṭabaqāt Ibn Sa‘d, Maktabah al-Khānjī, 7:284) These are authentic chains. 

And there are many, many more defences of Ikrimah. And I do ask you to be careful of what you accuse him of.

&gt; Al-Mizzī reports in Tahdhīb al-Kamāl that ‘Āmir al-Sha‘bī (d. 104), the great Kūfan imām from the Tābi‘īn, said: ما بقي أحد أعلم بكتاب الله من عكرمة 

&gt; ‘No one remains who is more knowledgeable of the Book of Allāh than ‘Ikrimah.’ (Tahdhīb al-Kamāl, 20:272

And also...

&gt; Aḥmad ibn ‘Abdillāh al-‘Ijlī (d. 261) said:عكرمة مولى ابن عباس: ثقة، وهو بريئ مما يرميه الناس من الحرورية، وهو تابعي

‘‘Ikrimah, the freed-slave of Ibn ‘Abbās: Trustworthy. He is innocent of what people accuse him of, of being from the Khārijites. He is a Tābi‘ī.’ (Tārīkh al-Thiqāt, Dār al-Kutub al-‘Ilmiyya, p. 339)

Ibn Ḥajr also said: ‘His being an innovator is not (historically) proven.’ (Taqrīb al-Tahdhīb)

78,"You're wrong, bro.


Ibn Ḥajr quotes the following narration: 

Muḥammad ibn Fuḍayl said, reporting from ‘Uthmān ibn Ḥakīm: I was sitting with Abū Umāmah ibn Sahl ibn Ḥanīf (d. 100), when ‘Ikrimah came. He said: ‘Abū Umāmah, I remind you by Allāh, did you hear Ibn ‘Abbās say:


ما حدثكم عني عكرمة فصدقوه، فإنه لم يكذب علي 

“Whatever ‘Ikrimah narrates to you from me, assent to him, for he does not lie about me.”’


Abū Umāmah said: ‘Yes.’

Ibn Ḥajr comments: ‘This is a ṣaḥīḥ chain.’ (Hady al-Sārī, p. 1142) [Primary sources for this narration are Tārīkh al-Dūrī and Ḍu‘afā’ of al-‘Uqaylī]

[Abū Umāmah ibn Sahl (d. 100) was either a young ṣaḥābī or a senior Tābi‘ī born in the lifetime of the Prophet (ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam). He was a great imām whose narrations are found in the six famous collections of ḥadīths.]

Ibn Sa‘d narrates with an authentic chain to Ḥabīb ibn Abī Thābit (d. 119), a reliable narrator from the students of several ṣaḥābah:

‘‘Ikrimah passed by ‘Aṭā’ (ibn Abī Rabāḥ) and Sa‘īd (ibn Jubayr), and narrated to them. When he got up (and left), I said to the two of them: “Do you disapprove of anything that he narrates?” They both said: “No.”’ (Ṭabaqāt Ibn Sa‘d, Maktabah al-Khānjī, 7:284)

This is an authentic testimony from two of the greatest of Ibn ‘Abbās’s students that ‘Ikrimah’s narrations are unproblematic.

Imam al-Dhahabi (d. 748 AH) on Tafwid al-Ma'na

He mentioned in his Siyar a'lam an-Nubala (8/105):

فقولنا في ذلك وبابه: الإقرار، والإمرار، وتفويض معناه إلى قائله الصادق المعصوم

""Our saying in this and what falls under it is: Submission to the text, passing it on as it came and consigning the knowledge of its meaning (tafwidh ma'nahu) to its Sacrosanct and Truthful Sayer.""

He also said in his Siyar a'lam an-Nubala (14/376):

وَأَمَّا السَّلَفُ، فَمَا خَاضُوا فِي التَّأْوِيْلِ، بَلْ آمَنُوا وَكَفُّوا، وَفَوَّضُوا عِلمَ ذَلِكَ إِلَى اللهِ وَرَسُوْلِه

""As for the Salaf (three earliest Muslim generations), then they did not delve into interpretation (of the Attributes), but rather they believed, refrained, and consigned the knowledge of that to Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam).""

Al-Dhahabi also said in his Mizan al I'tidal (2/420, Bijawi edn):

أما معنى حديث الصورة فنرد علمه إلى الله ورسوله ونسكت كما سكت السلف مع الجزم بأن الله ليس كمثله شئ.

""As for the meaning of the hadith which mentions image (sura), then we surrender its knowledge to Allah and His Messenger and we remain silent, just as the Salaf remained silent, along with firm conviction on the fact that there is nothing whatsoever like Allah.""

&gt; Abu Haneefah (RH) said, when asked of his opinion of the one who says, 'I do not know whether Allaah is above the heavens or on the earth.' - ""He has disbelieved, because Allaah says, ""The Most Merciful rose above the Throne."" , and His Throne is above His seven heavens.' He was then asked , 'what if he said that Allaah is above His Throne but he does not know whether the Throne is in the heavens or on the earth?' He said, 'He has disbelieved, because He has denied that He is above the heavens, And whosoever denied that He is above the heavens has disbelieved."" ['al-Uluww' of adh- Dhahabee, also 'Sharh Aqueedah at-Tahaawiyyah' of ibn Abee al-Izz al-Hanafee]""&gt;&gt;


In fact this statement attributed to Imam Abu Hanifah is mawdu` and a lie in its attribution to the Imam. Al-Dhahabi himself states [Mukhtasar p. 136 #118; al-`Uluw p. 391 #327] that everything above was reported from the Imam by Abu Muti` al-Hakam ibn `Abd Allah al-Balkhi who is DISCARDED as a narrator according to Imam Ahmad, Ibn `Adi, Abu Dawud, a liar according to Abu Hatim, and a forger according to al-Dhahabi himself as reported by Ibn Hajar in Lisan al-Mizan (2:407)!.

Even so, the text mentioned by the Hanafi authorities is: ""Whoever says, 'I do not know whether my Lord is in the heaven or on earth' is a disbeliever and, similarly, whoever says, 'He is on the Throne and I do not know whether the Throne is in the heaven or on earth ' is a disbeliever.""

As to its meaning: al-Bayadi said in Ishaaraat al-Maraam: ""This is because he implies that the Creator has a direction and a boundary, and anything that possesses direction and boundary is necessarily created. So this statement explicitly attributes imperfection to Allah Most High. The believer in [divine] corporeality and direction is someone who denies the existence of anything other than objects that can be pointed to with the senses. They deny the Essence of the Deity that is transcendent beyond that. This makes them positively guilty of disbelief."" As quoted in al-Kawthari, ""Khuturat al-Qawl bi al-Jiha"" (""The Gravity of the Doctrine That Attributes Direction [to Allah Most High]"") in his _Maqalat_ (p. 368-369).

Imam Abu Mansur al-Maturidi states something similar in Sharh al-Fiqh al-Akbar, and others.



Another report used by the Salafis to buttress their claims is the following:

&gt;  &lt;&lt;""Abdullah bin Nafi' reported: Malik bin Anas said: 'Allah is above the heavens, but His knowledge encompasses everything. Nothing escapes His knowledge.'"" [Abdullah bin Ahmad, as-Sunnah, and others. ]&gt;&gt; This report is not authentic from Imam Malik.

From Mutarrif ibn 'Abd Allâh - al-Bukhârî's shaykh - and Habib ibn Abî Habib on the hadîth of descent (""Our blessed Lord descends in the late third of the night""): ""It is our Blessed and Exalted Lord's command which descends &lt;every pre-dawn (kullu sahar)&gt;1; as for Him, He is eternally the same, He does not move or go to and fro.""2 Ibn Rushd in Sharh al-'Utbiyya - a commentary on an early work of Mâlikî jurisprudence by Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz al-'Utbî al-Qurtubî (d. 254) - stated that Mâlik's position is: ""The Throne is not Allâh's location of settledness (mawdi' istiqrâr Allâh).""3 The report attributing to Imâm Mâlik the words: ""Allâh is in the heaven and His knowledge is in every place"" is a condemned (munkar), anomalous (shâdhdh) report of questionable authenticity narrated through Ahmad ibn Hanbal from Surayj ibn al-Nu'mân al-Lu'lu'I4 from 'Abd Allâh ibn Nâfi' al-Sa'igh from Mâlik.5 Imâm Ahmad himself declared 'Abd Allâh ibn Nâfi' al-Sa'igh weak (da'îf), Abû Zur'a frowned at his name and declared him ""condemned"" (munkar), al-Bukhârî questioned his memorization, and Ibn 'Adi stated that he transmitted oddities (gharâ'ib) from Mâlik.6 As for the content of the report, Shaykh 'Abd al-Fattah Abû Ghudda noted in his commentary on Ibn 'Abd al-Barr's al-Intiqa' that it is contradicted by what is firmly established in mass-transmitted narrations from Mâlik and by al-Sa'igh's other report from Mâlik omitting the above words.7 The report is made further dubious by the fact that Mâlik was well-known to condemn any statements about the Essence and Attributes of Allâh Most High other than sound reports, particularly statements that suggest anthropomorphism.8 Al-Awzâ'î said: ""Whoever holds on to the rare and unusual positions of the scholars has left Islâm.""9

229,"Imām al Ghazālī رحمه الله was a practitioner of taṣawwuf, but he didn't permit music straight out just because it is good. Some instruments are still forbidden, his work is often misquoted by people who would like music to be ḥalāl. In these subjects, we first purify our intention, then we go in. Imām al Qurṭubī in his Tafsīr writes that it is impermissible to hold an opinion and then try to find evidence in the Qur'ān and Sunnah. Rather, you have to assume nothing, then see where the Qur'ān and Sunnah take you.

I understand there's an opinion of some scholars that Music is permitted, but it is not an opinion people of taṣawwuf generally hold, nor is it a well established opinion, nor is it like a 50/50 split.

Secondly, rulings are not taken from Khidr عليه السلام. For one, scholars differ on whether he is alive or not. Thirdly, he cannot abrogate the Sharī'ah, even if he is alive. Even scholars who hold some forms of music to be permissible (which is an incredibly small minorit of scholars) do not derive this proof from taking secondary sources, but they move to the prophet ﷺ, companions, and the followers and use the Uṣūl of their school. 

From the companions we have things like the Prophet ﷺ arriving in Madīnah and the people singing to him etc. But these are not to be used as blanket approvals that music is good to go. It's viewed in light of all other aḥādīth. Anyway, these are non issues. Whether music is permitted or not is not the issue I care about - I would just like to ask you to not attribute this opinion, since the majority of the major ṣūfī Ṭurūq do not hold the opinion that Music is good to go; Shādhilīs, the Naqshbandīs, Chishtīs, Ashrafīs, etc. they are all simply forms of spiritual rectification and they are not capable of changing the law, and they don't speak about the law, except in applying it.

The foundations of our Ṭarīqa are five:

• Taqwā - Mindfulness of Allāh, privately and publicly

• Adherence to the Sunnah in word and deed.

• Indifference to whether others accept or reject one

242,"Yes, those are schools of law and its interpretation and application.

In regards to Aqīdah (beliefs), Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamā'ah all have the same beliefs in regards to God, his prophets عليهم السلام, his angels, books etc. However on very minor issues, scholars have differed. One example is people who haven't heard of Islam - will they go to Heaven straight away, will they be tested, what conditions are there if so, etc? Scholars have differed on this. You will find Imām al Ghazālī, Shaykh ul Islām Ibn Taymīyyah, etc all differ on this. For example, Maturīdis generally believe that reason is sufficient to attain Tawḥīd, and so a Mushrik in the lands of x might not know whether pork is intrinsically bad for you or not, but he knows whether stealing is, or isn't, and whether murder is good or bad, and also whether God exists or not. They say these are things the intellect can be made to acquire. So if he is a thief, then he will be held accountable for that, since theft is universally or by reason known to be evil. He can't claim ignorance for that on the day of judgement.  

Just some copy paste stuff of differences between the Ash'arīs and the Maturīdis:

&gt; (1)    Ash’aris believe that if God willed He could in principle punish the obedient and reward the disobedient, since He is free do anything, however He has promised though revelation to reward the obedient and punish the disobedient; while the Maturidis believe that he must in principles reward the obedient and punish the disobedient, and that His doing the opposite is absurd;
(2)    Ash’aris believe that man is responsible to believe in God because of revelation, not merely because he is endowed with human reason, and that he has no responsibility prior to revelation, while Maturidis believe that man is responsible to believe in God even before revelation, by the mere fact of having reason;
(3)    Ash’aris believe that divine attributes of agency such as creation, giviging life, giving death, resurrection the dead and so forth, are temporal; while the Maturidis believe they all are manifestations of a single beginnglessly eternal attribute termed “existentiation” (takwin);
(4)    Ash’aris believe that God’s own beginninglessly eternal speech may be heard, while the Maturidis believe it may not;
(5)    Most Ash’aris believe that in principle God may impose moral obligations that man cannot endure, while Maturidies believe this impossible; though both agree that in practice He never does;
(6)    Ash’aris hold two views about the possibility of prophets committing lesser sins that are not sordid: the first being that they are possiblie for them to absentmindedly commit, while the second it that they are not.  The Maturidis say this is impossible, and that they are divinely protected from both enormities and lesser sins, a position that Taj al-Subki concurs with (Tabaqat al Shafi’iyya al kubra, 3.386-388)

Anyway - these are minor differences that do not impact on ones īmān and belief in God, they're non issues, so all three schools fall still within the fold of Sunnī Islām. It is best not to delve into them too much because you won't gain anything from it. More important it is to know how to do wudhū, and read Qur'ān correctly etc. 

For the record, many deviant sects in Aqīdah do exist, such as the Karramīyyah, Qadarīyyah, Jahmīyyah etc etc - and they blatantly contradicted Orthodox Sunnī schools in huge and very important areas so they are put outside the fold of Sunnī Islām. They are sects. The aforementioned schools of Aqīdah (Atharī, Ash'arī, and Maturīdī) only differ in minor aspects, and you'll find many scholars who held to the Ash'arī creed, many that held to the Atharī creed, and many who held to the Maturīdī creed - they are near indistinguishable from eachother because they are minor issues.

1. They specifically recognized the validity of all 8 Mathhabs (legal schools) of Sunni, Shi’a andIbadhi Islam; **of traditional Islamic Theology (Ash’arism)**; of Islamic Mysticism (Sufism), and of true Salafi thought, and came to a precise definition of who is a Muslim.

Based upon **this definition** they forbade takfir (declarations of apostasy) between Muslims. (Aka anyone that's outside of Sunni schools of Aqīdah is upon kufr - since Sunnī Aqīdah is only that of the Atharīs, Ash'arīs and the Matūrīdīs)

Based upon the Mathahib they set forth the subjective and objective preconditions for the issuing of fatwas, thereby exposing ignorant and illegitimate edicts in the name of Islam.

--------

On Wikipedia you can see who signed these statements. Two people who endorsed the 'Ammān message are for example Muftī Taqī Usmānī and Shaykh Nūḥ Ḥa Mīm Keller. I want you to google their name + ""on Shī'a"". For the latter you'll find a video speaking about the bid'ah of the Shī'a, and as for Muftī Taqī he has written many Fatāwā on the Shī'a, he's a well respected scholar all over the world, and he's a spiritual leader in several Ṣūfī Ṭarīqas (Naqshbandī, Chishtī, Ashrafīyyah and one more I can't recall) and he's a major Faqīh - many Islamic finance banking systems in Asia are based upon outlines of books he has written and he's at the head of Sharī'ah council of many of those banks. And he is of the same opinion that the Shī'a as a whole are Muslim but upon grave kufr and misguidance, although he says we shouldn't make takfīr upon the laymen specifically.

The 'Ammān message is about tolerance and cooperation with laymen - it is not an acceptance of the validity of Shī'a Aqīdah in any form. Sunnī scholars still when asked about it will admit to the kufr of Shī'a Aqīdah. (There is a very fine line between one who does kufr/holds kufr beliefs, and one who is an actual kāfir.)",2016-09-15 17:14:33+00:00,d7o1kpg,9.0,t1_d7nz960,2882.0,islam

But their Takfīr will be mainly upon Shī'a scholars, and not the lay folk, as the scholars beliefs differ from the laymen. The fatwas cited speaks about the kufr of those who hold some of the views stated.

358,"&gt; Just cause I question Islam I have a blind heart?

No. Many pose questions. But when they are answered, they humble themselves. You claimed Islam wants us to live hermit lifestyles and to 'abandon' the world - I quoted to you Islamic scholars that absolutely disagreed. You said what I quoted is ""devoid of actual experience."" and that it is ""all an allegation."" Absolute nonsense. Apparently how you practised was what this religion actually is, and what the scholars say it is, is simply ""all an allegation."" Give me a break, humble yourself. You might have left the Salafist movement, but the arrogance has remained within you. You make your statements, then when you are given arguments against it and your positions are refuted, you move on to the next topic. That's a sign of arrogance, not of humbleness. Humbleness is to admit you are wrong.

&gt; I read more of the salaf than you

What does it mean to read ""more of the salaf""? Do you even understand what the word Salaf means? That's now how you use the word in a sentence, the sentence doesn't make sense. Salaf means predecessors. It's not a list of books. Frankly I think you just threw yourself into the deep end and had no guidance from actual scholars. You read a fatwa on the internet, read a book here and there, and thought you knew everything of this religion. Did you actually study under Ibn Baz? No you read his fatwas online, and decided to implement them however you wished. Ask yourself - how did your approach to this religion differ from the scholars? Did you know any that you regularly sat with? Did you talk with them? Do the know of your lifestyle, your cultural values, etc? Not every Faqih answers things the same - it is different from person to person, as is evident from several statements from the scholars.

Imam Malik was asked, “Can knowledge be taken from a man who has not [to his credit any] seeking [of knowledge] nor sitting [with scholars]?”  He said, “No.” [Reported by al-Suyuti in “Is`af al-Mubatta’]

Ibn Rushd said, “In the early age, knowledge was in the hearts of men, and therafter, it was transcribed onto the skins of animals, but the keys to it remained in the hearts of men.” [Quoted by al-Shatibi in “al-Muwafaqat”]

&gt; It is clear to me I am speaking to a child devoid of real life experience. You are in for a rude awakening when you actually step out int he real world.

And it is I that was arrogant? You call me a ""child devoid of real life experience"" and claim it's you that has reached enlightenment? Look at yourself - is this the person you wish to be? What have you done to yourself? You let your desires overcome you, then you started justifying them, and finally you rejected the entire religion. Now, you look down upon anyone and everyone as seen from your saying...

&gt; Anyways, I hope that one day your father marries another woman and when your mother get's angry about it. Tell your mom, ""Mother, your arguments are weak and easily refuted"".

while I was the one wishing you best and wishing you peace and conversing to you even though I am under no such obligation. I didn't need to type this whole Reddit comment, I didn't need to get out my books to quote you what the scholars said. I didn't need to do any of that. I was sincerely trying to help you, but you're calling me ""drunk on kool aid"", ""a child devoid of real life experience"", and all this other nonsense, while of course it was *you* who had *""the best upbringing in Islam""* and it was *you* who *""prayed more""* than me. Where did all this anger come from? To someone that was trying to help you? 

For the record, my father passed away in 2005. May the Most High have mercy on Him.

Maybe if you pray for his peace, the Most High will give you what you threw away through continuous sin and kufr.

366,"Imām Mālik said that Zuhd was Taqwā.

Ibn Uyayna said that Zuhd is ""To do without what Allāh has proscribed. **As for what He has declared lawful, He has permitted it.** Thus, the prophets ate, drank, and married.""

And Ibn Shihāb az Zuhrī said that Zuhd is to ""Not let the forbidden overcome your patient self-restraint, or the permitted your thankfulness.""

The narrations are plenty, and I can give more, but this should suffice - Zuhd is to remove the world from your heart, it is still permissible to use it. And in fact in many aḥādīth the Prophet ﷺ compared this world to a vessel i.e. We should use it as much as we can to get to the ākhirah, and it was said about Sa'īd Ibn al Musayyib that he would only work and get rich just so he could spend on the poor, and one ṣaḥābī would ask Allāh to give him lots of wealth as he used to say ""little is not wholesome for me, and I am not wholesome for it.""

They didn't do this because they wanted the Dunyā - they wanted it so they could spend on people for the sake of Allāh. So they could have food, education, etc etc.

Secondly that ḥadīth you're mentioning is completely out of context - that's about Amr bil Ma'rūf Wa nahī anil Munkar, not about excessiveness in religion. 

Because your slaves are treated better than any girlfriend. Firstly they are clothed with your clothing and fed with your food - so they are as your family. Secondly, you're not allowed to abuse them, if they want freedom, then you need to give them money and give them freedom. It is not comparable at all to western slavery and plantation pickers. How was it that Islamic society the Mughals, who were slaves, became kings? Because Islam removes anything that makes you almost think a slave is one. I recommend you check out Omar Suleiman's vid on slavery and what it actually is from the Islamic perspective. And what is a girlfriend? Someone you temporarily like and hope to live with? What does that even mean? Just use eachother, no tie of promises. I used to know a guy that would say he'll just see what happens. As if this girl he's been dating for the past year is just another encounter. Islam is about a promise of commitment. Some stay together for 10 years and still say they ""don't need a ring to show they're committed"" - what a joke. They might love eachother and might even say it, but they're not willing to actually make that promise verbally. They removed God from the equation so the only that matters is whether they're having fun or not. Their principles are temporal, they'll throw it out for tomorrow's principles. 

You do know there is a ḥadīth in al Adab al a mufrad where Abū Bakr says his izār slips and the Prophet ﷺ said that it's fine because ""you don't do it out of arrogance."" The threat was severe because in that society it Many of the rich did lower their garment on purpose.

378,"&gt; But these questions eat away at me and pretty much solidify my atheism

It is not the questioning itself that is establishing your atheism - since hundreds of Islamic scholars constantly are in a state of questioning.

And every question you can think of, has been thought of before, and has been answered before.

Most of those questions, you can find answers to by using the search bar here, attending Islamic seminars by scholars, or reading some books here and there. They're relatively easy to answer.

&gt; ""lightly beat""

You can ""lightly beat"" them symbolically - scholars have commented on the verse saying you use a miswak (a toothbrush, essentially) or a piece of paper. The idea is to show that you have ''had it up to here'' and even then it's supposed to be a final solution. There is no scholar on this planet that actually permits spousal abuse or domestic abuse. In the Mālikī madhab a woman can divorce her husband for so much as calling her a ""dog"" or a ""cow."" Do you think a man has ever come to a scholar about an issue with his wife and the scholar has said, ""Hmm, have you tried beating her? It says in this chapter..."" No that's ridiculous. The interpretation of the verse already exists, and the orthodox position is that we don't ""reinterpret"" verses however way we want. So if the scholars (which includes the Companions of our Beloved Prophet SAW) have interpreted it as a blade of grass, or a toothbrush, or a piece of paper, then we do not reinterpret things into ""Oh it means spousal abuse"" and what have you. That's ignorant.

419,"I understand that you love it, and that you don't want to go for religious reasons - just for the communal feel. But officially, Mass is a Christian thing - regardless of whether Christians go there for religious reasons or social reasons. For example, Muslims don't partake in Halloween either. Nobody in American believes in Ghosts or Vampires and they just celebrate it for fun, as an opportunity for kids. But Muslims don't partake in it because of its Pagan roots. 

So when (or if) you decide to become Muslim, deeply ask yourself why you wish to become Muslim. Is it because you believe that Messengers were sent from God, who is One? (peace be upon them all) - Is it because you want to experience something new in life? Is it because you're looking for a new clique? People have all sorts of reasons for wanting to become Muslim, so assess why you wish to become Muslim. And then base your decisions upon that - that's what Muslims do. When we bow down to God 5x a day, we are reminding ourselves that we are people who do not steal, we don't lie, we don't commit Shirk (making partners with God, or saying he has sons/fathers). The Indians of India, who are Muslim, don't partake in Holi - which is a very big festival for Hindus there. Very colourful, very fun, etc. etc. But it's not of our tradition, and it is not legislated by our religion.

If you feel it's too hard to leave it, that's fine. You can wean yourself off of it - but I'm just trying to make you understand that becoming Muslim doesn't mean you have to leave everything behind - of course not - being Muslim should compliment your former culture and lifestyle, not abolish it - but at the same time there are some things here and there you have to give up. 

Islamic law is very deep and comprehensive. Amongst other things, you'll have to eat halal slaughtered meat, you can only marry a Muslim man, prevent having forbidden income (i.e. working in fields of Interest in bank, or working in wine shops or whatever) - these are all sorts of hurdles in the step to becoming Muslim that you have to gradually implement. You can't for example, marry a Christian who's fine with you becoming Muslim - under the law everytime you two would be together intimately, you'd be committing Zina (adultery). Becoming Muslim is about changing ourselves to a better form of ourselves - we can't change the law to fit what we want it to be.  Muslims are very strict with this. Some women just cover most of their hair, showing a bit at the front - this isn't Hijab for Muslims. Or some people will drink something because it has only a very low % of alcohol - still forbidden. I am not trying to make Islam seem restrictive, it isn't, but there are key parts of our lives we have to reform for it. Anyway, do keep questioning and seeking answers, but I hope I'm just being clear in how Islam is approached by people. ",2016-09-07 10:06:01+00:00,d7cme8e,9.0,t1_d7c7ilm,33710.0,islam

429,"&gt; Question: The question is the permissibility of drawings for say educational purposes I have read the reliance and agree with what Sh. Nuh mentions, but it  doesn’t mention for example the ruling on drawing for educational purposes I am aware that there is ikhtilaf [difference of opinion] on this issue, but could u assist us in clarifying this? E.g. The science teacher at our school was asking what it be possible to draw say the body- to label organs e.g. heart, liver etc or say the eye- in detail, cornea, iris etc. We would like a common policy, in order not to confuse the students.

&gt; Answer: In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful

&gt; Walaikum assalam,

&gt; In the name of Allah, the inspirer of truth. All praise is to Allah, Most Merciful and Compassionate, and all blessings and peace to our Master Muhammad, his family, companions, and those who follow them.

&gt;What is strongly impermissible is to draw the entire human body with all its details, or the face and neck with all its details (except when necessary for immediate educational purposes and the like).

&gt;As for drawing an outline of the human body, without detailed features, and labeling the various parts, or drawing the details of a particular part (such as the heart), this is permitted, and this is not disliked if for a reasonable purpose (such as education).

&gt;It is mentioned in Imam `Ala al-Din al-Haskafi’s al-Durr al-Mukhtar that, among the types of pictures that are not prohibited to have are those that are:

&gt;“(Small) such that the details of their limbs are not apparent to someone who looks down at them standing while they are on the ground, as Halabi mentioned, (or with their head or face cut off) or with an organ effaced out that the body cannot live without, (or of an inanimate object).”

&gt;Ibn Abidin clarified in his supercommentary, Radd al-Muhtar:

&gt;“(His saying “with their head cut off”) That is, whether it did not have a head in the first place, or it had one and it was effaced.” [Radd al-Muhtar` ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, Babma yufsidal-salatwama yukrahufiha]

&gt;And Allah knows best.

&gt;Wassalam,
Faraz Rabbani.

3. This is a very deep question and I am afraid of giving you an answer. So I won't. But I will tell you what my approach is - I always show dedication to my Ṣalāh and make sure they notice it.

This can not be explained in a Reddit comment but essentially there is an entire science to it.

506,"No problem! May Allāh 'azza wa jal make it easy for you. For the record, my stance is not even that it's obligatory to cover the face - I'm only saying the school's official position.

Musa Furber is a Shafi'ī Muftī and here's an article where he provides the official position of the Shafi'ī school on Niqāb. - http://musafurber.com/2016/07/16/comment/

It also says the Hanbalī school's position is the same - though it doesn't provide any evidence for this. That said, you can just look at Saudi Arabia right now, and they base their Fiqh on the book of Ibn Quḍāmā who was a Hanbalī scholar - and everyone there covers their face.

This is an outline of the Hanafī position on the covering of the face and it cites Imām Muhammad himself (Muhammad ibn Hasan ash Shaybānī is one of the two major students of Abū Hanīfa himself). - https://www.deoband.org/2009/04/contemporary-voices/the-niqab-and-its-obligation-in-the-hanafi-madhhab/

So you will see they don't actually consider the face awrah, but they do consider it necessary to cover it - for other reasons.

Here is another comprehensive article if that one doesn't suffice: http://seekershub.org/ans-blog/2010/09/19/a-detailed-exposition-of-the-fiqh-of-covering-ones-nakedness-awra/",2016-08-19 10:37:16+00:00,d6nvqfb,8.0,t1_d6nq178,17511.0,islam

508,"It's definitely wrong on the Shafi'ī school. Yes it is true that the opinion of Imām Shafi'ī himself was that the face is not awrah but majority of later Shafi'i scholars (aka the official position of the school) opined that it *is* obligatory to cover the face.

For the opinion of the Hanafīs they generally don't consider the face necessarily awrah but they believe it's obligatory to cover it in situations of fitnah, and they believe majority of today is issues relating to fitnah so they believe it's obligatory to cover now.

Anyway, what you should know is that scholars within the school can differ but this encyclopaedia doesn't give a righteous view because fiqh is not that simple. 

Just as an example, Sadl is the official position of prayer within the Mālikīs school and it is the mash-hūr opinion (well known/famous). But big scholars from within the school such as Qāḍī Ayyād differ and believe that Qabd is the Sunnah, not Sadl. Then scholars differ according to what they define as qabd, whether it is obligatory, Sunnah, mubah, what type of prayer etc etc.

Likewise for the Shafi'īs - the opinion of the Imām is that it is not obligatory to cover the face. Later Shafi'īs do believe it's obligatory to cover the face.

Two places where shafiis live: Malaysia and Yemen. The Yemenis follow the opinion of the later scholars (Subki etc) whereas Malaysia probably follows Imām Shafi'ī his opinion himself.

531,"&gt; Just that a lot of the terrorist attacks recently have been committed by people who considered themselves Muslims. Which is 100% true.

It might be true, but it's absolutely irrelevant. The Ummah as a whole dissociates themselves from any and all of these terrorist groups. 

This man however, came as a representative of Israel in the field of a particular sport.

&gt; is it right to blame the majority for the acts of a minuscle minority?

Red herring. People who live in Israel support the nation state and its actions, and people who come to wrestle on behalf of Israel *especially endorse the state* since they come to represent it. 

Those terrorist attacks occurring are in no way associated with us.

Show me how the two situations are similar? You're comparing Daesh, an offshoot terrorist group that some of the Ulema don't even consider Muslim because of their Khawaarij traits, VS Israel, a nation state that commits systematic oppression of the Palestinian people. Not. At. All. Similar. So no, it's not right to blame the majority for the acts of the minority, but in the case of Israel, the population of Israel supports the state of Israel and endorses its actions, so it is justified in this case, because it's not a majority being blamed for a minority. It's a majority being blamed for the majority. 

&gt; The same defense is used by people who say racist shit about Muslims and then defend themselves by saying Muslims aren't a race.

They're not irrelevant, and they're not unnecessary.

&gt; Is it right to blame all Muslims not involved in those events for the acts of the criminal ones? 

Again, this is not at all similar to Israel, which is a country that has stolen land and oppresses the people of Israel. Since when are Muslims a country.

Your statement would be more correct if it said

&gt; Is it right to blame Daesh suppporters not involved in those events for the acts of the criminal ones? 

Then absolutely we should blame them, because they support that that, even if they are not directly involved.

If the matter was as you said, then even the Devil was a Muslim because he too affirmed that Allah is one, and Muhammad is his messenger. I'm on my phone, but check out the last 2 ayaat of Surah Baqarah - we accept the reality of all the messengers, and to remove some of them from prophethood is a a kufr by which you exit Islam.

609,"The article doesn't want to debate the actual validity of the views, but it says ""such a persons fatwas can not be taken from"".

&gt; One may find the statements of al-Awzā‘ī and Qādī Ismā‘īl somewhat harsh – as these opinions are, after all, opinions held by **some scholars**, no matter how aberrant and strange. But the reason they gave this harsh judgement is because this practice – of selecting marginal and fringe views of certain scholars – is a form of belittling the Dīn/treating the Dīn lightly (istihāna bi l-dīn), which can take a person out of Islām. (See: Mu‘īd al-Ni‘am, Dār al-Kitāb al-‘Arabī, p. 102)

It didn't say the views were invalid (except the fasting one) but said they were strange and aberrant. Which shows there is room for disagreement. 

And you're quite wrong. Most scholars, do advocate people to take the deen easy, and if they see someone overly strict they'll be lenient with them; converts are told to just pray once a day and slowly build it up, some scholars allow eating of the meat of Christian and Jews in the west despite the fact they're not really practising etc etc.  So likewise, when people tend to make things easy upon themselves, then naturally the scholars make sure they're not just taking strange opinions wherever they can find them.

Note also whether Mufti Abu Layth *seriously* thinks he's following the strongest opinion or not, is not the concern of Mufti Zameel. His concern is with the people that follow him, and he's advising them to not take his opinions, because he sticks to non-mainstream opinions. People that follow mufti Abu Layth don't know his reasoning for every position that he holds so they can't believe that's the ""stronger"" opinion.",2016-07-19 13:04:48+00:00,d5i2xbr,4.0,t1_d5i2edw,1028.0,islam

If you base your religion upon strange and distorted opinions, your deen will be strange and distorted. Of course, there is room for disagreement, no doubt, but there are even limits to that.

654,"&gt; I just feel that one can't truly be a Muslim without knowing the Arabic Language, at least when praying at the Mosque, and listening to the selected passage portion of the prayer. Do you feel the same way? 

Not at all. Tawheed is first in the heart - and then it is expounded by further research. That's why Converts first learn about God's oneness, and what it means, and then about the Prophets and the message they were sent with etc. Then you can clarify what the message sums up, and slowly you'll learn words (shamsu wal qamar) and (samaawaati wal ard) etc. You don't need to know the Arabic translation right in that moment - but you need to know why you're standing there, and for whom. 

As for your second point - no doubt, but I don't feel the need to change my tradition just because someone else refuses to learn something for themselves. I will use Allah, and if they are curious, then I will explain, and most often I will explain anyway, but if I were to do a translation of the Qur'an, I would not render it God, because I don't feel I need to change how I perceive things just because other people *willingly* are arrogant. I'm talking about the average racist person, the average normal atheist just doesn't care, regardless of whether we believe in Tawheed or a Triune God, so to them saying Allah or God doesn't matter too much.

662,"The word Allah, in the MAS Abdel Haleem translation, is rendered God. Some translations do choose to go for God, for the sake of convenience for the readers. 

Others stick to Allah, because Allah is the most perfect of names of the Most High - it represents perfect Tawheed. In English, when you say you believe in God, some people question you - the sun God? The moon God? Do you believe in the God of the Pagans? Jesus as the triune God? The Holy Spirit? And sometimes they will question the attributes this God has - such as the Pharaonic Gods having dog heads, is your God human? Did God rest? 

See - by saying God, people have their own concepts that they want to attach to this idea of God. By saying Allah, yes it might scare some off at first (unless they get over their fear, and just read a bit more into it), but at least it presents a clear message of who God really is. And that is the most important thing in the entirety of Islam. 

What are the most important commandments in Islam? To believe in Allah, your sole creator, sustainer, maintainer, of everything in the heavens and the earth, the one who is the Most Merciful, the one who has set up laws for us, and so on, and so forth. Belief is the very basis of this religion. Allah in the Qur'an always says ''Those who believe AND do righteous deeds.'' - because to be righteous, you must have some sort of inkling of belief in that there is such a thing as objective righteousness - and that objective righteousness can only come from one who is Objective, who sets limits, but is not limited himself in any sort of way. Belief is the very basis for the submission to God (aka being Muslim), for how can you submit yourself, without knowing to *whom* you're submitting yourself?

If you read some books, you will see they sometimes do explain who Allah is.

&gt; the Albanians will repeat selected passages for the sake of convenience

It might be that they don't have a haafidh that's memorized the entirety of the Qur'an, so they stick to shorter passages. 

Also, for example, according to Imam Malik the last 1/60th of the Qur'an is sunnah to recite during your prayers, so some for those reasons recite the last portionsof the Qur'an. 

&gt; An English-Islamic Mosque, or Whichever language. Where the prayers during Salat are read in the translated language of choice meant for a full understanding of the faith; and those praying are encouraged to learn the Arabic Language in the meantime in order to prepare them to read the Quran in the original Arabic, etc.

This would invalidate the prayer. Not a single scholar on the planet has ever validated such an act. With all due respect, if they wish to know what is being read, they should read a translation before/afterwards, or - a lot of scholars recommend learning Arabic here and there, knowing keywords, which helps immensely in our understanding of the Qur'an. I say this as a non Arab myself. 

How often does the Qur'an itself say ''This is an Arabic recitation (Qur'anan Arrabiyyan'' - if we were to change to English, then they are no longer the words of Allah. In fact - how often these 'translations' are called ''interpretations'' because the people doing the translations realize they can't fully translate it to English, it's why there's over 100s of different translations, each of them differing by just a little bit here and there. The specificity of the words in Arabic is incredible, and I recommend you learn about the beauty of it, and you'll be able to appreciate it more and more.

I recommend you watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaS5NsvZ4yM

Islam it self has no language barriers, I've got English convert friends that don't speak a word of Arabic, and we get along fine. Yes, you use the word Fajr or Sunnah or Taraweeh or Masjid etc. here and there, but those are a tiny arrangement of words that you get used to as you learn Islam. Then when it comes to Qur'an, you memorize a portion, and you reflect upon that portion, and in Taraweeh, you enjoy the melodious recitation of the Qur'an.",2016-07-04 14:12:12+00:00,d4ys2ov,1.0,t3_4r6uw1,9011.0,islam

A man once didn't attend the Fajr Jamaah and Umar Ibn al Khattab notices this, went to his house where a relative told Umar that the man prayed all night and as such was so tired for Fajr that he just prayed it at home, at which Umar remarked that him praying Fajr in Jama'ah would've been better than him praying all night alone. I realize this is talking in terms of rewards, but what I'm trying to say is that there is a big distinction made between nafl and fard prayers.

I recommend setting time down every day to read 10 minutes of Quran, and praying as usual, try to fast at the very least every 13th, 14th, and 15th of the month. As for your family, be kind to them and try to serve them in many aspects. If they know you're Muslim, let them know you want to come with them, but feel uncomfortable inside the church, and that you'd rather wait outside.

Take it upon yourself to cook for your family, sit with your mother every 3-4 nights and discuss her life growing up etc. Try to show interest in her life, be curious. Be grateful to God together etc. 

Remember that before the prayer was prescribed, enjoining ties of kinship, and servings the parents was prescribed. Don't let your self think these are acts wasted, or you could be watching a Mufti Menk lecture or something, lol. Rather, every moment you spend with family, with the intention to please ﷲ, is an act of Ibaadah (worship) towards Him.

Every morning after Fajr, sit down for 3 minutes, say SubhanAllah WA bihamdihi and plant 100 trees in Jannah. 

Everytime you enter a room, intend that you forgive and love everyone in that room. Every night when you sleep, intend to forgive and love everytime that you interact with.

Remember to read some Quran everyday, 5 minutes of reading, 5 minutes of reflection. Conscious reflection.

REMAINING IN THE HOME DURING’IDDAH
1. During the period of ‘iddah the bereaved wife should remain in the dwelling that they occupied at the time of the demise of her husband. It is not permissible (Haraam) for her to leave this house if she has sufficient provision.
2. If she is the sole bread winner with no other means of income then only is she permitted to leave her house during the day to seek her livelihood. She must return to this house before nightfall and as soon as she has completed this duty during the day.
3. It is not required that she confines herself to a certain room or that she remains silent during the ‘iddah. She should preferably occupy herself with ibaadah or any virtuous act. She may carry out any house work. She must not indulge in any sinful activity or pas- time.
4. She may leave the house for unavailable or emergency medical treatment, but should return immediately thereafter. If the distance to such services exceeds the limit of safar (77.25 km or 48 miles) she must be accompanied by a Mahram (a male member of the family whom she cannot marry by Islamic Law).
5. She may not leave the borne to visit the ill or go to a place where there is a funeral, though they be close’ relatives or even immediate neighbours.
6. She may move to another house if she cannot find sufficient accommodation in the deceased’s house by virtue of her inheritance from him, and if the remaining heirs do not allow her the use of her hus- band’s house or she is unable to observe the lslamic required purdah.
7. If the husband dies in a rented house, then if the surviving wife is able to pay the rent she must observe her ‘iddah in the same house. When she is unable to pay the rent she may move to the nearest available safe place where she must now complete her ‘iddah.
8. In case she is the sole occupant of the house where the ‘iddah has to be passed and the fear of being alone is so great that it is unbearable, so as to cause mental ill health or defect, she may shift to another house. Where the fear is not unbearable it will not be per- missible to move.
9. If the dwelling where she is residing is in a dilapidated condition and there is a risk that it may collapse or when it is insecure and there is a real threat to her chastity, honour or life, she may shift to another house, but she has to return to her home as soon as the cause of danger is removed.

It is the safer position to hold, and in light of the ahadith it is the more sensible opinion to hold. Consider the logical explanation of not being able to put in your private part, but being able to put in your mouth and fingers, how does that make sense? Anyway, may ﷲ ﷻ make it easy for you bro. Remember that ﷲ hasn't made everything haraam, rather everything is halal, just some things have been drawn a border around and we've been told to restrict ourselves from it., and we'll find plenty of things within the border that we can inshaAllah enjoy.

849,"&gt; the byzantines or the persians could not take over arabia because they were busy fighting each other. fighting a war on two fronts would have severely weakened them and in fact was the cause of their eventual defeats to the rashidun caliphate

No it wouldn't - the Arabian peninsula was in a state of disarray and there was no formalized army to begin with. It was small tribes here and there, and that would be, for the Byzantine empire, an easy thing to defeat. 

&gt; it does not matter how large the enemy army is when you have allah on your side. the prophet (nor ali for that matter) never turned his back in any battle no matter what the odds were. 

Yes but you tie your camel first. When Khaalid ibn Waleed had trouble fighting the Byzantine empire, he asked Abu Bakr as Siddeeq to send an army and he sent not an army but a Sahabi - Qa'qa ibn Amr at Tamimi. There is no doubt that Imaan is important - but the Prophet SAW still would not go into a battle without armour and just you know, rely upon ''imaan'' to save the day. He would tie his camel.

&gt; the prophet did not fight before his hijrah because allah had not yet given him permission to do so. it was only after the hijrah that allah permitted the muslims to defend themselves. 

That's very nice, but isn't it already established in the religion that you're allowed to fight back in cases of self defence? Hence his attack would have been justified. But he didn't fight back, and you know it, and I know it.

&gt; i urge you to read sunni sources on this event. dont even read shia sources. this event is widely agreed upon by everyone.

I have read Sunni sources, and they're very clear. Abu Bakr RA did no such thing as ''disobey'' the Prophet SAW. Just because you call it ''widely agreed upon by everyone'' does not make it so. 

&gt; thats great but thats not really relevant.

Firstly, I wholeheartedly agree with the fact theemissary was executed and so they went to fight making perhaps this fight not entirely ''offensive jihad'', but the fact of the matter is that with the size of the Byzantine empire at the time, it would be wholeheartedly foolish to think they could take them on. If the Byzantines had at any time came and conquered the Arabian peninsula, they could have - they were the largest dominating force of the Western world for the past 300-400 years. As were the Persians. To fight them, is a deathwish, even if it means you can avenge your emissary. 

If you're a farmer and the King of rome declares war on you, you would not fight back, unless you know can actually do something about it and change the tides on him. If this was all purely for the sake of defence, they could have killed a Byzantine soldier in retribution and considered themselves ''even'' without having risked losing their entire army to the Byzantine Empire. But they didn't do this, and they actually went to war with the empire.

We Muslims are not some type of ''No guts no glory'' type of people, where we fight, even if it isn't practical. If that was the case, then the Prophet SAW would have fought while in Mecca *while* the Qur'aysh were being violent with him. But he didn't. He SAW went to Medina, raised an army, and fought back.

That said, to say the last expedition was delayed because they ''disobeyed the Prophet SAW'' is such a blatant lie upon the Sahaba and shows grave disrespect to the Prophet SAW. Abu Bakr RA was the first to believe Rasulullah SAW after he came from Israa wal Miraaj and they labelled him as Siddeeq for this, and you want to tell me he *disobeyed* the Prophet SAW because an 18 year old is leading the army? This guy laid down his life for the Prophet SAW and came on the Hijra with him - and he defended him SAW when nobody else could in Mecca, because all the Muslims were of the lower class people. You could make a similar argument for every other Sahabi out there.

Firstly, not every Sahabi fought in every battle. Lets make that clear, just because they didn't partake in a battle does not mean they disobeyed the Prophet SAW - because the Prophet SAW didn't command every Sahabi to fight in every battle. Secondly, when the Prophet SAW passed away, some of the Sahaba (I'm pretty sure it was 'Umar RA) wanted to call Usama back because he had already been sent away to fight, at which Abu Bakr got angry - despite that Umar had good reason to call him back. The tribes of the Arabian peninsula were turning back on Islam and some were even conspiring together to wage war against the Muslims, but Abu Bakr refused to call Usama ibn Zaid back *because* he did not dare overturn the command of the Prophet SAW now he has passed away. And he explicitly mentioned this to 'Umar.

Come on, do you think he likes to Visit your parents with you or take you once a week on a date or something or tries extra much to remember your birthday? These things he might not care about intrinsically but he knows they make *you* happy. Your world view seems to be very self centred. Islam at its very core is sacrifice. Why do we give charity - even though we all love wealth. Why do we love our mother, even when they're harsh with us? Because we work hard for others so they know we appreciate them. I know a guy who every week drives me 2 hours to study with a teacher even though he is a dentist, his wife is in the medical field, he has very little time and he's offered doing this after we met only once. Yesterday a brother looked at me &amp;2 of my friends and he said ""Do you need a ride?"" the brother could have gone home and not bothered, saved himself some gas, time etc. He's never talked me, never seen me, but he offered it out of genuine care and gave us a half hour ride. Heck, not offering the ride wouldn't have even made him a sinner. I'm going to be straight up honest with you - you sound like a selfish person. All of what you seem to mention is about what you feel - and none of it seems to be about what the other feels. And no I'm not saying this because you're a woman and ""you need to take care of your husband and blablabla"" - I'd have said the exact same thing if you were a man neglecting the status and rank of a woman, wife, or mother. Always reassess yourself. 

When I mentioned a woman can divorce the man for not adequately providing for her, you ignored it. And right away jumped on the fact a man can divorce the woman for not wanting to be intimate with her often. Perhaps you are young. But realize that the world is bigger than just ourselves - and especially for Muslims, we always sacrifice ourselves for others. My parents walked thousands of miles through rain, hail, and snow so they could provide me with a life and education. My father would always cook for my mother when she came late from work. My mother would always take care of the kids when my father was at work.

You know why? Because love is sacrifice. If you expect marriage to be some type of journey where he does everything you want and you never do anything he wants, especially the things that are important to *him*, then your journey will come to a quick halt. Stop reading this all as an attack of us telling you to force yourself to do things you might not enjoy so much, and start looking at it like things that make other people happy and you wanting to see them happy.

888,"I used to be like you so I'll just address this

&gt;  angels cursing a women if she doesn't sleep with the man

The fundamental misunderstanding comes from what a Nikah actually constitutes in Islam. In a hadith Rasulullah SAW said that the biggest right of the man within a marriage is that the wife allows him to be intimate with her - and if she doesn't, he can divorce her for that. And the biggest right the woman has in the marriage is that the husband provides for her (with shelter/clothing/food) - and if he doesn't, she can divorce him. 

The reason for these are quite obvious - if the man isn't satisfied, it can lead to other things such as infidelity etc etc. The man has no way to express himself sexually, except within marriage. 

Likewise if we woman isn't provided for it leads to a lot of marital problems within the house, general disarray etc. 

That said, you shouldn't follow Sa'udi shaykhs. With all due respect to them (and I follow some of them myself lol) - they are not your scholars. Where do you live? Go find a local scholar that you trust, and follow them in your rulings. The most important part is that you *trust* them to have done authentic studying of Islam and to understand the circumstances in which you live. They are familiar with your life etc. If you start using 13th century Baghdad fatwas for 21st century England, you'll get a really strange view of Islam. Islam, while the roots etc stay the same, is practised slightly differently here and there depending on your living circumstances, the culture etc. 

That's why Islam isn't practised the same way in Sa'udi as it is in Afghanistan, or in Malaysia, or Mauritania, or in South Africa. 

So find a local scholar that you trust to have done authentic studying of Islam, then follow them in your teachings.

And don't count a hadith as inauthentic simply because you find it confusing - because it might mean you end up ignoring the Sunnah. What would be better to do is to ask a scholar about it, and they could clarify for you whether it is a real hadith, or fabricated, or this, or that.

Is it just ''Okay we're married now'' and they say ''Yes'' and khalas that is your nikah? Can I have sex with my wife during my fast? Also - without the Hadith, you can justify drinking alcohol. The ayaat of the Qur'an in regards to alcohol came consecutively but if you don't have hadith you don't know in which order they came and which ruling actually applies.

When you pray Salah, do you leave out the Salaams at the end? And the Dua? And the Durood? And the Tashahhud? These all have been narrated in ahadith.

Akhi - what has remained of your Salah? 

What do you even recite in it? Do you recite Al Fatiha? Or is it okay to leave al Fatiha out and just recite from surah al Ikhlas or something straight away. 

Do you say Basmala at the start of your Dua? Do you say the Takbeer at the start? Do you say the tashahhud after 2 rakahs? What is a Raka'ah anyway?

What has remained of your Salah?  

Prove to me every single one of these using nothing except the Qur'an.

Fact of the matter is - you don't even know how to give the Adhaan without the hadith - or what the Adhaan is. And you can't tell me why Allah curses a man called Abu Lahab in the Qur'an, surah al Masad. Or who was the Man the Prophet SAW turned away from in Surah Abasa. Without Hadith, you - just like terrorists - can justify attacking and killing. You can be like the Non Muslims and claim that ''Surah Tawbah abrogates everything that occurred in mecca'' and that therefore it is permissible to kill recklessly.

Please go learn Islam, and go learn Ahadith, and do not let yourself be lead astray by these sayings. 

Just because you do not understand something - does not mean it is a lie. 

Without hadith - why do you even follow the man called Rasulullah SAW. In the Qur'an it says people called him a magician, a soothsayer, a crazy person - why would you want to follow him? Only Hadith can prove to you why he wasn't any of that.

Islam says Jesus was the Messenger of God. Christianity says hes the Son of God. You either believe he's the messenger, or the son. If you believe he's both, then you're rejecting verses from the Qur'an (which literally say that Allah does not have any sons). If you accept he's a messenger of God, you will not be a Christian by most accounts of what Christianity amounts to.

Another issue: The Qur'an says ''This day I Have perfected your religion and chosen Islam for you'' in Surah Al Maa'ida - so you cannot call yourself a Christian.

And in the Qur'an it says ''The Jews say X'' and ''The Christians say Y'' - ''Tell them....'' which shows that the Christians are not Muslims.

Islam says that Christianity was right for the time it was in - and it was initially correct, but because nothing of authentic sources etc remains of it - therefore we only base our religion on Islam - the Qur'an &amp; Sunnah.

The main contention is about people who didn't hear the true message of Islam - with all due respect to those who ask it, this applies to people who are gravely misinformed and think we worship the moon i.e. the average Fox news watcher, those that think the Prophet Muhammad PBUH was some kind of warlord.

980,"The Jizya of course. In return they would be protected. This was towards the end of the khilafa of Abu bakr when the Byzantine Empire tried fighting the Muslims. Khalid Ibn Waleed made his way quite cleverly through a central town and on the way any fortresses he would come across he would give three options.

1. Convert and you'll have all the rights we have.
2. Pay the Jizya, and we will protect you (later on one of the fortresses was attacked by the Roman Empire for becoming Muslim and the Muslims returned quickly to help them).
3. Fight us.

The first was preferred for all, in fact one of the fortresses wanted to pay the Jizya to keep on their religion to which Khalid became very angry, because he didn't want their money, he told them he wanted their religion. Anyway, obviously it was their right so he let them stay on their religion. A lot of fortresses did readily accept Islam partly because of the Persian empires collapse and the Roman Empire seeming to go down the spiral aswell. 

That said, a lot of people criticise the Islamic concept of Jizya, not realizing you get jailed if you don't pay taxes even in our western countries here. The Jizya essentially was the binding contract between Muslims and non Muslims, a tit for tat kind of thing, you'll have my back (money) I'll have yours (security), and obviously it is paid in accordance to ones capability. Paganism was widespread in various regions along the borders of Arabia and the Byzantine empire and religion was varied so this upheld a treasty that disregarded those differences.

These fortresses also became back up places in case the armies needed to retreat or group up which they did need to when the emperor of Rome decided to attack one of the armies of the Muslims near Palestine, led by I think, Amr Ibn al Aas.

The Muslims already paid their own money anyway, known as zakaat. One of the reasons the Muslims didn't pay the additional Jizya aswell is because it is assumed that when a Muslim is called upon to fight, he fights. The non Muslims paying Jizya did not need to fight as the money was a guarantee of a protection of their lives, wealth, and family. And additional, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I believe if someone volunteered to fight as a non Muslim in the Muslim army, that they did not need to pay the Jizya.

This doesn't go for people who are Munafiqeen (Hypocrites, pretending to be Muslim outwardly, but don't believe in any of it internally) - they will be eternally punished. 

One of the greatest grievances for the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of God be upon him) is that he was not able to convert his dearest uncle Abu Talib, even on his deathbed. Abu Talib knew Islam was the truth, but when he wanted to convert on his deathbed, Abu Lahab (or Abu Jahl, can't remember) was like ''Are you going to turn back on the religion of your forefathers?'' and so he didn't say the Shahada, but he passed. 

The Prophet SAW himself said that because he was so kind to him on this planet, God has given him the least of the punishment in the fire, and still he will probably think he's been given the most punishment. 


 Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported: A mention was made of his uncle Abu Talib before the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) He said: My intercession may benefit him on the Day of Resurrection and he may be placed in the shallow part of the Fire which would reach his ankles and his brain would be boiling.  [Sahih Muslim]

This was the man who supported his nephew when everyone was rejected him and refused to trade with the Banu Haashim tribe etc. etc. He also knew of the miracles his nephew did, and he knew of the proofs and dedication the Prophet PBUH had. But he did not convert. The Prophet PBUH wanted him to convert because he loved him so much..

1116,"What determines whether someone is the right person to marry? Is it when their values match up with ours? In a sense, yes, and in a sense no. 

As Muslims we believe in Allah, and we believe in his Prophets (peace be upon them) his books, and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH specifically.

The Prophet PBUH told us that when a man marries, he can marry a woman for four things: Her beauty, her wealth, her status, or her religion - and the best of us, are those who marry for religion. 

So when we marry, we tend to look at someone and think.. How are they in their daily life? Do they pray? Do they love God? Do they wish to go Hajj sometime, do they love visiting the mosque, do they have beard/hijab etc. These are primary attributes, after that we start looking at secondary characteristics: Are they funny? Are they engaging to talk with? Can I imagine myself being with them?

These are important things to think about, hobbies et al don't need to necessarily match at all, because so long as the core is functionable, the rest will work itself out. From our religion, we are commanded to be gentle to our wives, to be kind to them, likewise women are told to be sweet and kind to their husbands. When we are good to people, the good is only reciprocated. When someone will fulfil the rights of God, then they will extra so make sure that they fulfil the rights of humans. 

And if I have a wife that has a for example unibrow (or something) I cannot stand, or x or y, then I can overlook that fact for a ton of reasons, because she has a sparkle in her eye every time she laughs, or because she is beautiful whenever you see her raise her hands to the sky and ask of God of all his riches. 

As Muslims, you realize nobody is perfect, so you decide to overlook the smaller things (worldly things) for the fact the bigger things are more important (religious related things)

As for getting to know them, usually there is a brief period of the guy and girl talking to each other, just 1 or 2 or 3 meetings between the guy and the girl and someone from the girl's family (i.e. her father) chaperoning to make sure everything being talked about is beneficial, and not that the guy tries to be a sleaze or whatever. These meetings help the guy and girl talk about things that are important and what they would want in their husband/wife and from there they can decide whether they like or don't like each other. 

Marriage is not about falling lustfully in love with each other - marriage is a union in which you decide to work together, for the greater good, for the love of Allah, so that you might come closer to another person He loves.",2016-02-24 08:38:39+00:00,d0br5s1,1.0,t3_47bjze,1734.0,islam

Legally speaking the term ""Narcotic"" is, today, imprecisely defined and typically has negative connotations.[1][2]

&gt;  In English and many other languages, the masculine form has traditionally served as the default or unmarked form; that is, masculine pronouns have been used in cases where the referent or referents are not known to be (all) female. This leads to sentences such as: If anybody comes, tell **him**. Here the masculine pronoun him refers to a person of unknown sex.

Yes you're allowed to find your own meaning from the Qur'an i.e. interpret it for yourself IF and only IF you stay within the Shari'ah of Islam. 

Perhaps you read an Ayah and you think ''Hmm.. Wait a second, that is pretty interesting!'' and you might be the first person to make that connection, that's cool. So long as you do not discount other people's interpretation of the ayah and so long as it does not go against the direct meaning of the ayah and so long as it does not go against the Shari'ah.

I'll give you a blatant example, I know someone who read the ayah of cutting someone's hand off for stealing (5:38) and said you can ''cut their hand off'' by imprisoning them i.e. they are cut off from the world and can't do any more harm.  He said the Ulema just never understood the verse correctly, and that this is the correct interpretation. This is clearly BS because the Sahaba etc weren't misguided, they knew how to apply the verse, and the verse is literal (though it has its restrictions and shouldn't be applied unless absolutely absolutely absolutely necessary). But this would be an interpretation that is not within the Shari'ah and has no substance. But lets say you read the verse of the Heavens and the Earth being split apart and you say hey that's pretty cool, sounds like the Big Bang, or you say, hey that's pretty cool, it reminds me of [x] or [y], you can make those interpretations so long as your interpretation does not contradict the shari'ah and you do not believe it is the only correct interpretation. 

So yes, do read the Qur'an, and do try to understand it. What is Allah SWT trying to tell you? ",2016-01-21 16:39:05+00:00,cz6n0um,3.0,t1_cz5d8kt,84783.0,islam

1235,"I recommend learning from all. 

I have studied under some Sufi teachers and also Salafi teachers. By combining the both you reach some sort of middle ground. 

Imam ash Shafi'i, the famous Imam of the madhab wrote the following poem

&gt; 
فقيها و صوفيا فكن ليس واحدا فإني و حق الله إياك فانصح
 فذالك قاس لم يذق قلبه تقي و هذا جهول كيف ذو الجهل يصلح 


“Faqih and Sufi – be neither one nor the other
 So I with the right of Allah to you give this advice

&gt;فقيها و صوفيا فكن ليس واحدا فإني و حق الله إياك فانصح
 فذالك قاس لم يذق قلبه تقي و هذا جهول كيف ذو الجهل يصلح 


&gt; “Faqih and Sufi – be neither one nor the other
&gt; So I with the right of Allah to you give this advice

&gt; That one (the faqih) is harsh, his heart did not taste taqwa
&gt; And this (the sufi) is an ignorant, how can a person of ignorance reform”

This does not mean that Salafis have no Tazkiyyah (self purification), and Sufis have no knowledge of Fiqh (law) it just points out generalities, and focus, and you should try to aim the middle path where you learn from both. 

If anyone tells you ''Don't learn under that person'' - then stay away from the person that tells you this. Any 'Aalim will recommend you to study under many different teachers so you can get the best grasp you can get of the religion. You'll find yourself gravitating towards good Insha'Allah.

Abu Eesa Niamatullah, a teacher of Islamic Fiqh, does a weekly Jurisprudential class both @ The mosque and online - it's only 1 hr per week on wednesdays. It's on propheticguidance.co.uk so sign up there. We learn from the explanations of Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen (who is considered Salafi) and honestly it's a great class.

Further, read some books on purification and cleansing the heart and this and that by e.g reading Hamza Yusuf, or watching some lectures by Dr. Timothy Winter, or just going to a local mosque. 

Always be wary of what you hear, no matter who you hear it from. The more you learn the more you'll understand Islam is very open to ikhtilaaf and differences of opinions that lie within the laws of Islam. And there are many different opinions on things.

Point to note, when I said learn under different teachers, I meant teachers that hold Islamic aqeedah, don't go study under Ismailis or The Nation of 5 Percenters, or Ahmadiyyas - since theirs is an entirely different religion and no longer Islam lol. I meant to study orthodox Islam from various perspectives, madhahibs, tariqahs, etc. 

Personally as someone from Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah I'd stick to Al Maghrib, Bayyinah, Al Qalam etc. They study pretty orthodox Islam that isn't too much leaning to one side or the other. (Not too sufi nor salafi,)",2016-01-20 22:40:58+00:00,cz5s4cy,1.0,t3_41w291,9726.0,islam

2) If your name is not a bad name, then you can keep it. If it's a bad name, then remove it. Bad name example: Abdul Shams (Slave of the Sun) Good name: Dave. John. Bob. Whatever, so long as it isn't a bad name. You can change it into an Arabic name, or whatever. 

3) 2-3 times a day is not okay. You must always try to do 5 of them. If you really can't (you have work, and your boss doesn't allow it, or your mom will get mad if you start praying like a muslim at home and she'll beat you, or some other REAL difficulty (not stuff like: I was busy talking to a friend) - then in that case ,you can make up the prayer later, and do it later. But it'll be a sin to miss the prayer, so you should try to do them within their times. But if you can't, you still have to make up the prayer later. But it's ok, everyone starts out only praying once a day, or twice a day, and slowly they learn to do 5x. But 5x is obligatory, so yes, we must do it. I still miss my prayers once in a while, so don't be too hard on yourself.

4) If they force you, reject it in your heart, and do not believe in it. If you think your life will be in danger, do the above. If they'll let you off for not worshipping, then just say something like you're sick, or you're really busy at that moment. 

5) We love converts. :)

6) You just have to say the Shahada. Shazaib48 posted a video on it. Try to visit a local mosque and ask for some help.

__________________________

For the 4 Imaams (and Shaykh Abu Eesa *(my teacher)*): All prayers missed in ones life have to made up. F

For Ibn Taymiyyah (minority opinion): No you do not need to make up. You make it up tawbah + nafl/sunnah prayers + being consistent in what you say. 

On the day of Judgement if your vat of fardh prayers is insufficient, the angels will take from the vat/barrel of sunnah/nafl prayers and add to it to perfect it to make it sufficient. And if your zakah is insufficient, they will give from sadaqah And if your fast was insufficient, they'll take from muharram, and Monday and Thursday, and ashoora and Sha'ban etc. etc. That's why it is all recommended, to perfect what was mistakes &amp; faults in the dunya.

1361,"&gt; Timeless: not affected by the passage of time or changes in fashion.

The Qur'an is eternal, it does not change with time. Its rulings might apply or not apply at different times (within the area of the Shar'iah of course, we can't change it willy nilly based on our desires, there has to be a good reason for why something will or will not apply). But every ruling is according to its context. If we start applying the Qur'an without knowledge without context, you see the rise of these Daesh groups and other extremist groups that hold no understanding of what the Qur'an is, how it was brought, what it teaches us, what its objectives are, and how God provides hidayah.

Example: When the famine struck, Umar ibn al Khattab lifted the punishment of stealing (cutting off the hand) for reasons that are obvious. People are naturally more prone to steal when they are starving, and the ruling of stealing isn't supposed to be applied to those who are poor and famished. The objective of the Shari'ah is not to punish if the punishment can be averted. 

There is a authentic hadith where the Prophet SAW specifically says to keep the punishment away from the Muslims. 

Likewise, why would you make Tayammum (dry ablution for prayers) if there is running water present? And likewise why would you need 2 women if 1 is sufficient?",2015-12-27 13:44:39+00:00,cycplt1,3.0,t1_cycp2gg,2151.0,islam
1362,"The Quran is meant to help the people at that time, and the people that came afterwards. Naturally you will find t addresses those people as well as our people. The Quran says to not raise our voice over the Prophet's SAW, and to not marry his wives after he passes away. These were contemporary rulings.

The Quran is timeless, from the time it was sent till the day of qiyamah. 

One f the hardest things to do in fiqh (jurisprudence) is to say you know the reason why Allah SWT said x, because it is a claim to divine knowledge. Weed is not haram, but because Allah has told us alcohol is forbidden *because* it is an intoxicant, then everything that intoxicated is haram aswell aka weed, opiates etc.

Likewise, if Allah SWT says it is so the other woman may remind her, but nowadays she doesn't need the reminder (or perhaps she does, in less educated areas of the world) then one woman will suffice. And indeed the Qadhi (Islamic judge) can accept the testimony of one woman in such a case, rather than two.

I don't know why Muslims have this bend over backwards attitude lol, it's not like I asked something offensive of him.

These are the saddest of times.

You are choosing between two forms of happyness. And you are choosing between two forms of sadness. Because regardless of what you do, you will be happy, and you will be sad. You will either be happy with him for some time, and grief at your loss of your love for Allah SWT, and faking in front of your parents your religion, and raising your kids on a path that will only doom them, when it was a gift that was gifted upon you through your parents by Allah - this is not even mentioning the akhirah of yourself! Or you will grief temporarily about him, but in the end you will find yourself succesful in raising children you love and approve of in their religion, and in their character. And yor family will love them and Allah will love them. And so you bestow upon them the gift that your parents gave you, the gift of Islam. And on yawm al qiyamah you can say Allah, despite the fact how much it hurt you, you separated with someone for whom's sake? Not your parents, not your friends, no one but Allah - and he is the only one whom you seek your reward and happiness from.

1447,"He sounds crazy. Alhamdulillah that you lost him. 

Don't fall into the pit of marrying a non-muslim. This was a crazy guy that just acted pious and I promise you there are a ton of brothers out there that will insha'Allah be good to you. And no, you're not damaged goods. Honestly, I'm very strict in regards to issues of zina &amp; all that, the fact this man abused you is a *very* different thing to you willingly entering into haraam relationships. So understand that your *value* has not decreased, not in front of the majority of men, and most importantly, not in front of Allah. 

Next time you meet someone, I recommend getting like a view from the family perspective. Ask him if you're allowed to talk to their mother, or to their sister, and ask THEM what they think of their brother. Or a friend. And to be honest, because it's a person you want to try to spend the rest of your life with insha'Allah.

Again I promise you that this was just a crazy man, and that insha'Allah you will find a righteous husband. Assess their character well, and don't let yourself be abused. Remember that the most hated halal act in front of Allah is divorce, but that does **not** mean it is haraam to divorce.

1452,"One of the Girls that married the prophet saw had been married already 3x by the time she was 14. Who was she? Safiyyah.

Chill out. Just because it was acceptable back then doesn't make it acceptable now. Life circumstances were different people were different. My mother married at 14. I know someone else who's mother got married at 12. And one of my teachers at the mosque had his mother marry at 10. 

Do we think that's acceptable nowadays? No. But living circumstances are different. No scholar in this day and age approves of such marriages. But that doesn't mean they disapprove of Aishas marriage to the prophet saw. In fact, Aisha is your mother, one of the greatest women to have ever existed, she loved the prophet saw. You might think of her as a child, but the Sahaba saw that 9 year old up to the day she died ( many decades later) as their mother, the wife of the Beloved prophet saw, a scholar of Islam, one of the most intimate people in regards to the knowledge of the religion. She was blessed with photographic memory and she was the woman the women of the ansaar in medina would come to to ask for help. In fact before the prophet saw was going to marry her Aisha was already engaged. What does this tell you about the acceptability of marrying at the time? And when people had questions who would they come to? Aisha. What about the other wives? The other wives were jealous of Aisha RA at occasions (and Aisha was jealous of Khadija). Once one of the sahabis came I think t was Amr ibn Al Aas and he asked the prophet who do you love the most out of the people. What did the prophet saw say in front of this commander? ""Aisha"". He said and out of the men? ""Her father"". 

A ton of things we know about our religion is because of Aisha. She is a blessing to this ummah. May you learn to change your views. Everyone thinks of t as disgusting in today's context and rightly so, But 50 years ago life was different, let stand 1400 years ago.",2015-11-20 01:11:01+00:00,cx6e55f,1.0,t3_3t94ub,161372.0,Hijabis
1453,"Hey bro, I recently moved to Uni. 

You are free to practice Islam here. I say take your Shahada and then just learn, and practise some parts of Islam, and not others, until you are free to do as you wish. If you can't pray with locked doors, then don't pray, or pray at different places, on a street corner, or just at home, wherever. I don't know where in the UK you're from but if you're anywhere in Newcastle or Manchester, let me know. :)

As for the love of other things, that changes with time. And some things will never change, and some will change immediately. That's just life, what I can recommend is that despite all of it, you should *try* to reduce it. So even if you can't stop hanging out with female muslim friends, try to reduce interactions that are unnecessary. And if you can't stop listening to Electronic music, try to reduce listening to it. Even if it's 5 minutes less than what you did yesterday. 

I've played games for my entire life, and since I've moved to Uni past september I haven't touched a console or computer game.

The truth is, Islam does acknowledge the existence of gay people but in a ''don't ask, don't tell thing'' because homosexual sex is forbidden within Islamic law. But so long as you don't air you're gay, nobody will care. This might seem negative, but trust me, it's not like there's homosexual police walking around testing the waters - spying is forbidden in Islam.

Access to abortion should stay relatively the same. Islam generally prefers to not abort unless there is good reasoning for aborting (this is different from case to case, the couple has enough children, doesn't want anymore, or the mother's life is in danger) Generally it's allowed before 120 days after the pregnancy (after 3 months) but after that you're going to need to provide a reason for why you're doing it. Society shouldn't become a ''oops we got pregnant, lets just get rid of it'' thing - it should be thought over.

The Prophet Muhammad himself SAW said that ''Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.”

If you want to learn about Islam, learn from the Muslims, not from others. Yeah we're biased cause we're Muslims. But anyone who talks about ''taqiyyah'' and ''stealth jihad'' and all of this nonsense has absolutely no idea what they're talking about. We don't lie about our Prophet SAW.

We're never allowed to terrorise people. Do you think anyone, except a barbarian, would join a religion wherein the goal is to make people feel scared or feel attacked? As for concessions, you're acting like this something that is unreasonable. Indeed, if any group is reaches a sizeable minority, in a democracy they must be given their rights. And indeed, even if they're in a minority if they were in an actual Islamic country (not speaking about the piece of filth that is Daesh). Umar RA was reported to have said that if a Dog dies in thirst in Sham (Syria &amp; Levant region) then he sitting in Medina will be questioned about it on the day of judgement. Everyone is supposed to get their rights fulfilled, indeed to not have their rights fulfilled is a disgrace upon whomever is leading the country. Don't act like ''asking for a concession'' is an unreasonable thing. Everyone should have their rights fulfilled, whether they're MUslim or non muslim.

A lot of the people we take as Sahabis, the Shi'a would not accept or would call him a liar e.g Abu Hurayra. They take their ahadith not from companions per se but from the Ahlul Bayt through the lineage of Ali --&gt; Hassan &amp; Hussain --&gt; Ali Zayn ul Abideen --&gt; Rest of their imams. 

We say that is fine, but we need Isnaad, and character assessment etc for ahadith - but they generally do it through ahlul bayt - hence why you will find us at our roots very similar (nobody cares nowadays whether Ali or Abu Bakr got the khalifa) but what is important in how this all lead up to the fights after the death of the Prophet SAW where even some sahabis were fighting *against* each other due to the different political affiliations they had. 

And STILL this is not why we practise our religion different - our religious differences in practise come from the fact that they take their ahadith from ahlul bayt, and we generally take from all sahabis (as well as ahlul bayt) and so our practises are different here and there.

I recommend you watch Dr Yasir Qadhi's lecture on the Massacre of Karbala (from a Sunni perspective). And that you read the above book on the biography of Abu Bakr RA as well as Ali RA. He will provide insha'Allah good arguments for why one side believes what, why the other believes something else, and what argument is more logical would be apparent.

I just came back from the uni library (10PM) and our flat (particularly our apartment) is the loudest one w/ the DJ's and this and that lol. Trust me there's a lot of fitna. 

Is it good? On the one hand, whenever I speak with my mother we talk about good things, we no longer argue. We used to argue a lot when we lived together. ''Wastetoomuchtime, why don't you do this, why do you do this'' and so on and so forth. But I cannot tell you how much I miss her. We are 4 hours apart from each other since my Uni is in a whole other town. And my father passed away 10.5 years ago so she's very alone - which makes me sadder. All my brothers &amp; sisters have moved out (alhamdulillah they only live 5 mins from her, but they're all married &amp; have lives of their own).

I console her sadness by saying this is life, and reminding her that none of us shall forever enjoy eachother's company. And I console myself by reminding myself of Allah. And thinking of getting married by like next year lol - the fitna is way too much and forgive me for being hasty but I don't have the patience like some brothers to wait till I'm 26 or so to get married.

and for number 7: The Qur'an is the scripture. The Sunnah is the teachings of our prophet SAW which have been codified into a scripture that is judged on a case by case narration called Hadith.

Our creed is essentially There is no God, except God, and Muhammad is his final Messenger. 

But there is more of course. We are obligated to pray the Salah (ritual prayers) to pay the zakah (charity 2.5%),, to fast in Ramadan in the month of ramadan and to make the pilgrimage to the Hajj.

As for the shahada - it is importnat because it is a personal acknowledgement and testitifaction (shahada means to  testify) to the fact that there is none worthy of Worship, except Allah (e.g nothing is worth our time essentially besides God) and Muhammad is his final messenger, to whom we go to to learn about how we should approach God in our dealings and our every day matters.

1548," Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

&gt; In fact it may be said that Paradise is not merely a name for trees, fruits, food, drink, al-hoor al-‘iyn, rivers and palaces. Most people are mistaken concerning that which is called Paradise. Rather Paradise is the name for an abode of absolute and perfect delight, and one of the greatest joys of Paradise is that of gazing upon the Countenance of Allah and hearing His words, and the delight of being close to him and attaining His pleasure. There is no comparison between what it contains of delightful food, drink, clothing and images and this sublime joy. The least of His good pleasure is greater than Paradise and all that it contains of such things, as Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “But the greatest bliss is the Good Pleasure of Allah” [at-Tawbah 9:72].

1554,"&gt; So, God told Muhammad to ask for forgiveness for sins he didn't commit?

God didn't ask the Prophet SAW to do anything (Except what is in the Qur'an) - the Prophet SAW did it himself by his own nature.

&gt; What is forgiveness then?

Forgiveness has more than one meaning, yours is correct, and mine is correct - I'm only clarifying to you why the Prophet Muhammad SAW made dhikr by istighfar (asking Allah for forgiveness) when he was sinless, which I just explained.

&gt; ""Abu Ayyub Ansari reported that Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If you were not to commit sins, Allah would have swept you out of existence and would have replaced you by another people who have committed sin, and then asked forgiveness from Allah, and He would have granted them pardon.""

Of course, I'm only saying that Prophets are exceptions - they are there to be an example and lead people. We the others still have to ask for forgiveness.

The Prophet Muhammad SAW promised Jannah to 10 people. Using your rationale, they might as well have leaned backwards and done nothing for the rest of their life since they were guaranteed Paradise anyway - but that is not how life works.

So feel free to join, bros and sisters, there's always a Q&amp;A section, we go through the book Sharh al Mumti by Ibn Uthaymeen (AKA the explanation+clarification/refutation/acceptance of The Mumti written by Ibn Qudamah, a very great Hanbali scholar).

Trust me, 1 hour a week for maybe a few months is nothing for something that we will be doing until the day we die (Salah!). 

The Ustadh is very good in his explanations, there are usually a small 5-10 min window for Q&amp;A at end to clarify anything that or ask any additional questions, once in a while he side tracks and tells some random story in relation to the fiqh lol, but alhamdulillah he is a very good teacher, thinks very logically and the class will teach you a basic understanding of how Fiqh is taught. (Obviously this is not formal formal, but it is 'formal' aka, have a notebook, make notes on lessons etc. You will be tested at the end of the year.)

Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “When Allah decreed the creation, he wrote in his Book with him on his Throne: My mercy prevails over my wrath.”

The Prophet (sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam) said: “Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He, says, ‘O son of Adam, as long as you call on Me, I shall forgive you of what you have done, and think nothing of it. O son of Adam, even if your sins were to reach up to the clouds in the sky, and then you were to ask for My forgiveness, I would forgive you and think nothing of it. O son of Adam, even if you were to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth, and then you were to meet Me after death, not worshipping anything besides Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as the earth.’” [Tirmidhi]


Allah, the Almighty, says, 'Whosoever does a good deed, will have a reward 10 times like it and I add more, and whosoever does an evil, will have the punishment like it or I will forgive him, and whosoever approaches Me by one span, I will approach him by one cubit, and whosoever approaches Me by one cubit, I approach him by one fathom, and whosoever comes to Me walking, I go to him running, and whosoever meets Me with an earth-load of sins without associating anything with Me, I meet him with forgiveness like that.' (Muslim)

""Allah has divided mercy into 100 parts, and He retained with Him 99 parts, and sent down to earth 1 part. Through this one part creatures deal with one another with compassion, so much so that an animal lifts its hoof over its young lest it should hurt it."" (Al-Bukhari)

1679,"''Governing a state has nothing to do with religion'' I think it's you that's supposed to read ''a book or three'' if you think that a state has absolutely nothing to do with religion. 

Ahadith and Qur'an are the guiding principles by which we live our lives - they are not mutually exclusive from an education. It is perfectly possible to be a hafidh of the Qur'an, a master of ahadith and Fiqh, and at the same time have an education. Mufti Hussain Kamaani has a MBA in Business and also has an Ijaza from scholars to teach Fiqh. Shaykh Hussain Satar has a degree in Medicine from the University of Chicago and is also an Alim in the religion. You're bringing nonsense excuses. 

&gt; imagine if our leaders had degrees and masters in Economics, Law, the Sciences, Politics or History instead of tasbeh in their hand.

How ignorant are you? Do you ever even watch Afghan TV? They're arguing in the parliament about nonsense issues while they have barely even studied their religion - they don't walk around with a tasbih in their hand. You know who was walking around with a Tasbih in his hand? Bayaat when he was handing out rice and food to the poor to help them in their time of need. You know what the people in parliament are doing? Earning cash in $ format while doing nothing to better the situation of the country. If any of them had even grown up in a masjid or learnt about their religion, we wouldn't have random people around the country doing 15 to 20 years in Kabul Prison for committing Zina. What kind of reasoning is that? It is not from the Qur'an and Sunnah. I remember the Prophet SAW turning someone away when they wanted to confess to having committing Zina, not locking them up for 15 years. 

&gt; Instead they have knowledge of how to suck up to Arabs and Iranians and Americans

Bla bla bla, why don't you blame the Zionists as well. It's called diplomacy. The ones in Parliament are the ones walking around with their Economics, Law or Politics degrees. They're not walking around with Tasbihs in parliament. If they had knowledge of the inner, and the outer, both religion and secular knowledge, Afghanistan could be a thriving point of Central Asia. Stop blaming others. The Mullahs need secular knowledge and the people in Parliament need religious knowledge. 

Countries like Malaysia, Singapore etc are doing just fine while still being leading nations Islamically. But most Afghans don't look east on the map away from Afghanistan. Glorious 'west' innit m8. If we want an Islamic republic, it definitely can get better than this, stop giving up so easily. This is exactly why Afghanistan is failing as a country, it has an extremely defeatist attitude in regards to anything where they have to put in even remote effort to be honest, upright, or hardworking. And it's hard, I get that. But if you don't try, you're not gonna get anything at all.. Yeah we've been dealt a shitty hand, but the reality is that most are unwilling to play the hand anyway - and they'd rather fold. 

I recommend you read some books. 

Read about the life of Malcolm X - what is racism and how does it hold society back? Why do people cheat? How can you be both a Muslim and successful?

Read the seerah of the Prophet SAW - who is it that we follow? Why is it this man we follow?

Read the Qur'an with a teacher. Have you opened it once after Ramadan? This book was revealed over 23 years - you do not learn it within a day.

While you're at it, go do a degree in something and discipline yourself and stop this shitty defeatist attitude. I dream of a better Afghanistan insha'Allah in the future. If you think this is the best Islamic republic we can get, then you've failed your country. But I will not fail mine. Khuda hafez. ",2015-08-22 23:15:51+00:00,cuc9dq8,3.0,t1_cuc7iec,3649.0,Afghan

Abu Ubaida said, “O commander of the faithful, are you doing this? You have taken off your sandals and placed them on your back and you led the camel through the creek yourself. I do not think it will be easy for me to get the people of this country to honor you.” Umar said, “If only someone else had said this, O Abu Ubaida! I have made this a deterrent for the nation of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Verily, we were a disgraceful people and Allah honored us with Islam, so if we seek honor from other than Islam, then Allah will humiliate us.”

1699,"&gt; Islam isn't a thing you dislike out of ignorance. The more you know about it, the more detestable it becomes. In fact, when I knew nothing of Islam I was quite fond of it, not the other way around.

For most of us, it's the other way around alhamdulillah.

&gt; I think any god that would respect someone for believing in Islam despite the lack of evidence is a god that I don't respect.

There is evidence. He is already quite disrespectful by thinking that a God's opinion is much less important than his opinion RE: ''I think''

&gt; Especially considering the hateful and damaging way Islam treats women, gays, 'non-believers' and animals.

This person knows absolutely zilch about Islam.

&gt; ''You're wrong anyway''

He's quoting ISIS HAHAHAHAHA instead of just you know looking at Islamic history or how the Prophet Muhammad SAW was or how  the khilafa rashidun were or how the Scholars acted or quoting Surah al Kafirun.

&gt; Bullshit. You need to educate yourself so you can stop embarrassing yourself. I'm actually very embarrassed for Islamic people, they look so foolish.


Please don't waste your time with this idiot, he calls us Islamic people, not even knowing the distinction that Islamic is used to describe concepts, Muslims are followers of Islam. I doubt he's ever met a Muslim. 

&gt; Why does our religion prescribe us to stone homosexuals, simply because they are gay? Because someone is gay, we must kill them?

Our religion does not prescribe us to stone homosexuals simply because they are gay. Homosexuals, like us heterosexuals, are people with feelings. And sometimes those feelings take control of them, may Allah protect them and help them away from it. THe reality is that sodomy is not allowed in our religion. But we aren't allowed to go run willy nilly stoning people. The shari'ah makes the rules as such, such that the situation for finding someone engaging in homosexual intercourse is nearly impossible. It does not punish private acts either, and spying on people is forbidden.

Why is it forbidden? Why is pork forbidden? Why is anything at all forbidden? The reality of the situation is that sometimes things are forbidden not due to the thing itself being necessarily filthy (though it might be and often is) but more to assess the willingness of the servant to abide by his Lord's wills. Your mother takes you to Disneyland. You enjoy your day, go home, sleep. Next morning she tells you you're going to some wildlife park, would you trust her that she knows how to get there? You trusted her on the disney land ride. Islam brings you many things, some which might seem logical, some which might not. But we can't reject what is logical and what is not, simply based on our own (faulty reasoning) - if we believe that the source material is true (e.g the Qur'an &amp; Sunnah) - then whatever that derives from the Qur'an and Sunnah is true, regardless of our reasoning. The only thing that can be different is our understanding of it (e.g how to apply it).

1722,"1. Iran is seen as one of the more ''liberal'' countries by mere fact that it is not Arab (for some reason Western people think Afghans are Arab, only because some Afghans are conservative?). If Iran is more ''liberal'' but it is being oppressed - but hey, look, the people are white like us! - then we must go free them! 

2. Eastern women are seen to be 'exotic' and 'wild' - and since most Iranian people tend to have a more lighter complexion in comparison to other races in central Asia (Oriental asians are too ''asian'' if you get what I mean, and Arabs are too brown) -, then the west tends to also be more attracted to them (simply by mere biology) - AKA maybe one of them will sleep with me if I save her from that terrible Islamic regime over there. The Iranian women is white like the western one, but too different to be counted as white. In that regard, they are quite like Russian women (e.g familial &amp; conservative upbringing, liberal whitestyle, different enough to be non white and 'distinct') 

3. Iranian men aren't as appreciated because today's world is a man's world, and a man's world revolves around women (due to sexuality). And lets be frank here, a woman's world (due to the rise of Western feminism) also revolves around a woman's world.

Where is the man's role in this? He is slowly losing his role. If he asserts himself, he is a bigot. And if he conforms, beghayrat ast. If he is there for his children, he is praised as being one of few fathers that were there for his children and loved his children, what lowly praise is that? This should tell you enough about the status of men in western society.

You get to know who God is in chapter 55, 59, learn about the afterlife in 67, in 72 you learn about Jinn, the rest few surahs become extremely poetical with their descriptions of the heavens, 89 is one of my favourites in particular. 97 is about laylat ul qadr, and 99 about justice and the day of judgement. These are all very short chapters, very poetic in nature and require very little contest. We have scholars that can speak for hours about chapter 105, 108 or 110 even though these are among the shortest chapters of the Quran (that is to say - they do have context!). 109, 112,113,114 are the 4 so called 'qul's.

You have come to your people with an important matter, dividing the community thereby and ridiculing their customs, and you have insulted their gods and their religion, and declared that their forefathers were unbelievers, so listen to me and I will make some suggestions, and perhaps you will be able to accept one of them.' The apostle agreed, and he went on, 'If what you want is money, we will gather for you out of our property so that you may be the richest of us; if you want honour, we will make you our chief so that no one can decide anything apart from you; if you want sovereignty, we will make you king, and if this ghost which comes to you, which you see, is such that you cannot get rid of him, we will find a physician for you, and exhaust our means in getting you cured of it', or words to that effect. The apostle listened patiently, and then said: 'Now listen to me, In the Name of God, the compassionate and merciful, H.M., a revelation from the compassionate, the merciful, a book whose verses are expounded as an Arabic Quran for a people who understand, as an announcement and warning, though most of them turn aside not listening and say, “Our hearts are veiled from that to which you invite us.'''' Then the apostle continued to recite it to him. When Utba heard it from him, he listened attentively, putting his hands behind his back and leaning on them as he listened. Then the prophet ended at the prostration and prostrated himself, and said, 'You have heard what you have heard, Abu Al Walid; the rest remains with you.' When Utba returned to his companions they noticed that his expression had completely altered, and they asked him what happened. He said that he had heard words such as he had never heard before, which were neither poetry, spells, nor witchcraft. 'Take my advice and do as I do, leave this man entirely alone for, by God, the words which I have heard will be blazed abroad. If (other) Arabs kill him, others will have rid you of him; if he gets the better of the Arabs, his sovereignty will be your sovereignty, his power your power, and you will be prosperous through him.' They said, 'He has bewitched you with his tongue.' To which he answered, 'You have my opinion, you must do what you think fit.'

1847,"&gt; 45 It is evident from many authentic Traditions that the Prophet himself
intensely detested
 the idea of beating one's wife, and said on more than one occasion,
""Could any of you beat his
 wife as he would beat a slave, and then lie with her in the evening?""
(Bukhari and Muslim).
 According to another Tradition, he forbade the beating of any woman with
the words, ""Never
 beat God's handmaidens"" (Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
Ibn Hibban and
 Hakim, on the authority of Iyas ibn 'Abd Allah; Ibn Hibban, on the
authority of 'Abd Allah
 ibn 'Abbas; and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Umm Kulthum). When the above
Qur'an-verse
 authorizing the beating of a refractory wife was revealed, the Prophet is
reported to have
 said: ""I wanted one thing, but God has willed another thing - and what
God has willed must
 be best"" (see Manar V, 74). With all this, he stipulated in his sermon on
the occasion of
 the Farewell Pilgrimage, shortly before his death, that beating should be
resorted to only
 if the wife ""has become guilty, in an obvious manner, of immoral
conduct"", and that it should
 be done ""in such a way as not to cause pain (ghayr mubarrih)""; authentic
Traditions to this
 effect are found in Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. On
the basis of these
 Traditions, all the authorities stress that this ""beating"", if resorted
to at all, should
 be more or less symbolic - ""with a toothbrush, or some such thing""
(Tabari, quoting the
 views of scholars of the earliest times), or even ""with a folded
handkerchief"" (Razi); and
 some of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the
opinion that it is just
 barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify
this opinion by the
 Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem.

He is Allah , other than whom there is no deity, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed. He is the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. He is Allah , other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him. He is Allah , the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner; to Him belong the best names. Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. &lt; last 3 ayaat of Surah Hashr.

Can you conceive that which you cannot fathom? I can't imagine what is inside this universe, let stand what is outside it. God is the thing from which we all originate, he is our creator. Can you think or imagine something which you've never thought of before? I think that's why there's an innate desire within us all to meet God, because it answers our deepest inner question of not only who we are, but also who God is, and what is this ''matter'' around us. What is life?

One night I missed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) from his bed. I searched for him. When I found him he was in bowing or prostrating posture and was reciting: Subhanaka wa bi hamdika. La ilaha illa Anta (You are free from imperfection and I begin praising You. There is no true god except You).""

Another narration is: My hand fell over his feet while he was in prostration with his feet erect. He was supplicating: ""**Allahumma inni a'udhu biridaka min sakhatika, wa bi-mu'afatika min 'uqubatika, wa a'udhu bika minka, la uhsi thana'an 'alaika, Anta kama athnaita 'ala Nafsika** (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath and in Your forgiveness from Your punishment. And I seek refuge in You from You; I cannot praise You enough; You are as You have praised Yourself).""

Uhh yeah, there are things that can make you a not muslim. Sticking to our religion's loving principles does not mean we dismiss the religious principles that actually make us Muslim. If you don't believe in the entirety of the Qur'an, you're not Muslim, no Muslim is going to pretend you're ''brothers'' if someone rejects parts of the Qur'an.

For the record, Shias are mostly cool, just like Sunnis. 

&gt; We're an ummah, we shouldn't care how someone else views things as

We should. What if that other person believes Eesa AS was crucified? Or that the Prophet Muhammad SAW isn't the last prophet? This is absolutely nonsense, we should care. If we become lax in our religion, we will become like some other religious groups where religion is merely a cultural thing, we all differ, it's okay to be ''different''. 

Should we be respectful of each other? Of course. But I'm not going to pretend things are alright when things aren't. However this fake 'unity' where we all differ yet we pretend we are Muslims together is not something to pride ourselves on. This is a religion of truth, and while differences of opinion in terms of Fiqh etc are okay, the religion of God is one. You either adhere to it, or you don't.

2053,"45 It is evident from many authentic Traditions that the Prophet himself
intensely detested
 the idea of beating one's wife, and said on more than one occasion,
""Could any of you beat his
 wife as he would beat a slave, and then lie with her in the evening?""
(Bukhari and Muslim).
 According to another Tradition, he forbade the beating of any woman with
the words, ""Never
 beat God's handmaidens"" (Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
Ibn Hibban and
 Hakim, on the authority of Iyas ibn 'Abd Allah; Ibn Hibban, on the
authority of 'Abd Allah
 ibn 'Abbas; and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Umm Kulthum). When the above
Qur'an-verse
 authorizing the beating of a refractory wife was revealed, the Prophet is
reported to have
 said: ""I wanted one thing, but God has willed another thing - and what
God has willed must
 be best"" (see Manar V, 74). With all this, he stipulated in his sermon on
the occasion of
 the Farewell Pilgrimage, shortly before his death, that beating should be
resorted to only
 if the wife ""has become guilty, in an obvious manner, of immoral
conduct"", and that it should
 be done ""in such a way as not to cause pain (ghayr mubarrih)""; authentic
Traditions to this
 effect are found in Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah. On
the basis of these
 Traditions, all the authorities stress that this ""beating"", if resorted
to at all, should
 be more or less symbolic - ""with a toothbrush, or some such thing""
(Tabari, quoting the
 views of scholars of the earliest times), or even ""with a folded
handkerchief"" (Razi); and
 some of the greatest Muslim scholars (e.g., Ash-Shafi'i) are of the
opinion that it is just
 barely permissible, and should preferably be avoided: and they justify
this opinion by the
 Prophet's personal feelings with regard to this problem.

2072,We certainly are a deen of tradition. People have had sawm times of 18+ hrs since the muslims arrived in Western Europe. Nothing's changed except people's willingness to fast 18 hrs. 18 hrs is nothing when most people go starving every day. I haven't met anyone who couldn't do it. Is it tough? Yes. But A lot of things in life are. And it's nothing you can't endure. ,2015-06-18 17:12:57+00:00,csaw1ay,5.0,t1_csaui5l,2200.0,islam
