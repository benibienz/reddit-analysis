The Gravity of Issuing Fatāwā




**Introduction**

We are living in a time when many unqualified individuals tend to express their views on Islām. And likewise, those people who have not studied the rulings of Islām, its jurisprudence, theology and all its various sciences have a tendency of speaking on these grave subjects based on their opinions driven by desires.

The task of issuing Fatāwā is one which cannot be handled by someone who has not studied the various Islāmic sciences, especially that of issuing legal, juristic rulings. Shaykh Ṣalāḥ Abu l-Ḥājj writes in his Muqaddimah of Is‘ād al-Muftī [1] that many institutes are negligent toward teaching the science of answering legal rulings.

If our Dars-e-Niẓāmī Madāris are examined, one will notice that a special course has been constructed to be taught after the ‘ālimiyyah course known as Takhaṣṣuṣ fi l-Iftā’ wherein students are taught how to deal with contemporary Masā’il and equally, how to answer Fatāwā. If a person has not studied this science under a competent Muftī, he is unqualified to issue legal rulings. The reason for this is that he will be unable to reconcile between the evidences and various Riwāyāt of the Madhhab leaving the laymen confused.

It has been observed that too many graduates love diving into answering Fatāwā without understanding the seriousness of this action. It is then that we find ‘Ulamā’ adopting isolated opinions from the scholars of the Madhhab and straying from the Manhaj of Iftā’ (May Allāh protect us). Students as well as graduates who have not studied the field of Rasm al-Muftī must be cautious in their steps. Shaikh ‘Awwāmah states, “The religion of Allāh is above being left as a plaything in the hands of the jesters simply because the unqualified claim to practice the Sunnah. Every field has its experts and a person should not transgress his limits.” [2]

After understanding that not every person is actually qualified to issue Fatāwā, it is also important to know how serious it is to issue a Fatwā without knowledge. Thereafter, we will look at the attitude of our pious predecessors in issuing Fatāwā and how cautious they were. 

**The Gravity of Issuing Fatāwā and Being Bold therein**

When a Muftī issues a Fatwā, he is in effect speaking on behalf of Allāh. It is as if he is saying that Allāh has disapproved of this and approved of that. It is extremely crucial for the one giving a Fatwā that he seeks the Haqq and avoids issuing rulings according to the interest of the people which may appeal to one’s Nafs.

Rasūlullāh (Ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has said: “Whosoever was issued a Fatwā which was not substantiated correctly, then the burden of sin will be upon the one who issued the Fatwā.” [3]

In another narration, Rasūlullāh (Ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is reported to have said: “Verily Allāh will not take away knowledge all at once. Rather, He will take it away by the death of Scholars, until no (true) Scholar will remain and then the masses will make ignorant people their leaders. They will be deviated and will also deviate others.” [4]

Shaykh ‘Atiyyah Ṣaqr: “The one who is unaware of a particular ruling should consult the specialists (of that field). And whosoever issues a ruling without the correct knowledge has lied upon Allāh and His Messenger (Ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam), hence he is deviated from the straight path and he will deviate others. Thus, it is not permissible for the one who does not have sufficient knowledge to issue a Fatwā. Rasūlullah (Ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked about:

al-Rūḥ 

The People of al-Kahf 

Dhu l-Qarnayn

He did not answer until Waḥy was revealed in which he was given the answers for the three questions.” [5] 

Al-Barā’ ibn ‘Āzib: “I saw 300 from the people of Badr; every one of them would desire that their companion gives a Fatwā and not them.” [6]

Ibn al-Munkadir: “A Muftī is the joining point between Allāh and His creation, so he should be wary of his steps. It is compulsory for him to remain silent if he fears making an error.” [7]

Sufyān ibn ‘Uyaynah: “I met jurists (Fuqahā’) who disliked issuing Fatāwā until they would consider it necessary. He also said: Those who are the most competent in issuing Fatāwā generally are the most silent in them, and those who are ignorant are the most vocal.” [8]

Imām al-Nawawī: “Know well that the position of Iftā’ is very sensitive. It is a lofty position and holds great virtue because the Muftī is the heir of the Prophets and he is fulfilling a Farḍ al-Kifāyah.” [9]

Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr narrates with his chain of transmission to ‘Uqbah ibn Muslim who said: “I stayed in the company of Ibn ‘Umar (Raḍiyallāhu ‘anhumā) for 34 months. Most of the time when he was asked a (Mas’alah/Fatwā), he would reply, “I don’t know”. He would then turn towards us and ask, “Do you know what these people are trying to do? They wish to make our backs a bridge for them to Jahannam.” [10] 

**The Attitude of Our Salaf**

One of the students of Imām Mālik said: “By Allāh! When Mālik was asked a question, his condition would become such as though he is standing between Jannah and Jahannam.” [11]

Al-Imām al-A‘zam Abū Ḥanīfah: “If I did not fear knowledge being lost, I would not have issued a Fatwā for anyone.”

Abū Ḥafṣ al-Naysābūrī: “An ‘Ālim should be such that when a Mas’alah is posed to him, he fears being questioned on the Day of Qiyāmah: ‘From where did you respond?’” [12]

Ibn Mahdī: “I heard Mālik say: ‘At times when I receive a query, I spend nights awake in trying to solve that query.”

For more quotes on Tahayyub al-Salaf li l-Futyā, see Muftī Taqī ‘Uthmānī’s Uṣūl al-Iftā’ wa Adābuh along with its Sharḥ, al-Fatḥ al-Rabbānī. 

**Important Advice to the Muslim Masses**

In this era of technological advancements, one of the biggest harms the Muslim Ummah has faced is that any incompetent person can use social media and start giving Fatāwā. After reading the above statements, one can easily conclude that issuing a Fatwā is not something to be taken lightly. Moreover, laymen should consult reputable, competent ‘Ulamā’ for their Dīn-related queries and not seek advice from self-proclaimed people of knowledge on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube.

It's a sad reality that individuals who sin openly, disregard the laws of interaction with the opposite gender and even use explicit language, have now become the primary source of seeking knowledge for many. Every person out there with “Abū"" or ""Ibn” attached to their name does not just somehow qualify as a Muftī. These so-called Muftīs who perform their own principle-less ijtihād are in reality leading people away from the pristine teachings of Islam. I will leave you with this profound and extremely relevant statement of Ibn Sīrīn (Raḥmatullāhi ‘alayh): “Verily this knowledge is Dīn, so be careful who you take your Dīn from.”

May Allāh Ta‘ālā protect us from the mischief of the mischievous and keep us steadfast on the straight path. Amīn.

A person told Imām Ahmad, “O Abū Abdullāh, there is no authentic narration in this issue! He (i.e. Imām Ahmad) said, “If there is no authentic narration in this issue, there is still the opinion of Imām al-Shāfi‘ī regarding it and his evidence is most reliable in this.”

Imām Taqī ud Dīn as-Subkī (the father of the famed Tāj ud Dīn)  mentions:

&gt; The duty of the layman is to refer to the statements of the scholars. It is not permissible for a non-mujtahid when he hears a verse of the Qur’ān or a narration that he leaves the statements of the scholars. This is because when he sees them going against it despite having knowledge of it, it is evident that they only went against it because of a proof. Allāh has mentioned, “Ask the people of the Remembrance, if you do not know.”

Sometimes if a major scholar holds an opinion, then their opinion is the evidence, even if we personally (as laymen) do not know their evidence. This does not of course mean we blind follow, but we must give the benefit of the doubt if we recognize in them characteristics of 'Ilm and Taqwā.

And Allāh knows best.

One of the reasons we fast is because Allah has ordained it upon us, because we might attain God consciousness, or fear of God as some translate it - Taqwa. The ability to always remember Him, and be grateful to Him, and to not fall ourselves into such a situation where we forget Him, and because of it he makes us forget ourselves. 

And be not like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient. [59:19]

But this religion is a deen, it is a lifestyle, we don't just randomly worship Allah in whatever way we want - it's prescribed in a certain way by Allah so that we don't deprive ourselves from our Akhirah and so he might show the distinction between true worshippers, and those who did not follow the Shari'ah in their worship, and just did whatever their heart desired. They were not pursuing God according to God's rulings, but rather, they tried pursuing Him according to whatever they thought was right in their mind (and one mind can be such a weak thing).

If you come on /r/Islam to ask a question, then may Allah bless you because He gave you a passionate desire for the deen, such that you are looking for the real answer and hukm on something. Some people say ignorance is bliss - and you couldn't make a more ignorant statement (Islamically speaking). It is obligated upon us to seek knowledge - to the extent that we have the ability to.

But please keep in mind, that you can only take your legal rulings from scholars. /r/Islam does not contain any fuqaha, and there might be some of us who have studied particular parts of the deen, but those will be few. The truth is that you cannot take knowledge from here on the legal rulings within the religion, especially because of the fact that non Muslims get an input here, and they especially are unqualified to give the answer.

We have nothing against Non Muslims, they are from the sons of Adam AS, and they are our brothers in humanity - and we love them for that, but in terms of religion, we cannot take from them. They are free to share their input, etc. etc. debate life and all those things, etc. But I would like to ask, if a Muslim is asking a legal ruling on a particular situation they are in, please refrain from answering out of decency and respect. They're asking for help, and all you're doing is confusing them.

If a Muslim said, ''I reached the Jama'ah prayer and finished my takbeeratul ihraam, and was going down for my ruku as the Imam was standing up saying samiAllahu liman hamida... Do I pray an extra raka'ah or not?'' No Muslim or non Muslim here would dare answer the question unless they had studied Fiqh us Salah. You realize you're not qualified to answer this question, it is far out of your scope. So what is the matter then that you think you get an input on our fasting? Do we look towards lay muslims/non muslims for the rulings of how to do Hajj? Do we look towards lay muslim or non muslims on when the finger is raised during salah? Or how much you pay on your zakah? No.

Please, do not give a legal ruling, unless you are qualified to give the ruling or have heard a Shaykh you know answer that PARTICULAR situation. Allah will hold you accountable for the rulings you give, and even as simple as ''yeah, I think it's fine'' is a legal ruling in Islam.

And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, ""Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?"" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one. [18:49]

As for non muslims, I understand you don't believe in Allah, but then out of respect for our community, refrain from replying to those threads. Understand that you'll only confuse the questioner, they'll think you're Muslim, they'll take your answer, and it's just a whole mess. On the other thread random ex-muslims and non muslims were telling a brother to break his fast for his job. And imagine how grave a sin that is - to speak about that which you don't know about. In law, we call that Fraud. Just because this isn't a Lawyers Office but it's an Islamic forum doesn't make you *morally speaking* any less of a charlatan who comes over as something he's not, who speaks on something he's not qualified to speak on. Feel free to share your insight, comments, etc on other topics. But legalities is not something we, even as muslims, just give whatever answer to unless we're qualified.

Imam ash Shafi'i said ''Whoever learns from books will lose understanding of the rulings.'' [Majmu' of an Nawawi]

Someone told Imam Abu Hanifah, “In the mosque there is a circle (Halaqah) in which the people are looking at fiqh.” He asked, “Do they have a head (i.e. a teacher)?” The man replied, “No.” The Imam said, “These [people] will never gain knowledge of fiqh.”
[Al Faqih wal Mutafaqqih]

Imam Malik was asked, “Can knowledge be taken from a man who has not [to his credit any] seeking [of knowledge] nor sitting [with scholars]?” He (Imam Malik) said, “No.” [Is'af al Mubatta']

“In the early age, knowledge was in the hearts of men, and therafter, it was transcribed onto the skins of animals, but the keys to it remained in the hearts of men.”
[Ibn Rushd, in Muwafaqat by ash Shatibi]

These final athar I'm just quoting that you know that just because you've read a book on something, does not make you qualified to give rulings either. If fasting is to attain god consciousness, then be conscious of God, and know that you are not qualified to give an answer to the brother/sister.

Please, always refer to scholars. If you know no scholars at all and can't ask them, then ask here and maybe someone knows a bit (which they'll be held accountable for, if they answer wrongly). But do not make this your first place to ask.

Any mistake made is mine in having written this, and may Allah forgive me for it. And He knows best. Forgive me if I came over as arrogant, or judgemental. I would hate to see you on the Day of Judgement be held accountable for what your tongue uttered.

The Prophet SAW said whoever safekeeps whats between his two lips &amp; legs, he's promised Jannah. Yet remember that safekeeping your tongue is not only swearing/cursing. It is far greater than that.

We laugh and yet – who knows? – perhaps Allah has looked at some of our works and said: “I will not accept anything from you.” Woe to you, son of Adam! Can you fight Allah? Whoever disobeys Allah is fighting Him. By Allah! I have met seventy veterans of Badr. Most of their garments were wool. Had you seen them you would have said they are crazy, and had they seen the best among you they would have said: “Those people will have no part in the Hereafter.” Had they seen the worst among you they would have said: “Those people do not believe in the Day of Reckoning.” I have seen people for whom this world was cheaper than the dust under their feet. I have seen people the like of whom would come home at night, not finding more than his own portion of food, and yet say: “I shall not put all of this into my belly. I shall certainly give some away for Allah’s sake.” Then he would give away some of his food in charity, even if he were more in need of it than its recipient.

You didn't wanna shake hands? Well. That's what we do here. Nobody forced you to come here - if you don't like it, don't come. When in Rome, do as the Romans,'' yet when we Muslims say if you want to go to Jannah 100%, you must be Muslim and believe in Allah, and the last day, and heaven and hell, and this and that. Then it suddenly becomes ''Oh but I'm a generally good person! God is such a [x] for not allowing me into Heaven just cause I don't believe in him or I don't want to worship him. What is he, a tyrant?! I deserve Heaven.''

And [that] He may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women - those who assume about Allah an assumption of evil nature... **[48:6]** 

They feel as if this is an attack on all of them - when it really isn't. If you wanna become Muslim, just repeat after us: Ash hadu an laa ilaha ilAllah, wa ash hadu anna Muhammad ar RasulAllah. It's statement of fact - not an attack. Just because we don't hold Perennialistic beliefs and we don't believe everyone goes to heaven, doesn't mean we see non-muslims as worthless people. That is insane, we value and love you guys too - that's why we want you to understand and love Islam. Only difference is that our love is different. With you, we share humanly love. Whereas with our brothers &amp; sisters, we share a religiously binding love. It's why we love Palestine despite less than 1% of the Ummah probably being from Palestine. It's why, for example, when we give zakah we give it to only Muslims, because we're religiously bound to them - we owe them. In things like Sadaqah, yes you can give it to anyone, but some portion of our wealth goes to our own aswell. And there is nothing wrong with this. Doesn't the government of a people spend upon its own people first, before it looks towards others? Don't we fix our own homelessness/starvation/whatever problems first, before we look trying to help others in theirs? 

_________

In the end, regardless of whether you like it or not, we exist.

And regardless of whether you like it or not, we will pay in the afterlife. 

The currency is either bad deeds, or it is good deeds - and our intentions &amp; beliefs during the deed is always taken into account.

When the angels in the grave ask us the three questions (Who's your lord, what's your religion, who is your prophet?) we're going to have to answer. 

And you *choose* what you will answer to that. 

And you can choose now.. Or Postpone. But in the end, we all will meet our end one day, and who knows what belief we will die upon? May Allah SWT make it one which is pleasing to Him and allows it to be our entry into the abode of the akhirah. 

The bedouins say, ""We have believed."" Say, ""You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds of anything. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" **[49:14]**

Abu Sa’eed reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Death will be brought on the Day of Resurrection in the form of a white ram, and it will be made to stand between Paradise and Hellfire. It will be said to the people of Paradise: Do you recognize this? They will raise their heads looking towards it and they will say: Yes, it is death. Then it will be said to the people of Hellfire: Do you recognize this? They will raise their heads looking towards it and they will say: Yes, it is death. Then the command will be given to slaughter the ram and it will be said: O people of Paradise, there is everlasting life for you and no death! And it will be said: O people of Hellfire, there is everlasting life for you and no death!” Then the Messenger of Allah recited the verse, “Warn them of this day of dismay, when their affairs will be decided, yet they are heedless and they do not believe.” (19:39) and he pointed with his hand to the world.

More recently, however, I reflected on the many Salafi friends and associates I have and the amazing work they are doing to serve Islam. Far from being narrow-minded, bigoted hotheads, they are honorable, fair-minded, balanced men and women whose love for Allah, the Messenger (peace and blessings upon him) and Islam itself is almost unparalleled. At a time when so many forces are trying to divide Muslims and get us to fight one another, I could see no way that I could remain silent and not add my voice to the desperately needed calls for unity and mutual appreciation and respect.

Do Not Blame the Salafis

The current avalanche of negativity directed at Islam and Muslims, fueled, to a large extent, by the actions of coldblooded “Jihadi” murderers, and increasingly stoked by the mainstream news media, is unsettling to most people, including most Muslims. That being the case, there is a desperate search for answers and solutions. One result of that desperation is the tendency to discard nuance and history when analyzing the roots of ""Jihadi"" violence.

Nowhere is this clearer than in the argument being advanced by some that the maniacal violence of the likes of Boko Haram and ISIS is due to their Salafist roots. While this argument is convenient and simple, it is not an accurate or detailed explanation for such violence. Utilizing it disguises some very important facts and opens the door to undermining the very critical solidarity needed by those in the Muslim community, many of whom call themselves Salafis, who stand in vehement opposition to ISIS, Boko Haram, Al Qaeda and their ilk.

We begin by mentioning that one of the most influential Salafi scholars of the Twentieth Century, Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, was decidedly apolitical. This is particularly true after his indirect association with the failed Meccan Revolt of 1979. From then on, the focus of his ""Dawah"" was to encourage the adoption of a particular interpretation of the theological and legal methodology of the early generations of Muslims (as-Salaf as-Salih), while purging Islam of what he considered to be unfounded, corrupting accretions. In his view, and that of his followers, victory for Islam and the Muslims, in this world, would only be accomplished when these steps have been taken and would ultimately involve Divine intervention. This is the approach endorsed by the overwhelming majority of Salafis worldwide.

Furthermore, the Salafis have a consistent methodology (Minhaj), as Al-Albani and other Salafis place great emphasis on the foundational aspects of Muslim belief and practice. Legally, some see that methodology as reflecting elements of the literalism of Dawud al-Dhahiri and Ibn Hazm, and to a certain extent, the legal reasoning of the Shafi’i school, from which Dawud al-Dhahiri emerged. Others would say that Salafis are committed to a legal methodology more akin to what is popularly known as comparative fiqh, which focuses on considering the opinions of various juridical schools on a particular issue and then choosing the one deemed to be evidentiary preponderant.

In theology, most Salafis adopt a methodology that generally reflects the positions of the Hanbalis, with special emphasis on the emendations of the great, if controversial, Hanbali scholar, ibn Taymiyya. It is extremely important to note that the Salafi theological approach, while highly critical of the Ash’aris and Maturidis, in the Sunni realm, did not lead to the inability to peacefully and respectfully coexist with other Muslims –with rare exception. This respect is exemplified by ibn Taymiyya in his famous debate with the great Ash’ari, Sufi scholar ibn ‘Ata Allah Sakandari. Unlike the Salafis, ISIS, Boko Haram and their likeness have demonstrated no consistent legal or theological methodology. This allows them to distort the basic texts of Islam in ways that find little historical precedence and even less resonance among contemporary scholars.

Some will readily acknowledge that not all Salafis, such as al-Albani, are violent, but that the violence exhibited by Boko Haram, ISIS, Al Qaeda and similar groups is rooted in Salafi teachings. They would argue, to rephrase a popular Islamophobic cliché, ""Not all Salafis are violent extremists, but all violent extremists are Salafis."" This is simply not true. While the violence of ISIS, Boko Haram and similar groups is well-publicized, the Alawi thugs defending the Asad regime, the Shiites of Hizbollah, who have flooded into Syria, the Iraqi Shiite militias and death squads that helped to push many Iraqi Sunnis into the ranks of ISIS, have all engaged in ghastly acts of violence. None of these latter groups, would be described in any way as Salafis. Hence, alienation, disenfranchisement, rabid sectarianism, a perceived threat to their very existence, or to the existence of an ally, as opposed to Salafism, might be more insightful explanations for the violence of all of these parties and factions.

We add here, for clarity, that of course not all violent extremists are Muslims. This is clearly indicated by the actions of the American military in Iraq and elsewhere, Hindu death squads in India, crimes committed by the Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza, tribal militias in Rwanda and the Congo, Mexican and other Central and South American drug cartels, and many others. Examining this issue in detail is beyond the scope of this essay.

To begin to understand the sources of violence exhibited by “Jihadis,” we need to look beyond simplistic slogans. One of the issues that helps us to understand that violence is Takfir, the act of excommunicating other Muslims and declaring them to be outside the pale of Islam. This dangerous practice allows some Muslims to attack others with wanton impunity. While it is certainly true that some Salafis, currently and historically, may be guilty of Takfir, it is not an exclusive Salafi problem.

Historically, Takfir was the hallmark of the Khawarij. The abuses and excesses of the Khawarij, in terms of their readiness to excommunicate other Muslims, were roundly repudiated by the historical antecedents of present-day Salafis and are rejected by most Salafis today. Many Muslims today view groups like ISIS as the modern-day Khawarij. That being the case, what do we say about those Salafis who condemn both the Khawarij as well as ISIS and reject their violence and the doctrines that enable it?

In more recent times, some of the groups most intense in their utilization of Takfir identify as Sufi. This would include a prominent Sufi group in Lebanon and some of the Sufi orders in the Indian subcontinent. In this regard, let us ask who declared the popular Muslim singer Junaid Jamshed an apostate, forcing him to temporarily leave Pakistan, fleeing for his life? It was not the Salafis. ISIS, Boko Haram and other “Jihadi” groups, however, have taken Takfir to a macabre extreme rarely witnessed in Muslim history. This extreme is rejected by virtually all Muslims, including most Salafis.

A second issue undergirding extreme “Jihadi” violence is the systematic erosion of the sanctity of life. In no uncertain terms, Islam strongly condemns the murder of innocents and noncombatants, even on the battlefield. Its teachings also endeavor to restrict the loss of life among active combatants. It does so through strong warnings against humans terminating lives that have been sanctified by Almighty God. When the concept of the God-given sanctity of life is lost, the ability and desire to distinguish between combatants, noncombatants, civilians, prisoners of war, women and children is lost. This is a reality likely to afflict anyone who finds himself adrift in the blinding fog of war. Far from being a Salafi issue, it is not even a religious issue, it is a human issue.

One starts losing belief in the sanctity of life when one begins dehumanizing the ""other."" Once that sanctity is lost, one is not killing an innocent human being, one is killing an object, a thing, which is totally undeserving of life. Consider the following chilling words of Steven Green, the American soldier who raped and then murdered a fourteen-year-old Iraqi girl, after massacring her family, and then burning the bodies to hide the evidence of his crime. He stated at his trial, ""There's not a word to describe how much I hated these people... I wasn't thinking of these people as humans."" The process whereby Green and others come to see Iraqis as towelheads and sand-niggers, may be different from the process whereby “Jihadis” come to see their victims as undeserving of life, but the common denominator is war.

A third issue contributing to the extreme violence we are currently witnessing in the Middle East is the unique nature of the apocalyptic reading of Islamic sources taken by ISIS. The feeling that we have literally reached the end of the world is not unique to contemporary violent groups. As the Muslim Ummah approached the end of the First Millennium, many respected scholars, such as Imam Suyuti, wrote treatises declaring the arrival of the Apocalypse. The difference between the vision of those scholars and ISIS is that no classical or contemporary scholar or group has politicized the apocalypse in ways ISIS has and then wedded that politicized interpretation with sensationalized violence.

ISIS’s violent eschatology cannot be described as Salafi, in the sense that it reflects neither the teachings of the early generations of Muslims, nor those of most contemporary Salafi groups. This is extremely important to bear in mind when one attempts to blame Salafism for the emergence of ISIS and related groups. There is a unique set of ideas and circumstances, a perfect storm if you will, one will have to comprehend if one is to truly understand these groups and combat their ideology.

While it is easy to claim that the ""Salafi"" roots of ISIS, Boko Haram, Al Qaeda and others is the cause of the levels of violence currently witnessed in areas where these organizations are operating, it is far more difficult to point to the source of the arms that have made the violence of these groups so lethal. Who armed and provided the logistical infrastructure of what would become Al Qaeda and the Taliban? How did Boko Haram go from being a cult-like organization confined to a single city in Northern Nigeria, to a group that is better armed than the Nigerian army? Who supplied them with their weaponry?

A similar question can be asked about ISIS. How did they gain control of so much advanced weaponry, most of it American? To claim that they got it when Mosul fell is inadequate. Why did 30,000 Iraqi soldiers, armed with heavy American weaponry in that city abandon their positions in the face of approximately 1,500 lightly-armed ISIS fighters? Why was ISIS allowed to truck those weapons across open desert, when destroying them would have been a turkey shoot? Who financed the purchase of the balance of their weapons stockpiles and who sold the arms to them? Answering these questions involve inconvenient truths that will never be mentioned by the pseudo-journalists, pundits and experts so quick to weigh in on the sources of “Jihadi” violence.

A related issue revolves around the question of who is ultimately responsible for creating the conditions that led to the emergence of these murderous groups? Salafism existed in the Middle East and Africa long before ""Jihadi"" murderers appeared on the scene. Yet, there was no Islamic Jihad in Afghanistan before the old Soviet Union and then the American military ripped apart the social fabric of that country. Similarly, there was no ISIS before the US invasion and occupation of Iraq. In Nigeria, Boko Haram began its deadly rampage after the Nigerian regime killed hundreds of its adherents and executed its founder, Muhammad Yusuf, in 2009. To simply attribute the violence of these groups to ""Salafism"" is to ignore the many actual causal factors that triggered and sustain the violence we rightly find so abhorrent.

In conclusion, there are several other issues we could examine in order to get to the roots of the violence we see in many parts of the Muslim world. Ultimately, we are dealing with a massive crisis of ignorance. We need to educate Muslims and non-Muslims alike about our religion and what it says about matters related to dehumanizing members of “other” communities, violence, war and peace. This is a long and challenging process that will require a unified community that respects all of its constituents who are committed to sanity and peace. By simply reducing the cause of ""Jihadi"" violence to Salafism we run the risk of failing to address the real roots of a phenomenon tearing apart far too many Muslim societies. We also run the risk of alienating a lot of sincere, well-meaning Muslims, who, while calling themselves Salafi, are just as outraged by the brutal excesses of so-called ""Jihadis"" as any other Muslim.

I decided I would quit games about 55 days ago - pretty enthusiastically at that. I haven't taken my PS3 with me, and my surface pro having only 64gb means I am only storing it with work related files and books and times of study.

I have become more pious, gotten more religious friends, nicer people.  Even the very thought of opening Twitch.tv or trying to download a game in my mind feels like a waste of time - I can make food in that time, or go out and discover the city, or just city at home and read a book, or pray, or watch a film, develop myself. Gaming is a waste of time.

Life is good. I'm gonna join a gym soon. To be honest, this is what life is about. To be the best possible version of 'you' that you can be. And any less than that is a dishonor to yourself, if you didn't try your hardest. You represent no one except yourself - so represent yourself well. 

Stopping gaming has gotten me into the fashion industry, trying different designer colognes, wear different clothing - be a whole other person. Be happy.

Go out there and develop yourself. If not for yourself, for your future kids/wife, but still do it for yourself kinda too. Cause you deserve it.

2. Price ended up being 120 or so dollars + 48 dollar shipping + 3 extra pounds (british pounds) of shipping (for some reason DHL requested I pay that when the package arrived in the town in which I live, but what's 3 extra pounds at that point) I had to western union the money which took some money off me as well as you need to give money to send money lol. All in all: £124 or so, give or take a bit - I think that's a perfectly reasonable price for a bag that's in actuality £1500+.

3. Shipping: I was told that 2 working days after I WU'd the money, I'd get a tracking number. I did. And the package arrived today. I paid last saturday or sunday AKA it took 5-6 days. I'm fine with that. They had to prepare to send it etc + the package has to travel + it was supposed to arrive yesterday but I couldn't pick it up. It actually took 4 days if you really ask me (if I was present at the first delivery). Good.

4. Quality: I've never owned any LV items so I can't comment on this but honestly, I have seen no flaw - it is perfect. The leather feels real, etc. My sister came over and I showed her the bag and she said it looks incredible, very fashionable and well made. Nothing wrong with the pattern etc. 

5. Dunno how close it looks to an authentic since I've never seen an authentic but I'll tell you it looks incredibly real. Lets keep it at that since that's the most I can do it justice - I see no flaw in any part of it.

6. Customer service was excellent, the guy was awesome. I love how friendly they are with all the ''friend'' etc business - it's kind of endearing. Anyway, they were really cool, kept to their promises, and sent me an incredible bag.

I'ma be real and tell you I have absolutely no idea what this is - I put it in the bag cause it has to have some importance right?: http://i.imgur.com/Y7nABdh.jpg

Besides that this bag is absolutely fantastic quality, looks good, has some nice spots within as you can see in the 9TH pic to put your phone in (I didn't know it had these spots) - there's a place for a laptop specifically within it (my Surface Pro 3 fits perfectly in it). It's squareish shaped so can't be mistaken for a purse, it has a detachable clip thing so you can carry it as luggage rather than an over the shoulder bag. It also has a key to lock the bag but I'm more worried about someone stealing the bag itself than searching the contents within lol. Also I have no idea what to do with the yellow louis vuitton cloth, any ideas what I can use it for? I feel throwing it away has definitely got to be a waste.

I'm going to Uni and it feels like the perfectly fashionable bag for there. I was initially gonna go dark brown but I feel some of it is a bit feminine, and the graphite colourway is dope.

I live in the UK (e.g the NHS orthodontic plan for minors is free) and I have had my braces for almost 2 years now. However, I've applied for University and have gotten an offer from a campus in Malaysia for the course I want to do at their Uni.

Now the problem is that term date starts at 28th of September. I was told that due to my late application I'll be given about an extra 2-3 weeks in case my student VISA takes a while to arrive (meaning I can depart at say the 19th of October at pretty much the latest though this would mean I would have to catch up on all the lessons I missed) However, my treatment is nearly finished. I've only got one appointment on the 10th of October and then 2 appointments on the 8th of November to get my retainers... But I won't be in the country then. 

How can I finish my treatment in a righteous manner without paying excessively - I'm just a student that's going to get a student loan. I've almost finished gathering the costs for my airplane ticket and student visa - I'm not sure I'll be able to afford 3 appointments in Malaysia/Singapore that will offer me the same quality of treatment without taking all the money I don't have? I have no idea what orthodontists are like in South East Asia.

Or should I tell my UK Orthodontist to speed up the process? (Not even sure if that's possible)

Thank God there was some emergency nurses at the festival there who helped me and checked my vitals etc and said I probably suffered from gastroenteritis. It's now wednesday and I'm still throwing up once max twice a day on average, I couldn't finish a shift at work. Loud noises make me nauseous, seeing things move fast makes me nauseous, just sitting here typing this, I am nauseous as hell, having a bucket next to me just in case. I can't eat anything except crackers (very very patiently) or water (slow slow sips). How long do I have to endure this? Like how long does food poisoning last? I checked on the NHS website and it said food poisoning is not that serious but my eyes are tearing up and my mouth is dry (but salivating a lot, in preparation for throwing up I guess?). The GP is closed. I don't think A&amp;E will take me simply because I'm about to throw up, not to mention that if I move too much or get into a car, I will be nauseous and actually throw up. I've been nauseous all day, every day since the day that it started - no real moment when I can relax and feel normal, but I thought this was a normal part of food poisoning so I have toughened it out but this is getting extremely hard with how nauseous I keep getting and it now being the fifth day.

I don't mean nauseous as in oh I'm feeling a bit unwell, but as in I'm trying to actively prevent vomiting by restricting movement/activity etc. I've been in bed all day and I am still on the urge of vomiting which I have been trying to stop.

My brother got me some bismuth subsalicylate (Peptobismol) from the pharmacy today but it hasn't helped even alleviate my nausea though I took it several hours ago.

Do not leave any gaps for the Shaytaan. Whoever complete a row, Allaah will reward him, and whoever breaks a row, Allaah will forsake him. 


I'm usually kind of annoyed when when toes touch as it can be distracting. Tonight however, I noticed the person next to me had black toes e.g he was black, and it dawned upon me that just a century or so ago in this country, people would actively try to prevent such things happening, and in pre-Islamic Arabia they would think it be a disgrace that two people of different colour stand side by side as if they are equal. But in Islam, we look past that - not because we pretend to be equal, but because we *are* equal. And instead of slight annoyance, I became awed that in that moment, I was allowed to share that bond with the brother next to me, connected at our toes perhaps, but it signifies a greater thing in terms of our progress as humanity in the sight of Allah. In that raka'ah we were friends. I did not know his name, but it was an honor to share a moment with my brother and insha'Allah he'll receive Jannah al Firdaws al Ala.

I've just finished my A Levels (Bio, Chem, Maths, and Theology) - whether I go to Exeter for university this September will depend on the outcome of my grades (fingers crossed) - but basically I have free time. And lots of it for at least 2 and a half months. If you guys know any openings or need someone for a short period of time, full time or part time doesn't really matter, I'll be your man! The job itself doesn't really matter for the most part e.g in regards to what it is (Paid jobs of course, not voluntary work). 

I think putting my CV here is a bit too personal although if you request it I would PM it to you. I've had experience working in a Care Home, a Hospital, and an Insurance department (The Co-operative in town) for various lengths. Very professional, enthusiastic, quite sociable too. Used to be Head Boy, part of the Student Council, and also am currently part of Manchester Youth Council. I don't care whether the job is being a sales assistant, or helping feeding the elderly or cleaning their dishes or whatever. It's all good.  

I live 15 mins away from Town so I'm mostly looking into that area but in the end I'm taking buses anyway so it doesn't matter where it is (within reason)
