0,"Castanzo has looked awful at times. He and Allen are the two biggest disappointments for me, because expectations were high.

The biggest surprises have been D'Qwell, Walden and (obviously) Jack Doyle.

 I had completely written off D'Qwell before the season, but he's stepped up and played better than I thought he could. Walden is getting better at pressuring the QB. And Jack Doyle is playing like we thought Allen would.

Quite a bit is personnel though. Moncrief is by far our most physical WR, but he's been injured.  Neither RB has proven themselves a reliable pass catcher in the offense (sorry Frank, I still love you). Allen can't seem to hold on to the football, and Jack Doyle is a homegrown hero but not a world beater.

We've seen a little success with TE screen here and there, but the WRs can't get separation fast enough for a quick strike offense. When Moncrief comes back hopefully we can move in that direction. Allen stepping up more would be nice too (he did have that TD against CHI).

85,"I've been wondering this all season. There are really only three good answers.

1. Draw plays. Gore does much better with a full head of steam, not dancing in the backfield. However, we still run too many draw plays with gore as it is (see: DET), so idk if that's correct.

2. Check downs to the RB. If the coaches don't trust gore to catch and run, they could pull him for Ferguson. This makes some sense as he does seem to drop passes near the LOS. However, Ferguson is no better than Gore at this, so it doesn't seem right either.

3. Our tendency to split the RB out wide when in shotgun. This seems to be the most likely answer. Gore is not a great downfield route runner, and the D probably doesn't respect him in that role. Splitting Ferguson out wide vs. man coverage keeps the defense honest while creating mismatches.

Gore is far and away the better pass blocker. These are the only reasons I could come up with to take him out of the game on third down. Obviously they mostly apply to shotgun formation. If anyone has other suggestions I'd love to hear them.

Of course, there's always ""to keep him fresh"", but that didn't work at all last season, and makes little sense in an offense that thrives at a high tempo. If he can't handle an up tempo offense, he's the wrong RB for this team. I don't think that's the case. Also, the plays that take the biggest toll on a RB are not 3rd down plays from the shotgun, they're runs between the tackles. The Colts aren't limiting those runs by replacing Gore with Turbin; they simply don't view Gore as a third down or shotgun back.

Those teams (2012/13) were worse than this team. They made it far because they got lucky. Everyone constantly said we would regress to the mean in one score games. We have.

Think back in all those incredible fourth quarter comebacks. They were only possible because Luck played like the best QB in the league for a half. But a lot of them were sheer luck. One play goes differently, and we lose.

This season, we've already seen twice how one (or a few) plays can totally change a game in the fourth quarter. 3-0 was entirely possible at this point, as was 0-3.

121,"I think he will mostly be a rotational player until we know for sure where he fits into this defense. From what I can tell, he does everything well but nothing great. I think his most natural position is behind Walden or behind D'Qwell.



If he plays behind Walden, he'll probably rotate at SOLB, and play opposite him against run-heavy formations. the same is probably true if he plays behind DQ.

I could see him starting alongside DQ if none of the young guys pan out, but that duo is seriously limited in coverage ability. 

He could also play next to Geathers at ILB if Clayton comes down as an LB. that might be his most effective position.

Overall, I see him more as a run stopping LB than a pass rushing LB, though he could be called upon to do both. He's definitely versatile, and he adds depth across all four LB positions.

I wouldn't expect much from him early on, but as the season progresses we could see quite a bit of Ayers.

But if those two and Kelly can play like we expect throughout the year, Luck should have more time to throw than any previous season. 

Between Reitz, Good, Harrison, Clark and Haeg, we should have two serviceable players for the right side. Gore staying healthy will be huge as well, he stonewalled a few blitzers in the Raven's game. 

The real problem will be finding check downs near the LOS and opening running lanes. Allen and Gore are the obvious go-tos, but they may be preoccupied with blocking or covered by LBs. The top three WR may struggle to get separation underneath. I think the short-intermediate crossing routes will be our best friend this season. One wideout coming underneath while the other two push the coverage downfield should be pretty effective against most defenses.

156,"* The DL is by far our best position group on defense. IF 2/3 of Anderson, Langford and Jones stay healthy and play most of the season, we should be ok stopping the run and forcing some inside pressure. Behind those guys we have a nice little rotation with McGill, Parry, the rookie Ridgeway, Kerr, and others.

* The LBs are our weakest unit on the entire team. At ILB, DQ Jackson puts up tackle numbers, but doesn't play very well in coverage. Moore and Irving are promising, but unknown, replacements for Freeman (who went to CHI). We have a few other projects but nobody really worth noting at this point.

* OLB is a mess. Mathis showed some promise against bad tackles, but can't really be counted on to repeat what he did in 2013. Trent Cole offered little to nothing last year. Eric Walden is a solid edge- setter but usually struggles to rush the passer. Behind those three it's a bunch of inexperienced players.

* The secondary at least upgraded CB2 (god I hope...) by replacing Toler with Patrick Robinson. Vontae and Robinson should be a decent 1-2. Safety is the bigger question mark. Mike Adams is getting up there in age, though I think he can play at a high level for one more season. The other safety should be Geathers, but he's been injured through camp and preseason, and is really more of an in-the-box safety or an ILB than a true coverage S. We may shift our slot CB, Darius Butler, to S and let Smith, our third-round pick from last year, start at slot CB. Geathers could then help the ILBs in coverage closer to the LoS, especially vs. TEs. TJ Green was our second draft pick this year, and he has looked pretty good at S through camp. Hopefully we won't ask him to start this season, but he could end up playing if these injuries continue.

Obviously there are a lot of question marks on this defense. Much of the season is riding on young guys stepping up. Yet our defense was better last year than the stats would indicate. When the offense could move the ball, the D played decently. There were so many 3-outs that our players couldn't stay fresh. An improved OL and a healthy Luck should help sustain drives, and make the defense more effective. I'd say the potential for a 16-10 ranked D is there, provided some key players stay healthy. We will struggle with the elite QBs (Rivers, Rodgers, Big Ben scare me the most), but so does everyone. Hopefully pass protection improves enough to keep the team close in shoot outs.

348,"Blurb by Ben Gundy about Joe Reitz in the TB game:

""Reitz continued his exceptional season with a strong game at left tackle, putting up run and pass blocking scores slightly better than Castonzo’s season averages (84% and 94%, respectively). That doesn’t mean that Reitz is a better left tackle than Castonzo, of course, but it shows once again how valuable Reitz is. Since the Colts ended this year’s round of inexplicably leaving Reitz on the bench in favor of inferior players, he’s been a consistent stabilizing force, especially in pass protection.

The biggest wart in Reitz’s game is his run blocking. Although, like the rest of the line, he had a good overall run blocking score, his gap blocking left something to be desired. Castonzo has been easily the team’s best run blocker this season, and the Colts clearly missed him. Reitz has quick feet and more power than you might expect, but he doesn’t do a great job of leveraging defenders out of the way to create running lanes. He’s also surprisingly poor at the second level, where he has trouble tracking and locking on.

Still, in the more important area of pass protection, Reitz looked sharp on Sunday. Good run blocking is generally more fun to watch than good pass blocking, but Reitz’s pass blocking is a thing of beauty.""

685,"Thanks for the feedback! 

1. I like Spence but his college troubles worry me. As far as I know Floyd comes without the character ?s, which seems important to this FO. I also like that Floyd won't have to make a transition like Spence. Drafting another DE to convert to OLB in the first round concerns me, especially following Werner.

2. I actually think ILB is the thinnest and least talented position group on the team. Jackson may miss time with his conviction and isn't very good regardless. Irving and Moore are completely unproven. Geathers is needed at SS. This group lacks youth and talent, and Ragland in the second is exceptional value.

3. I'm fine with taking Martin or Kelly in the second. With no trades on Fanspeak it makes things a little simplistic, but I think we can all agree the Colts need a C in this draft. 

4. Turner was the best G available. I'm not completely sold on him but the OL needs a truly powerful run blocker and he fits the bill.

5. Totally valid criticism. He was the bpa in my opinion but there were other good players to choose from. That said, I think he provides good value as a fifth round pick, especially given his experience with timing routes. 

7. Latham wouldn't even be a lock to make the roster, so whatever, really.

950,"Chuck Pagano is the problem with the Colts.

Is he a great coach? No. But I'd say he's above average. The same cannot be said of the talent supplied by GM Ryan Grigson, especially on the offensive line. A quick refresher on the OL FAs signed by Grigson in his tenure:

Samson Satele

Mike McGlynn

Donald Thomas

Gosder Cherilus (team's highest paid player in 2013)

Lance Louis

Phil Costa

Todd Herremans 

As of today, none of them are with the team. In four years Grigson has added one truly competent lineman: Jack Mewhort. Keep in mind Grigson played along the OL. He had one goal after his first season: Protect 12. He has objectively failed.

It would take a miracle postseason run for Pagano to keep his job. I get that. But if Irsay lets Chuck walk and keeps Grigson, I will be pissed. He is the reason Luck missed half this season, and has proven he will not be able to protect the future of this franchise.

1037,"Linebackers, linebackers, and linebackers. Especially if we stick with the 3-4 next season. Both ILB and OLB are huge weaknesses at key positions. Mathis and Cole aren't playing like we'd hoped, while Jackson and Freeman can't cover. A blue chip player at either position would help tremendously.

Following that, I'd say OL, preferably a C or RG. This FO loves utility players, though, so if Grigson is still around he'd probably opt for another versatile OL. There are a few different ways this line could be structured if we picked up any solid OL rookie.

I'd list DB next, since our 5 starting DBs are all on FA level contracts. Smith may be able to replace Butler or Toler at some point, but we haven't seen enough from him yet (mostly due to injury). Adams and Lowery have Geathers behind, but another young safety wouldn't hurt, especially one known as a ball hawk.

Fourth on my list would be RB. Gore is fantastic, but old, and I don't have faith in any other RB on this roster to be a game changer. Getting someone in place behind Gore to learn from him could be huge.

Depending on what happens with Fleener and Allen, TE may be a real need as well. DL could struggle down the stretch without Anderson, and I doubt Jones will be back next year, so that's also a position to think about. 

TLDR: Linebackers(!!!), OL (anywhere but LT really), DB (CB&gt;S), RB, TE/DL

 Stannis has Theon and Asha along with several missing Ironborn ships, Dagmer still holds Torrhen's square, Wex was in White Harbor communicating with the Glovers and Manderlys. And don't forget Theon knows of a gate that's never guarded in the Dreadfort.

Victarion is in slaver's bay when war breaks out with a horn that (supposedly) controls dragons, as well as a fleet and Moqorro. The fact that he reached Slaver's bay before Volantis' fleet means he stands between them and Mereen.

Euron has already captured the Shield Islands and clearly has plans for Oldtown, the Riverlands, KL and Westeros. Since Aurane Waters stole the royal fleet, only the Redwynes and those hidden Manderly ships remain to oppose him at sea.

1085,Good. No point in forcing Thigpen into the game when he hasn't been playing for weeks. We're much better off with Whalen as the return man and using the extra roster spots on defense.,2015-10-17 16:39:19+00:00,cw31rcf,1.0,t3_3p42pz,8943.0,Colts
1086,"First of all, I think we'd go for it on 4th in that situation. Second, our plan is to score every time we have the ball every time we play anyone. The reason our offense has suck so hard vs. NE is because it was entirely one dimensional. No running game means no play action and nobody open downfield.

Gore needs 100 yards if we are going to win. Look at how KC won big last season. Charles kept the LBs honest and Smith used play action. If we just air it out over and over we'll be punting each drive and down 21 before we know it. ",2015-10-16 13:55:11+00:00,cw1tn45,3.0,t1_cw0s4w2,77003.0,Colts

If I have to predict exact W/L, I'd say we lose to NE, CAR and ATL as well as PITT. Though 9-7 or 11-5 is also possible. ",2015-10-16 13:06:44+00:00,cw1s752,3.0,t1_cw1n9mu,17687.0,Colts

1282,"What talent has Pagano had to work with on the defensive side? Let's revisit the LBs (playmakers in a 3-4) Chuck has to work with:

OLB

* Robert Mathis- converted DE who was here long before Grigson and missed all of last season

* Erik Walden- the only legitimate OLB Grigson has brought in, and he still under performs and is over paid

* Bjoern Werner- 1st round draft pick project player who converted to OLB and has chronically underperformed

* Jonothan Newsome- 5th round draft pick from Ball State

* Trent Cole- new this year, jury still out

* Fringe players like Cam Johnson, Andy Studebaker and Daniel Adongo

ILB

* Jerrell Freeman- CFL FA, a solid but not outstanding option

* D'Qwell Jackson- Can't cover a Tupperware container with Saran Wrap

* Nate Irving- Still rehabbing that torn ACL

* Amarrlo Herrera- Who?

* Pat Angerer- here before Grigson and a terrible scheme fit

* Kavell Connor- traded from Buf for Jerry Hughes, then cut

On that entire list there are two passable LBs (Mathis, Freeman), four if we are being extra generous (Walden, Newsome). That doesn't even begin to cover all the FA busts at other positions (Landry, RJF, Franklin, etc.) 

Grigson simply hasn't given Pagano the talent to create the defense he has in mind. And Chuck has still crafted a solid D who excelled in some metrics (3rd down %) despite having no pass rush or stand out DL. Don't blame Pagano for the meal when Grigson picked the ingredients.

1421,"Absolutely we can beat them, Tom or Jim. I wouldn't bet money on us until I see it happen (unless the +/- is really outlandish), but aside from typical ""Any Given Sunday"" rhetoric, we do legitimately have a chance.

Last year's LoS matchup was close at halftime before we lost Bradshaw. If Gore can give us a respectable running game, it'll take a ton of pressure off Luck, give our offense the ability to control the clock, force defenders out of their depleted secondary, and impact their run-first game plan (assuming we score TDs in the RZ. That is key!).

On defense, I'm more worried about their TE pairing than their running game. NE isn't particularly deep at WR, so we need our best cover guys on Gronk (Davis?) and Chandler (Geathers?). Stopping the run only becomes really important if they get the lead, so pressure Brady early and hopefully we can slow their offense and score some points before they feel comfortable bringing in 6 OL every play.

NE will be very good in the RZ on offense too, so it's important we make them drive the length of the field (no turnovers- another problem a real running game should help). Remember Brady was sacked twice and picked (at least once iirc) before they started going 6 OL. We need to make them one dimensional by taking away the pass as best as we can. 

All of this is easier said than done, but they did lose a lot of talent in the secondary, and we are much more talented than last season. They have a nasty front 7 when healthy and scary TEs, but we have a real RB this year and unmatched speed at WR.

-Trent Cole has been playing multiple positions within the front seven, like Newsome did last season.

-Werner is taking a large amount of snaps at Strong Side OLB, where he should excel as a run defender.

I think Reitz will win the starting job at LG, unless Heenan comes out of nowhere. Thorton will be OL6, a role he occupied at the end of last season (and one he did quite well in). 

The problems come with injuries. If Castonzo, Mewhort, Reitz and Herremans play full seasons, our line will be much better than last year. Sadly we can't count on that happening, which is why there's a chance Reitz retains his back up role. We need him healthy in a pinch. 

The wild cards are Louis and Thomas. I don't see much potential for Louis, but maybe another season with the team will help him. If Thomas can keep from tearing that quad for a third time, I'd be curious to see him at C, or if the coaches want to help ensure he's healthy, make him the most expensive back up in the league (still more than he's contributed since arriving.) Obviously there's a chance he wins a starting G job, but he'll need to actually get on the field for that to happen. 

The bottom line is that this unit needs consistency. If any of the top guys get injured, we look at lot more like a bottom OL than we do right now. If we can keep the same group on the field, they should be at least average.",2015-07-28 13:45:51+00:00,ctiydxw,2.0,t1_ctilxzs,36085.0,nfl

1529,"* We have an incredibly talented group of young offensive players in Andrew Luck (one of the league's best QBs going into only his 4th season), TY Hilton, Donte Moncrief, and Phillip Dorsett (all WRs with world-class speed), and the TEs Coby Fleener and Dwayne Allen (the duo set an NFL record with 8 TDs each last season). This team is practically guaranteed to score lots of points come Sunday. 

* The team has advanced further every year in the playoffs since 2012; at this pace, we'll be in the Super Bowl this season. Winning it all is a very realistic expectation as long as Andrew Luck is under center, which he should be for many years to come. 

* Speaking of Luck, he's one of the few QBs who truly enjoys the physical aspect of the game. Luck never shies away from contact, and is excellent when running and throwing on the run. He also exemplifies sportsmanship. I've never heard of another QB [congratulating the defender who just knocked him down.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/andrew-luck-the-nfls-most-perplexing-trash-talker-1418663249) Luck does this every time he takes a hit. How cool is that? Not to mention he's as selfless, humble and intellectual as they come in the NFL.

* This team is never out of a game, regardless of the score. Not many franchises can say that. Look our playoff game against Kansas City in 2013; the Colts were down **five touchdowns** in the second half before rallying to win. I was there that night, and let me tell you, you'll never experience a more electrifying evening. 

* Aside from our current success and bright future, we have a great culture here. Indianapolis is a midwestern city, and we pride ourselves on our hospitality. In my ten years of attending games I've never seen a visiting fan harassed in our stadium. 

* Our subreddit is the whackiest in the NFL. We love photoshop (both good and bad), side-bar bets and outlandish banners. We never take ourselves too seriously. 

* I could go much deeper into our team history if you'd like, but suffice it to say we have developed a winning program. No team has won more games in a decade then the Colts did from 2000-2009 with Peyton Manning. We've been in a position to make the Super Bowl every year since 2002 (aside from the dreaded 2011 season). And our future is only growing brighter. 

This is the team I love. If you really want to be convinced we're the best in the NFL, all you have to do is come to town for a game.

4500 sounds about right for Luck. I'd be fine with under if it means he doesn't have to throw as much (4300).

Over 40 TDs. A lot of big passes stopped at the goal line last year.

Gore won't sniff 10 TDs. Over 5 would be a good season.

Unless he's averaging 5 ypc, I hope Gore doesn't hit 1,000. I'm actually working on a post about what to expect from Gore this season, and 200 carries, 800 yards (12.5 rushes a game) is what I landed on. Keeps him fresh for the playoffs and predicts a slight decline in ypc from 2014.

Not sure on Johnson yet, but 800 sounds pretty close. Gut says slightly over, but I will probably look deeper at his numbers on my next day off.

Again, need to look more at his numbers, but 5 TDs seems a little low for Johnson in this offense. He'll be a major target in the red zone, and Luck will look to him frequently early in the season. Over.

1556,"Areas of improvement: Both lines are no brainers, and I think both will get better this season. The OL actually wasn't horrible at run blocking all the time, but between their mistakes and Trent's it was hard to get anything going.

 I think its time we move on from Cherilus and Thomas. Gosder was downright awful most of last season (not great before the injury, terrible after) and Thomas is just wasted cap space. Move Mewhort to RT and let Louis/Thorton/Heenan/Reitz battle it out for LG. 

C shouldn't be any worse than the second half of last season. Harrison needs to clean up the mental errors but he has potential as an interior guy. If Holmes stays healthy he isn't the end of the world at center either. 

On DL, Jones needs to stay healthy for this unit to click. If he does we should be ok. There are plenty of talented young players to rotate in at each position. And at least one of Chapman, Kerr, or Parry needs to step up. If Mathis and Irving both recover fully they'll take a lot of pressure off the DL.

Rookies: Now that the shock has worn off, Dorsett seems like a brilliant move, especially over Brown with Langford and two rookie DL on the roster. Hilton, Moncrief and Dorsett together on the field is probably what I'm most excited for in 2015. They have the speed between them to obliterate secondaries.

Dany ran around as Queen of a pillaging Khalasar and was probably showered with gifts along the way. After Drogo died and her plucky band arrived in Qaarth, she was once again showered with gifts.
