My first thought for a potential partner would Buffalo. The Bills signed Reggie Bush at the start of this month to return kicks, but they might be interested in trading for a little more versatility. They are also very deep at both Safety and Corner.

Luck's contract really isn't that bad for the team, and by the time we are signing players for real money again, the cap will have increased enough to offset the difference.

R1 P18- Traded to Denver for R1 P31 and R2 P32

R1 P31- Ryan Kelly

Kelly fell to me after the trade, and I couldn't be happier. He's a day one starter at a position of need, and represents great value at 31.

R2 P18- Vernon Butler

I'm not convinced Butler will be there when we pick in the second, but if he is I'd be thrilled to pick him up. There are a couple of DL prospects ahead of him in this draft, so you never know who could fall. I see him as a NT in our scheme, or as a possible replacement for Langford in a season.

R2 P32- Darian Thompson

Multiple reports have stated the Colts love Thompson, and adding him at the end of round 2 would be huge for this team. He can replace Mike Adams next season, and if Geathers develops into more of a traditional SS, Thompson can step in as the center fielding FS. This pick helps the secondary get younger and cheaper, something that needs to happen sooner than later.

R3 P19- Jaylon Smith/ Kamalei Correa 

Both players were available midway through the third round, and 
either pick would make me happy. Smith is obviously a risk and an investment in 2017, but if he returns to form he'd be the steal of the draft. After adding 3 potential starters in the first two rounds, I'm comfortable taking a chance on a projected top-5 pick.

As for Correa, a lot of mocks have him going sooner, but I think a third round grade is reasonable. He'd contribute this season and is a natural fit at OLB. He's definitely the safer pick, but his ceiling seems lower. I'd go with Smith, but Correa highlights the fact that there are a lot of good options in this range.

R4-7 can afford a bit of reaching at positions of need thanks to four strong picks in the first three rounds. I know handing a conference rival a starting QB is a risky move, but the Saints sent Seattle Graham last year, and I'm not sold on Lynch as a long term starter. All in all, I think adding more picks this draft sets this roster up for success.

1. Leonard Floyd, OLB- I'm becoming more convinced every day that if Floyd is available at 18 he's the pick. He fits our scheme, a need, and he has the size and athleticism to make it in this league (provided he packs on some muscle). He also seems to love the game and is a relatively safe pick.

2. Reggie Ragland, ILB- Many people have a first round grade on Ragland, but I don't buy it. He seems too one dimensional to be worthy of a first round pick. He may not fall past the halfway point in round two, but I doubt he goes in the first. There's a decent chance he's available when we pick in the second, and if he is, I think we should take him. He can replace the recently convicted Jackson as our run stopping ILB.

3. Nick Martin, C- Leadership and play style seem like a perfect fit for this team. Appears to be a dependable solution at a position of weakness. Provides some depth at guard in a pinch as well.

4. Landon Turner, G- Powerful guard who can substantially help the running game, especially on the right side. May need help inside against pass rushers, but has the strength to hold up vs. big defensive linemen. 

5. Aaron Burbridge, WR- Solid BPA selection with experience and athleticism. Takes pressure off the ""smurfs"" with route running and height. Will be given time to develop his game as the fourth or fifth WR. I liked him better than the available RBs, but there were other viable options at this pick.

6. N/A

7. Darius Latham, DT- Homegrown talent with NFL size. Legitimate rotational piece with a chance to be more if he keeps his head on straight. The hope is that playing for his hometown team will inspire him to make smart decisions; if not, it's only a seventh round pick. At 6'4, 311, I envision him as a NT.

I went in with a simple rule: draft the highest rated player on D or OL, according to the board, without repeating a position. Here are the results (# order = draft board order)-

1. Darron Lee, Kenny Clark, Nick Martin
2. Ronnie Stanley, Su'a Cravens, Ryan Kelly
3. A'Shawn Robinson, Leonard Floyd, Nick Martin
4. Reggie Ragland, Ryan Kelly, Kamalei Correa
5. Noah Spence, Ryan Kelly, Willy Henry

9. Robert Nkemdiche, Bronson Kaufusi, Su'a Cravens
10. Reggie Ragland, Kyler Fackrell, Landon Turner/ Darron Lee
11. Darron Lee, Josh Garnett, Ryan Kelly

Notes: 

Some of these boards seemed way off to me. Darron Lee was just below Landon Turner in the 3rd round in the 10th draft. That's unrealistic. 

Ryan Kelly consistently fell to the second/third round as well, though a second round grade may not be too far off for him.

Jaylon Smith went in the top ten once. I don't think that'll be the case.

Both times I selected Ragland there were edge rushers still available, usually Floyd, Spence, or Lee. However, my rules prevented me from taking them.

Zeke fell to the Panthers once. I doubt that'll happen but I thought it was funny.

The worst scenario for the Colts is that no QBs are taken before we pick. That doesn't seem likely though. If CLE, SF, or anyone else takes a QB, a prospect worthy of the 18th pick is pretty much guaranteed to fall.

It's an important question for Colts fans. Our nemesis is king of the AFCE, and we are matched up with that division this season. In the past, the AFC East rarely fields a playoff team outside of NE.  This year, however, at least Buffalo is for real.

The Bills defense has immense potential. Ryan's blitzes made Luck look bad while holding our high-powered offense to 14 measly points, and one of his best players wasn't even on the field. With that combination of talent and intelligence on defense, Buffalo could become the AFC's answer to Seattle: an extremely aggressive defense and ST, an excellent running back, and a QB athletic and talented enough to sustain drives. 

We will know a lot more about the Bills after they play NE in week 2. If they win or come very close, I think most of this panic will seem overblown. If NE destroys Buffalo, I will be pissed along with many of you.

Our second string defense held Chicago's starters to a field goal despite poor special teams play. 

Coming into the game, all I wanted was a close score (or a lead) at halftime. We had the lead and it would've been even bigger if Luck ran a fourth series. Obviously there are still concerns, but all of these chicken little hot takes seem stupid. Dorsett, Robinson, Anderson, Parry, and Geathers have all inspired confidence.

Let me first say that I am beyond excited to watch a real RB carry the football this season. Gore is by far my favorite offseason addition, and I can't wait to see him pound it every Sunday.

My question is this: Over the last 4 season, Frank's caught hardly any passes. I can't find any stats on targets, but 72 catches in 64 (regular season) games seems very low to me. Bradshaw had 38 catches in 10 games for Indianapolis last season alone. 

Why such low receiving numbers? I was at Colts training camp on Sunday and saw Gore split out like a WR more than once. Indy relies on our RB to catch passes, especially screens and check downs. Is this something Gore can be counted on to do? Not that I'm doubting his ability, just curious why he wasn't thrown to much the last four years.

Thanks in advance, wishing your team the best this season. ",49ers,Colts Fan Looking to Talk Gore,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/3gmrf3/colts_fan_looking_to_talk_gore/

-Luck spent the warm up period throwing exclusively to Allen and Fleener, while pretty much everyone else did calistetics. 

-QBs and KR do interesting drills where assistant coaches throw large exercise balls and rolled up towels at them while they try to make plays.

-Absent Davis and Butler, the secondary had a pretty good day. I remember one play specifically in 11v11 where Toler had a great pass break up from Luck to T.Y. Jalil Brown forced a fumble against Moncrief in the RZ as well.

-Gore turned the corner on a RZ play that looked DOA and scored a TD. He also had a bad drop on an easy pass. 

-Geathers covered Gore on a few routes and made some solid (would-be) tackles, but I didn't see him make any plays on the ball. Didn't notice if he covered the TEs at all.

I will update with more if they come to mind.

Edit: Spent some time watching Mewhort and Herremans. They looked good enough in pass protection but not great when run blocking.

The back looks quite good so far in camp.

Is there a good tailgating crowd or do most people head straight for Colts City? Is there room for pop-up canopies? We tailgate at most home games so we already have a lot of supplies; is there anything in particular we should bring? Can you grill in the lot?

**Defense**

**Defensive Line- Sell**

Major Gains: Kendall Langford, Henry Anderson, David Parry

Major Losses: Cory Redding, RJF

Cory Redding has been the heart and soul of this DL since joining the team; he won't be easily replaced. Langford has struggled recently, and despite moving back to his preferred 3-4, he likely won't replicate Redding's production. Anderson and Parry could be solid, but they will need time to develop. A healthy and productive Arthur Jones or a progressing Josh Chapman could move the ticker to hold or buy, but for now DL is a sell.

**Outside LB- Buy**

Major Gains: Robert Mathis (INJ), Trent Cole, Newsome year 2

Major Losses: Shaun Phillips

The eventual return of Robert Mathis will be a huge boost to the pass rush, but even if it isn't until November, OLB should still improve from last season. Trent Cole is an upgrade over Shaun Phillips (who contributed little in his limited snaps), and Newsome should get better with another year. Werner had his best production in 2014, and if healthy can contribute as well. Yes the group could use another upgrade, but regardless it should be better than last season.

**Inside LB- Hold**

Major Gains: Nate Irving (INJ), Amarlo Herrera

Major Losses: Andrew Jackson

Listing Jackson as a major loss is a bit inaccurate, as he really didn't contribute much at all last season. Assuming Nate Irving recovers from his injury, he should be the run-stuffing ILB the team wanted in Jackson. The expectations for Herrera are not and shouldn't be very high, but as long as Freeman and D'Qwell don't regress significantly, the position should at least be a hold.

**Cornerback- Buy**

Major Gains: D'Joun Smith

Major Losses: Josh Gordy

The CB position was a strength for the Colts last season, and with the top three guys returning, the unit should be solid once again. Gordy is gone, but he struggled in coverage last season. D'Joun Smith seems like an adequate replacement with a high ceiling. As long as this group stays healthy, they should be the highlight of the defense.

**Safety- Buy**

Major Gains: Dwight Lowery, Clayton Geathers

Major Losses: LaRoid Landry, Sergio Brown

Dropping Landry is more like addition by subtraction; the dude had trouble making it on the field, and when he did, he couldn't cover. When you add in his massive contract, PED suspension, and OTA absences, the team is better off without him. Lowery doesn't look like an all-star signing, but neither did Mike Adams last season. If Lowery can at least cover that's more than can be said of Landry. Geathers looks like a promising draft pick, and the hardest hitter of this group. With guys like Dewey McDonald and Colt Anderson developing on ST, this position should be at least as good as last season.

**Offense- Skill Positions**

**Quarterback- Buy**

Major Gains: Andrew Luck year 4

Major Losses: None

After leading the league in TD passes last season, Andrew Luck returns for year 4. He will be one of the top QBs in the league. I could talk about Luck all day, but suffice it to say this should be his best season yet. Hasselbeck will back him up once again. Aside from another year of development, nothing has changed for this team at QB.

**Running Back- Buy**

Major Gains: Frank Gore, Josh Robinson

Major Losses: Ahmad Bradshaw, Trent Richardson

It sucks to see Bradshaw cut because of his health. In the past two seasons he's become one of my favorite players, despite only playing in a handful of games. The same cannot be said of Trent Richardson, who never seemed to put it all together, and became more of a distraction than anything else.

Replacing them are Frank Gore and Josh Robinson, who should be better than what we fielded last season provided they stay healthy. Boom Herron is also coming back, and will see the field quite a bit if he can learn how to hold on to the ball. Tipton and Ballard are worth mentioning, but I don't expect much from either of them.

**Wide Receiver- Buy**

Major Gains: Andre Johnson, Phillip Dorsett, Duron Carter, Donte Moncrief year 2

Major Losses: Reggie Wayne, Hakeen Nicks

Sadly, Reggie Wayne will play with the Colts no more. It will be so weird and heartbreaking to watch Indy's offense with no 87 out there. He will always be remembered as a Colts great.

That said, holy crap this is an exciting group. T.Y. Hilton has improved every year since 2012, and will continue to in 2015. Andre Johnson should exceed Reggie's production from last season, as Wayne really struggled at times. Hakeem Nicks didn't fare much better, providing some clutch catches but never consistent production. Moncrief should be able to at least match what Nicks contributed last year. Then there is Phillip Dorsett, who's blazing speed has drawn comparisons to Hilton. If he looks anything like T.Y. did as a rookie, these wide receivers will be close to uncoverable. Add CFL star Duron Carter into the mix, and the Colts have unmatched talent and depth at WR.

**Tight End- Buy**

Major Gains: Dwayne Allen year 4, Coby Fleener year 4

Major Losses: None

If Dwayne Allen puts together a close-to-full season without missing any huge games, this could be the best TE duo in football. The two combined for 16 TDs last season, setting an NFL record at 8 apiece. With the depth and talent this team has at WR, Allen and Fleener may see the field less than originally intended. That could be a good thing, as Allen hasn't played a full season since 2012. Resting him as needed will go a long way towards keeping him healthy. 

Meanwhile Fleener was the second-most productive pass catcher on this team the last two seasons. His chemistry with Luck is improving every year, and he should line up against a lot LBs and Safeties in 2015. That will mean tons of yards and points for Luck's former roommate. Jack ""of-all-trades"" Doyle, basketball convert Eric Swoope and journeyman Sean McGrath also deserve mention, but they probably won't put up eye popping stats.

**Offensive Line**

*Disclaimer: I still expect some major shuffling along the line come training camp.*

**Left Tackle- Buy** 

Major Gain: Costanzo year 4

Major Loss: None

Costanzo should hold down the blindside again without any problem.

**Left Guard- Hold**

Major Gains: Jack Mewhort year 2, Ben Heenan

Major Loss: None

Left Guard is a hold until we find out what is happening with Gosder Cherilus. If Mewhort is staying at LG, the position is a buy; if he's moving to Right Tackle, it's a sell. CFL standout Ben Heenan is a sleeper to make the roster.

**Center- Sell**

Major Gain: None

Major Loss: AQ Shipley

If Jonotthan Harrison or Khaled Holmes take a big step forward, I'll be pleasantly surprised. At this point I'm skeptical that either will play better than Shipley did in his handful of starts last season. Unless a young guy steps up or another OL moves to center, it'll be hard to list this position higher than a hold.

**Right Guard- Buy**

Major Gain: Todd Herremans
 
Major Loss: None

Herremans should be better than Hugh Thorton, who will make a decent backup. Either player (or Heenan) could also start at LG.

**Right Tackle- Hold**

Major Gains: None

Major Loss: None

Gosder Cherilus started at RT last season, and didn't exactly play well. He was adequate against weaker teams before getting injured, and then stunk in several outings before going to IR. He is currently rehabbing that injury, but the team has been starting Mewhort at RT during OTAs.

 If Cherilus comes back from IR and starts, I see this position as a sell. Gosder was on the decline before his injury, and I can't see him playing better than in 2014.  If the team cuts Cherilus and moves Mewhort to RT, it seems like a hold or buy to me. Mewhort played well last season and was a RT in college. I don't think he'll be any worse than an aging and injured Gosder Cherilus.

*Never count out a Joe Reitz sighting at any of these positions.*

**Conclusion/ TLDR**

Defense- 3 buys, 1 hold, 1 sell

Offense (Skill)- 4 buys

Offense (Line)- 2 buys, 2 holds, 1 sell

Defense- **Buy**: While I didn’t go into specific positions for DL and LB, I still think my analysis is somewhat accurate. If it can stay healthy, this defense should be better than last season’s.

Offense (Skill)- **Buy**: Quarterback, Running Back, Wide Receiver and Tight End should all improve from 2014. This offense is a buy and will be one of the best in the NFL.

Offense (Line)- **Hold**: Aside from losing Shipley, the offense line shouldn’t be worse than last season. Given the unit played its best games in January, that’s an encouraging sign. A hold is fair for now.

Let me know what you think in the comments! If someone feels like going into individual positions on defense, I’m happy to add your analysis to mine (while giving you credit of course).
