2,"My first question would be, what are you going to do with it after it's in datastore? Since you meantioned python, are you planning to use [NDB](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) or just [Cloud Datastore APIs](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview)?

That said, or asked, yea you have quite a bit of flexibility. I see two easiest options (IMO).

1. Use [remote api](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/remoteapi). You can package up your script and your file. Deploy them to an app engine instance and use remote api to kick of the script. I've never actually read a local file in GAE, but I would expect it to work.

    **NOTE** if you are planning to use NDB, you should take this route ^^.

2. Use a [compute engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/) instance. With a compute engine instance up and running, you can connect via SSH and run your script from there. 

    **NOTE** compute engine instances will cost more $$ if left running. Also, if you go the compute engine route, I would just use the Cloud Datastore APIs. 


It's hard to recommend one approach over the other without knowing what your plans are. If you want to ultimately serve this data, I'd definitely say use RemoteAPI / App Engine because you'll need to get familiar with it. If you just want it in DataStore to run queries against, I think maybe compute engine might be easier because it involves less proprietary technology.",2016-11-06 17:21:25+00:00,d9oc1tk,1.0,t3_5bg8i1,6818.0,googlecloud

4,"Before we all get too bent out of shape here, let's look at some facts and some prior art. 

**First off**, the restriction of *""static.tumblr.com""* and *""[yourblogname].tumblr.com""* is very telling. My guess is that they are not using wildcard cookies for authentication. Let's see ... yes, I can confirm that. **Next**, editing your blog cannot be done from your subdomain, but rather only from the `tumblr.com` domain.

**Conclusion:** This means while on `XXX.tumblr.com` not only can you not make AJAX calls to the tumblr backend (because of CORS restrictions), you do not even have a cookie for your authenticated session. This is critical to their design because your cookies aren't accessible when viewing any blogs which may or may not use JS. They, admittedly horribly, tried to explain this in their response using `window.alert(document.cookie)` as their example.

Okay prior art, Github. Github pages have this exact problem because they host static content for any repository. They quickly realized this problem and took steps to address it. Here: https://github.com/blog/1452-new-github-pages-domain-github-io . Read that carefully before responding with ""See github had `xxx.github.com` and switched to `xxx.github.io`"".

**Disclaimer:** I am not a security researcher and I do not use tumblr, so it is possible there is something I am overlooking. That said, I work on a web application that allows customers to have their own subdomain and has some of the very same security concerns. We've gone through several scrutinous security reviews, I've learned a lot from that. And what I see here indicates that this is not a relevant vulnerability, it's just how it has to work if they want to allow user provided JS.

First off, GCS and HPIS are awesome. HPIS (High Performance Image Service) is an on demand image manipulation service (scaling, cropping, rotating) that is also a CDN. People using S3 spend a lot of cycles or have to add on a 3rd party to do image scaling, and it's rarely on demand. With HPIS, you just tack `=w200h400` on the end of the URL and it crops. It also stores that cropped format in their CDN for faster serving next time. If you're building an app with a lot of image (e.g. pinterest/masonry), this is critical. 

Second, DataStore. DataStore is a highly scalable noSQL database that is similar to mongoDB. It's built on Google's MegaStore. It replicates production records across data centers and regions. Automatic redundancy for DR and other outages.

Lastly, AppEngine. For serving web requests and handling background workers, it doesn't get much better. App Engine's task queues and autoscaling make it really ease to scale up and down, across regions, as the traffic volumes change. No VMs, OS, complex routing configs, load balancing, etc to worry about. They have it all if you needed it, but App Engine out of the boxes makes it really easy for a **developer** to get an app up and serving.

49,"Honestly, I think AWS might be a better fit for that. AWS's EC2 is a bit more mature than GCP's Compute Engine. 

I've been using GCP for about 5 years now and I think the parts of GCP that really shine (their differentiators) are their services (GCS/HPIS, DataStore, BigQuery, PubSub, etc), as well as App Engine. 

Looking back at both, it seems like AWS started with ""infrastructure as a service"" and GCP started with ""platform as a service"". Since they've both moved toward the middle, but the point I was trying to make is that I think the infrastructure stuff (EC2) is just a bit more mature with AWS and the platform/service stuff is much more mature with GCP.

Lastly, I've actually heard of people, and actually know some, who have moved their enterprise software installations into AWS. I've never heard of this for GCP. I think you'll find better community support for this task with AWS. 

** Disclaimer: These are just my opinions. I probably don't even know what I'm talking about. :) Also, I do love GCP a lot. If you're building an app from the ground up, I think GCP's offerings are far better. Just trying to offer good perspective.

76,"GCP customer here. The primary parts of our stack includes: GAE (standard and flexible), Datastore and GCS [we love HPIS].

As I mentioned in my comment above, we love the newer ""Error Reporting"" offering. The heuristics for coalescing errors are really great. This is a home run feature, it just works, and works well.

Now for the areas to improve. 

**Logging**

I don't know if the log viewer is part of Stackdriver or it's just the branding / marketing weasels trying to be cute (because it's been around long before Google acquired Stackdriver). Either way, it's slow. Like really really slow. And the UI kind of clumsy. It's always reverting my filters when paging or apply new ones. Jumping to data ranges seems to cause versions / modules to reset. It's gotten a little better in recent months, but still needs work. Sometimes it gets so clunky I just punt and use Big Query as my log viewer. 

**Alerting / Monitoring**

The really needs improvement. The emails that are sent are so useless. I really like to see some remnants of the actual *errors* contained in the email. I'd like to not see the ""login with google"" link everytime I click the link in the email (I'm already logged in!). The granularity for triggering these alerts needs improved. More importantly, we need a way to identify known errors and have those emails be suppressed. While I understand this is not the direct goal of the monitoring function, we often get alert fatigue for transient errors. Like when datastore times out because the tablet server is hot. Or URLfetch is dragging ass. We get so many benign errors on the alerting that we mostly ignore it.

**Trace**

This is a really awesome feature with one major major downside. I cannot filter by partial URI or regex. It starts matching at the beginning of the URI. Here is a great example URI: `/api/v1/comment/XXXX/like` so I want to see all traces for the `.../like` endpoint. But I can't because there is an ID in there and no wild card matching. 

Sorry for the rants. I hope they don't come across too negative. We've been GCP users since 2010 and rarely get a chance to interface with PMs. And we have a lot of perspective and feedback.

91,"&gt; this is basically global vs local components which already exist, especially if using pods, and gets easier with the modules RFC.

Yeap, totally agree. But AFAIK the resolvers don't support local lookups yet. 

&gt; this would be much much more boilerplate 

I definitely don't agree with that. I think it's much easier for 15-20 components to talk directly to a service which has the state. Rather than passing around all of that state to various components. But we can agree to disagree.

&gt; This is just not true. This is exactly what yield and block params are for.

Okay, maybe I'm wrong here then. Let's consider this example:

    {{#my-widget user=user |widget|}}
      {{my-user-widget user=user}}
      &lt;button {{action widget.saveUser}}&gt;Save User&lt;/button&gt;
    {{/my-widget}}

My point was, and has been along, that because both `my-widget` and `my-user-widget` both require the user, it has to be passed into both components. Show me how to use `yield` and only pass `user=user` in once.

This is a very distilled down example. In our app, we have cases where components require 5-10 pieces of state passed into the block component and many of the sub components. That's the heart of what I'm trying to get at.",2016-05-31 17:09:16+00:00,d3qlcx6,7.0,t1_d3qki21,1153.0,emberjs
92,"I do know how to use yield. But it doesn't always solve the problem. `yield` is great if your problem is just passing through data. But when a component JS class actually needs to consume and transform data or fire the actions, it does nothing for you. You still end up with excess boilerplate. Additionally, if the component is used on several occasions, `yield` can it's self create more boilerplate because block form requires the redeclaration of child components.

e.g.

    {{#my-widget foo=foo hello=world user=user action=(action ""fireAction"") as |widget|}}
      {{widget.my-subwidget bar=bar}}
      &lt;div class=""somelayout""&gt;
        {{widget.my-subwidget bar=bar}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    {{/my-widget}}

In that example, even though I was able to pass `bar` to `my-subwidget` more easily and widget has yield it's component, the other aspects of the markup have to be duplicated upon each invocation of `my-widget`. So this really isn't perfect either.

I've never understand this micro-package mindset. It's one thing to use a small utility in your application. If the utility goes belly up, it's your responsibility to replace it.

111,"You're right that JS isn't the right tool for everything. You're wrong that Javascript isn't getting better.

First off, even though Javascript has been around for 20 years, I would argue that only in the last 6 years has it become viable as an application language. First, Node.js has only been around for 6 years, before that if you were using JS, you were writing code for the browser. Second, we didn't begin to see early MVC frameworks, like backbone, until about 6 years ago. Obviously DOM oriented frameworks like jQuery have been around a little longer (9 yrs). Lots of things beyond JS' control has held them back, namely browser runtime capabilities and network capabilities (remember you were shipping your code over dial up for some of that 20-year period). My point is that sizable application development in JS hasn't been around terribly long, thus the language hasn't had a reason to evolve for basically the first decade of it's life.

In the last two years we've seen a massive improvement in the language. Starting with ES6 and continuing into ES7. Transpilers like Babel are making it possible to take advantage of new language features not natively available in browser VMs. 

So while JS has been around for a while and it still may not be where other languages are in their lifecycles, to say it's not getting better is just flat wrong.",2016-03-26 12:53:34+00:00,d1e45i5,2.0,t1_d1d4dpy,75270.0,webdev

What I've gathered from some of the RFCs is that ember is targeting to really support and improve tagless components with AngleBrackets/GlimmerComponents. 

That said, I don't think tagless components were ever intended to be about performance. IMO tagless components are about more accessibility. There are many use cases for components beyond markup. One great example is what use to be `itemController`s. Another benefit of tagless components is making it easier to take markup from designers and integrate it into the application without adding markup for components.

Last week a co worker and I were looking out the window at the crack of dawn while making coffee from our second story office. Below was gated in area with a barbed wire fence. In the gated area were plenty of tools, trucks and other equipment as they had been working to redo the roof of our building, as well as some other restoration work. So a very sketchy looking van pulled up and 4 guys jumped out. At first they were just kind of looking around, but after about 5 minutes two of them climb the barbed wire fence and one of them is trying to break the lock with a hammer. Seems like a no brainer, call 911. By the time the cops had show up they had all climbed the fence and actually entered the top floor of the building through a latter. The cops didn't want to climb the ladder to talk to the guys, and since we had access to that floor (we are just tenants in the building), the cops said quote, ""It's probably fine, they're probably just construction guys getting an early start on the day. We're taking off."". 

So that was it, they just left. Never heard anything else about it. Never saw those guys again. An hour later the van was gone. ",2015-11-17 14:18:34+00:00,cx39vk8,1.0,t3_3t2z0s,54716.0,AskReddit

I went to public school in America, and I enjoy many of the subjects I learned (History, English, Math/Science). But using Math as an example, the way we were taught was about getting us to learn more things more quickly, not really for us to understand them. Often times teaching us overly complex ""shortcuts"" for solving math equations so we could ""get the answer"", but never really understand it. Then once you've passed that section of the course, you were more or less encouraged to just forget that and move on to the next thing.

I would say that if you know you're going to be a life long programmer / computer scientist learning C is a good way to start. It gives you understanding and appreciation for computer architecture down the road.

However, I've personally witnessed first time programmers struggling with C/C++ become completely turned off by it. In some cases, just giving up on programming altogether. I think for some people a higher language like python is a good choice. It allows them to get going quickly and build momentum as their project comes to life. They're not immediately bogged down by trying understand string terminators, memory allocs and wondering why the world they have to keep track separately of the number of items in an array.

* He increased tax on natural gas providers, because it made sense. They had such high subsidies.
