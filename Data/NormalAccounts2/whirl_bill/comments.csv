0,"Does anyone know if there are any mods out there that add decorative/nonfunctional/more defensive buildings?  I was looking for some stuff for a RP/PVP server to use, but I actually couldn't find anything.",2016-07-08 03:25:35+00:00,d53se9e,1,t3_4rimaz,134439,factorio
1,"Can't remember for the life of me.  Thanks for letting me know this!  I was hoping I could ""front-load"" some of the research for a multiplayer server I'll be hosting with a bunch of new players.",2016-06-20 19:18:29+00:00,d4h09b5,3,t1_d4gzzwq,334,factorio
2,"I saw recently in a Let's Play video that players in a multiplayer game don't actually share research.  Does anyone know how progressing research is handled?  I couldn't find anything on the wiki about it.

I would guess there are two ways to go about it.  Either all players get research benefits when any research station is active globally, or each research station is tied to a particular player somehow.  I can't see how the second one would be done, however.",2016-06-20 18:45:01+00:00,d4gypgg,1,t3_4o2sgk,520301,factorio
3,"Actually, the original title in Greek was The Politea, and the closest translation would be something along the lines of Political Organization or the Constitution (in American usage.)  When the Romans translated this work to Latin, they haphazardly tranlated politea to res publica, which means public affairs or politics (the bickery, horse-trade-y kind).

Then again, this is all coming out of a half-remembered Political Philosophy class.",2016-04-02 07:24:10+00:00,d1msaei,6,t1_d1mqcmk,6272,badhistory

8,"Always good to bring /u/anthropology_nerd into stuff like this,  he had a pretty good series of posts disputing the standard narrative of the Colombian Exchange.  Death by Disease Alone, I think it was called?  Anyways, my phone isn't letting me post links.

Also, this might be more /r/bad science territory, but can anyone tell me the accuracy of his definition of ""plague""?  It seems really weasely.",2015-11-24 17:34:55+00:00,cxbkuhd,1,t3_3u27uh,27991,badhistory
