I knew it f'd with my head. Two serious failed relationships later, 16 years later, today's the day I change it all. My last relationship failed because lack of interest. I wasn't interested in her, only my own perversions, newer weirder things found in porn. 

But a month ago, I finally met a girl I don't want to lose. She's the definition of the word perfect. Smart, very pretty, irresistibly feminine, humble, honest, and for some reason really likes me. 

The last 16 years of porn and jerking it have brought me absolutely nothing. I'm fucked up in the head, suffer from PIED, am constantly freaked out by being with a girl and not being able to perform because PIED. My first challenge just ended yesterday..went from March 30 to April 4. Lost out because I saw a super hot scantily clad girl on Instagram. Then wondered, ""might as well just take a quick gander at nsfw, just a quick look"". That didn't work. 

Resetting today, going for three weeks. Just those days, March 31-April 4 I felt much more confident and sure about myself. I'm pretty committed to kicking this worthless, destructive habit, for her. 

I'm reminded of the Einstein quote, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" If I don't change this, the same relationship cycle will take hold and I'll lose someone really valuable. I'm sure of it. It's a life with someone wonderful, or a life of worthless decrepit Internet-porn and my dick in my hand, lonely and lame.  

Onward to April 26th.",NoFap,"16 years later, finally in love, time for something to change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/4djt9h/16_years_later_finally_in_love_time_for_something/
