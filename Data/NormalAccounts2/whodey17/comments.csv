That’s a part of this process that people aren’t thinking about. Make sure whatever move you make doesn’t change what you can do in the future.”

92,"They'd much rather lose the few hardcore to illegal streams than even risk losing the casual viewer. The hardcore is never catered to for a reason. It never works out.  Why do you think Phil Simms still has a job on CBS? Because he connects to the lowest common viewer otherwise he'd be fired because he's a moron. Why do you think Chris Berman still does home run derby? It's not for his baseball knowledge. It's because he yells BACK BACK BACK BACK BACK and normal people at home eat that shit up. Why do you think Skip Bayless got paid more to move to Fox because casual viewers get riled up. They go to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and talk about what he said.  Hardcore intelligent sports fans realize he's full of shit.

A good example of that is WWE. They are currently catering to the hardcore viewers and giving them the champions and contenders they want and they are in the midst of having the lowest ratings in almost 20 years. Sure everyone on the internet is happy for the most part but the people who drive the ratings aren't watching which is a problem. ",2016-09-22 14:47:58+00:00,d7xhtzp,6,t1_d7xh17h,1069,MLS
93,"Doesnt matter. Fox is a TV network who's only goal is to draw more viewers in order to sell more advertising at the lowest possible cost to them.  

I understand what you're saying but you don't gain more viewers by putting on a matchup with 2 teams 9 out of 10 Americans have never heard of.   If they get 100 extra people to watch the game based on putting on Man U (Hey isn't that the team that Beckham dude played for before coming to the US?) then those 100 people tell their friends ""Hey I watched a soccer game with Manchester United and it was almost kind of interesting""

There is literally 0 draw to Tottenham and Monaco. Hell most people can't even tell where Monaco is located so there is no connection to draw people in. There has to be some kind of narrative because you're right not many people watch soccer at 245 on a Tuesday. More people are more likely to tune in and watch the big players (Man U, Barca, Real M, Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern) than Tottenham at Monaco. So they'll always put them on.

TV Stations will never dictate to the hardcore or most knowledgeable because that's the best way to drive away your casual viewer which drives your ratings. I could put any number of shit games on and you'll still watch. But if I lose that guy who only tunes in expecting big games with big teams and big names I'm fucked.

You don't get rewarded for using the same doctor or dentist for years. They bill you just the same. Energy prices go up. Credit cards may lower your interest rate. Movie theater prices go up. Theme park prices go up. Subway will give you a free sub after so many purchases so there is that.

You may want to download an app for your phone to block the number. 

They will have to serve you and likely your mother so one of you will get it for sure. The suit will be served by mail or by sheriff. 

Every state operates differently. It may bounce around for 6 months or it may bounce around for 5 years. There is no real way to know.  Your state has a statute of limitations for promissory notes.

If you can get tickets when they go on sale then those prices will obviously go down as you'll get them at the normal price. Ticketmaster sucks though so I wouldn't bank on that. ",2016-03-21 19:05:54+00:00,d186h7z,3,t1_d184xwr,2045,SquaredCircle

If these are federal loans the government will attempt to set up a garnishment and will receive nothing and they'll hold your tax return (if you have one).  Seeing as you'll have 0 income and 0 returns I'm assuming your credit gets fucked and if you ever get a job again the government will just immediately start garnishing

If these are private loans then they'll go through the process of debt collectors and then eventually suing you.  Once they file suit and get a judgement (if you dont fight it) then they will have the ability to garnish your wages, place liens on your property, tax returns.  Now if you're in a community property state this applies to your wife too as you're married so all property is seen as owned by both. They can place leins on anything she owns also.

903,"/u/3dubs is correct. You want to live in Oakley.  

1.  You'll want to be in Oakley/Hyde Park. Especially having a car and stuff.  Oakely is extremely walkable for dinner and such.  You'll still probably need to get in your car to drive to the store.  (cincinnati in general is not a very walkable city).   Downtown is another option as it is far more walkable but it's just not as safe as Oakley.  (Not to say your car is going to get broken into weekly or you're going to get mugged downtown but comparing apples to apples it is less safe).

2. I go to Fitworks in Norwood.  It's $10 a month. its about a 5 minute drive from Oakley.  There is also an LA Fitness in Oakley. 

3.  Oakley has a pretty good bar scene.  Mt. Lookout is a neighborhood over and they have a nice little square.  Downtown has the Banks and OTR. The former was just built and the latter is undergoing a renaissance of sorts.  Cincinnati Sports Leagues will allow you to sign up as a single player and they'll place you on a team. That may help you meet people.  There is also a trivia website somewhere but I don't know what it is. ",2015-06-16 18:13:09+00:00,cs8m780,1,t3_3a228m,4646,cincinnati
