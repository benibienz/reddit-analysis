28,2016-02-10 14:59:33+00:00,self.nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/4532ud/new_concussion_test/,False,"So as a WWE fan I've been following along with the Daniel Bryan retirement/saga.  On ESPN last night he revealed some pretty scary stuff which is probably relevant to some NFL players.


&gt; 
Bryan says they have ten documented concussions, but it’s impossible to define each one. Coach then asks about how Bryan found out about his career being over, and Bryan says he went to New York for some EEG tests, and this one measured electrical brain activity while doing reflex testing. Bryan says it’s a newer form of the test, but he wanted evidence to support his petition to come back to wrestling. Bryan says his other EEG and MRI test were great, but this one showed he had some slowing, and evidence of “a small or subacute or chronic lesions” in the area of his brain that causes seizures. Bryan says he has had post-concussion seizures that he hid and it was unknown why, but now they found out something to link the symptoms. 
&gt; 

So I view the main parts as one hiding concussions and symptoms which I have no doubt goes on inside of the NFL. The other part was that he took a new test that not only tests reflexes but brain activity as well.  I'm curious to if any NFL players have taken this test and why it's not mandatory. If the NFL really cares about player safety (which they say but I don't believe) they would have each player take this test to determine the severity of any brain damage (if any). 

Now I dont know the exact test he took or with who so we can't say the science of that particular test and doctors/team are well respected in the science community. Overall I still think the players should take the test and in the end I think it would drastically change the sports landscape for all contact sports.
