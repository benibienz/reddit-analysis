The awesome MaÃ«lle Salmon used the rtweet R package to extract thousands of #firstsevenjob and #first7jobs tweets, used MonkeyLearn for the analysis and ggplot2 for creating the visualizations.

I don't remember exactly the cost of Mturk, but I believe it was something like USD 100-200? Cheers",2016-07-20 21:43:04+00:00,d5k4s0d,2,t1_d5k3j3n,1676,MachineLearning
11,"Hey! Glad that you liked it! The scraping bit was fast, it took a few hours maybe? We also believe that we only scratched the surface here, we think there are a lot more interesting and deeper insights within this dataset + machine learning analysis! For the moment, we don't have any plans for further analysis of this data, but this one of the reasons we shared the source code, so anyone can continue and extend the analysis.

13,Hey /r/DataIsBeautiful! We made some pretty interesting visualizations analyzing +1 million hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. In the post we went through how we got the data and how we made the visualization using Kibana. We shared the source code so you can make your own analysis.
