8,"My favorite story from the article: 

&gt; In recent decades, advances in technology, engineering, and robotics have made it easier to observe nature and borrow from it with more precision than ever before. In the early 2000s, Japan Railways Group, which operates the Shinkansen bullet train, asked one of its engineers, Eiji Nakatsu, to come up with a way to fix a longstanding problem. Whenever the train went through a narrow tunnel at high speed, the atmospheric pressure created low-frequency waves that spread out from the tunnel and created vibrations in the air. These vibrations were so powerful that residents 400 metres away from the railway line wrote in to complain about the noise.
&gt; 
&gt; Nakatsu, who is a keen birdwatcher, wondered if his weekend hobby might provide him with ideas for how to deal with sudden changes in air resistance. His mind turned to the kingfisher, a bird whose long and flat beak allows it to dive from the air (low resistance) into water (high resistance), with a minimal amount of disturbance so as not to alert its prey. Nakatsu redesigned the nose of the Shinkansen 500-Series, making it longer and flatter. The new design successfully reduced air pressure by 30%.",2016-10-26 17:39:22+00:00,d98rxmi,1.0,t3_59iwd3,45.0,medicine

16,"&gt; But they could. I'm not saying Panpsychism is true, I'm saying it hasn't failed (at least not yet), like this article claims.

I agree, and I don't think he claims that panpsychism is untrue. He just says that he's not placing his bets on the idea, for reasons I think are pretty good. 

&gt; It claims that for the reasons noted above this kind of model can never work.

18,"&gt; If the critique of panpsychism works just as well as a critique of the atomic model

19,"&gt; What about the time before we understood atoms and molecules? Does that mean that atomic theory couldn't be true just because we didn't understand it?

I don't think the author intended this to be a reason we should throw panpsychism out. He prefaces it with ""of course, there are problems with panpsychism."" So I think he was just explaining some of the challenges. 

It also builds up to his later argument that panpsychism sort of takes a shortcut by reducing consciousness to something fundamentally metaphysical rather than actually explaining it. This is a possibility, for sure, but those kinds of steps should be avoided in science. It reminds me of Imre Lakatos' idea that when the ""core"" of a research program (or ""paradigm"") needs a bunch of ad hoc explanations in the ""outer belt,"" the core starts to degrade and get weaker in explanatory power. 

That's actually the REASON I find much of physics (quantum physics, string theory, etc.) to be weak nowadays, and why I think we could very well see another scientific revolution soon, or else we've reached what Horgan called ""the end of science"" in a book by the same name. 

So this critique, I think, is pretty justifiable, although the alternative proposed isn't too helpful. It isn't even a good defense of the reductionist materialist idea I think he's arguing for.",2016-09-28 19:10:49+00:00,d85w729,2.0,t1_d85vprx,565.0,philosophy

29,"Some things to keep in mind, taken [from Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12474222) (not all of it is quite correct, but they're important clarifications): 

&gt; There are a few issues i can see here.
&gt;
&gt; 1. (meta-science) If this result mattered, it would be published in the Journal of the Acoustical Society (JASA), which is where all the good marine mammal acoustics work is published. This appears to be a private journal of a particular russian university, which is less than convincing, and single-author papers are always (fairly or unfairly) subject to higher scrutiny. Other weirdnesses: the paper was submitted on 16 AUG, accepted the same day, and ""reviewed"" within 5 days. This suggests a certain laxity of rigor.
&gt;
&gt; 2. This work was done in a small highly reverberant concrete-walled pool. It would be more convincing in free-field, as much of the analysis here is tightly coupled to notions of coherency, which reverberations blow right (so to speak) out of the water. Why their analysis is done in pascals SPL and not dB re 1uPa SPL (as everyone else does) is confusing.
&gt;
&gt; 3. There is little to no quantitative analysis of spectral features in the results or discussion. There are also multiple sentences that involve the phrase ""we can assume"", which I would argue is certainly not the case.
&gt;
&gt; 4. That dolphin clicks are spectrotemporally complex is a boring result. The authors fail to demonstrate, and in fact basically don't even claim, the assertion in the HN title.",2016-09-12 02:31:37+00:00,d7j2ik1,1.0,t3_52c5uu,72.0,science

66,"Like with many things in philosophy, it depends on the definition. If you are talking about the ""libertarian"" notion of free will, or the idea that an ""I"" is the sole cause of your actions, you have to account for something other than our biological, material being, and that's just not tenable. Libertarian notions have basically been dismissed by findings in neuroscience and evolutionary biology. For example, we know that our brain makes decisions up to 10 seconds before we become aware of them. It also doesn't make practical sense from a materialist perspective. Our decisions are always caused by something else. 

However, many people say that ""free will"" refers to necessary conditions for moral responsibility (e.g., Daniel Dennett). For example, one might argue that a person who kills another human being because he's angry with them has committed a crime that is worthy of punishment. But if it is known that the person has a mental illness, we might say there is a little less moral responsibility inherent in his decision and that we should therefore be more lenient or go with an entirely different punishment. Note, however, that the decision is still caused by something else. 

Personally, I agree with the people who argue that so long as we remain in our current society, free will is an outdated concept that we would do better off without (e.g., Sam Harris). We don't need an idea like free will to punish a guy who murders someone --- regardless of the cause or external pressure, if he's likely to kill again, he's a danger to society and should be dealt with accordingly. On the other hand, if he was forced into committing some atrocious act by extreme environmental pressures (e.g., torture, authoritarian government, etc.) then there is room for more compassion, and again this isn't something we need the concept of free will acknowledge. Also, by transitioning from a language that implicitly accepts libertarian notions of free will (like ""responsibility"") we recognize the full complexity of the situation: that a person is a bundle of causes and effects, just like any other material being, and our analysis of that person's behaviors is a question of social and personal goals, not punishment or vengeance. Recognizing this makes for more effective solutions, like putting a person through circumstances that compel him to change his mind. 

(EDIT: I should note that I'm not actually a fan of this outcome in reality, just in the abstract, if I accept that our current society is a given. In reality I think that our society, for many of the above reasons, is on the path to an Orwellian future that I want no part in.)

But the bottom line is that as far as science can tell us so far, there is no extra-natural / extra-material thing that makes decisions for human beings. Just like with all other creatures, our decisions are caused by something else, which is caused by something else, which eventually has its origins in the big bang. And even if quantum theory, for instance, proves this strict version of determinism wrong, we still have a problem of free will because it precludes ""random"" causes and requires that the ""I"" is the *only* originator of whatever decision is in question.

&gt; In 18th-century America, colonial society and Native American society sat side by side. The former was buddingly commercial; the latter was communal and tribal. As time went by, the settlers from Europe noticed something: No Indians were defecting to join colonial society, but many whites were defecting to live in the Native American one.
&gt;
&gt; This struck them as strange. Colonial society was richer and more advanced. And yet people were voting with their feet the other way.
&gt;
&gt; The colonials occasionally tried to welcome Native American children into their midst, but they couldn’t persuade them to stay. Benjamin Franklin observed the phenomenon in 1753, writing, “When an Indian child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian ramble with them, there is no persuading him ever to return.”
&gt;
&gt; During the wars with the Indians, many European settlers were taken prisoner and held within Indian tribes. After a while, they had plenty of chances to escape and return, and yet they did not. In fact, when they were “rescued,” they fled and hid from their rescuers.
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes the Indians tried to forcibly return the colonials in a prisoner swap, and still the colonials refused to go. In one case, the Shawanese Indians were compelled to tie up some European women in order to ship them back. After they were returned, the women escaped the colonial towns and ran back to the Indians.
&gt;
&gt; Even as late as 1782, the pattern was still going strong. Hector de Crèvecoeur wrote, “Thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of those aborigines having from choice become European.”

And Joseph Tainter mentions the in some sense voluntary simplification of the Byzantine empire. However, he acknowledges that this was more a response to circumstances than a fully voluntary ""choice.""",2016-08-20 02:15:29+00:00,d6owrfr,,t1_d6niptt,86451.0,DebateAnarchism

That's NOT a reason to deny the Holocaust. It may leave the room open for making Hitler ""less of a bad guy,"" but I don't think that argument has much strength. Most people I have known who have made a radical turn toward the fascist right do so because they feel they have somehow been lied to. The Holocaust, they say, has been propped up as worse than it really was, or something like this. This kind of perception is only exacerbated when we deny the facts of the matter, or gloss them over, or respond to them in a knee jerk manner, afraid that it will help Holocaust deniers justify their message. That's simply not a correct perception of how people are radicalized. They're radicalized not because of the facts, but because they start to sense a conspiracy when they've never heard those facts before. 

The claim that there is no definitive proof that Hitler knew about the Holocaust is completely compatible with the fact that there was a Holocaust. The latter claim is, in fact, undeniable. We should work to make it clear that that is as far as our knowledge goes at this point.

85,"&gt; But you're saying that concern for our loved ones is a human universal; so how do we abandon this concern on a social level?

I don't think we will so long as we remain biological. Like I said, what is required is a material change in our condition, and that can occur through mistakes, social systems collapsing from the weight of their own problems, natural disasters, or irrational time periods like we've seen through various revolutions. Not everyone feels loyalty to their family, some don't have ties, etc. Should one or more of these things occur and material changes be instituted that are hard to undo in any reasonable amount of time, we'll come to more or less accept our condition, or the whole process will start again and take a few more centuries or millenia before we have to grapple with the question again. But this is all very, very hypothetical, which brings me to your next question. 

&gt; It seems to me that your philosophy is essentially a sort of dark utopianism; an eschatological belief. Am I right in thinking the 'collapse' is something you anticipate?

It could happen. It is not a cornerstone of the philosophy. Like I said, wildism is a moral philosophy that deals with a single ethical question regarding our relationship to nature, including human nature. This means that it is applicable now. The future is a secondary concern, although still an important one, more the near future than the far future, like with all moral philosophies. 

I personally don't hold much hope of a global collapse caused by human beings. I think that's wildly unrealistic. I don't think a collapse caused by the usual civilizational problems or by natural disasters is unthinkable, but that's outside of our control. It also may not even solve a lot of the problems that we are talking about; we could be dead wrong. But at least right now, I know that I value a relationship with the world we have found, rather than made, that is defined by wildness, and I hope to defend the places where that is still the norm, restore aspects of our life where it has been lost, and possibly even more where that is possible. I don't much like apocalyptic narratives. As you said, there's a certain eschatological air to them, but I'm not promising a better future, even if what I perceive as being a beneficial event occurs. I'm saying that if we value these things, we should act on them and we should not condemn those who act on them radically, especially given our current situation, where the values are disregarded so openly and forcefully. But humans have made mistakes in the past, and this could very well be another instance of that. 

&gt; You have said you have no real interest convincing people of the merits of your philosophy on a mass basis, or of forming any mass movement...

Well, I've said I don't think it's possible, and it's not where I'm putting my energy. I think there will be mass movements that organized groups could exploit. I really doubt that a mass movement will be formed around these ideas specifically. Should that occur, we'll use the opportunity, though. Or at least I and some others I know will. It just seems unlikely. 

&gt; so how do you hope to navigate this period of crisis?

Act according to your values, to give a general answer. More specifically, I suggest techniques like those outlined in *[The Organizational Weapon](http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R201.html)* by Philip Selznick. There shouldn't be any expectation that a greater collapse will come. The intent should be acting in line with our values and where possible trying to institute lasting changes on that front. For example, I've mentioned elsewhere that riots can discourage development. These become much more frequent and realistic in periods of general social turmoil. Also, at least outside of the US, it seems like some other methods are possible. For example, greenhouse gas emissions seem to have drastically decreased in places where there is major social turmoil, like Syria. It's also harder for prevailing powers to surveil these areas. I wouldn't say this is unequivocally a good thing, but if we find ourselves in such a situation it is at least an option for us to engage in a way that extends it. 
 
I mean, really right now there are many crises we could exploit, and they're much more relevant. Think about the unrest caused by people's knowledge of mass surveillance. Or economic turmoil facing some small cities in industrial nations. Or the vacuums frequently created by natural disasters or pandemics. These are all opportunities that small groups could easily take advantage of. If wildism grows this becomes even more useful to recognize. As it stands, though, it seems like wildists are too small a group, and should stick to moderate approaches, public advocacy or support of other approaches, and some other things that I'm sure someone who puts their mind to it could figure out. 

&gt; Do you imagine that, at a crucial point, ideas that are compatible with yours will naturally emerge and reach some tipping point of mass consciousness in a 'revolutionary time period'?

I think the above basically answers this question. To be explicit: I don't think it's likely. ",2016-08-17 11:22:03+00:00,d6kzd4b,,t1_d6kysk7,1647.0,DebateAnarchism

87,"&gt; do you think that in terms of the individual experience, previous civilisations offered some improvement over our own? 

When we're talking about improvement we're talking about values, so the answers will be relative. Personally, I think earlier civilizations are better than this one in the on respect that wildist philosophy addresses: wildness. They simply didn't have as much control over nature, including human nature. 

&gt; what do you think it is particularly about civilisation since the industrial revolution that seem to have given rise to the variety of anti-civilisation ideas on display?

The extent to which it dominates nature is a huge factor, though not the only one. Never before have we been asked to care for all of humanity and had that backed up consistently with force, for instance. I think a lot of this is addressed in [FC's manifesto](http://wildism.org/rca/items/show/13). Also, non-human nature has been destroyed at an alarming rate, especially in early industrial society, and that's bothersome to a lot of people. 

Other unrelated concerns have to do with things like the media. For example, although the world seems to be getting less violent, constant media reports of violence cause a lot of anxiety and general dissatisfaction with modernity. And as Marxists have pointed out, the different relationships around labor are pretty jarring to human beings. Basically, in general changes are happening so fast that things we had to deal with every few generations are becoming a problem for every generation, like major changes in social values. I think that contributes a lot to anti-civilization sentiments, even though factually they don't withstand scrutiny in all cases. 

&gt; How do you perceive the ill and the disabled?

We regard them as every other person. I care deeply for my disabled family members or friends with chronic health problems. Their illnesses don't really affect how I value them. 

&gt; Would your wildist philosophy see suffering, death and/or euthanasia as preferable to becoming beholden in some way to medical technology?

Well, when we're talking about ""wildness"" and ""industry"" and ""hunter/gatherers"" we're talking on a social scale, not a personal one. And our reasons for wanting these things don't have to do with negative views of people with subpar health. I suppose someone could feasibly hold that viewpoint and still accept everything else about wildism, but I'd not be very happy with them if they expressed this to me in conversation, for instance. 

Medicine is here. Use it if you have to to survive. I know a few people who wouldn't because they don't value their lives over what they see as the dignity of living independently of biomedical technics. For instance, a friend's grandfather refused chemo because he saw that whole process as degrading. But I think most people's concern for life and the happiness of their families trumps their concern for wildness, and I don't think that'll change any time soon. That's why a lot of these changes will have to occur on a social scale. For example, like I said (in another comment, I think), people's normal inhibitions don't often apply in revolutionary time periods, so for that period of time they'll do things they wouldn't have before and probably won't after. Like destroy electric substations. That makes a lot of these biomedical questions irrelevant because after that you can't use life-support without electricity. But it probably won't be a direct hit to medical infrastructure, which I think most humans would find repulsive. Of course, that may nevertheless be what occurs in an indirect sense. If this whole regional stability thing even happens. 

We shouldn't dance around this question, either: many people who survive in industrial societies don't survive in regions without industry. That's simply a fact. I've already addressed how some of these changes could occur without addressing that problem directly, but afterwards, do I think we'll try to rebuild a lot of this infrastructure for the sole purpose of restoring life expectancies of people with these issues? Not to a degree that would be threatening to the overall project. We have to remember that when death is just a fact of life, people simply accept it. It's like that in places with high infant mortality, and it's that way now with, for example, miscarriages, which are much more common than we admit but which aren't seen as a huge problem because technics haven't demonstrated that they are preventable. And in many cultures, there were mores or practices that explicitly condemned some less fit members to death. Mothers in many traditional societies will kill babies with extremely debilitating defects. It's just not worth the time and energy for them when later on, the same baby won't help find/produce food or take care of the parents when they're older. Those sorts of practices inevitably arise in less comfortable conditions. And no, we aren't going to rationally trade one for the other. The natural human desires for life, parental investment in their offspring, etc. are too strong. 

&gt; The modification of form and mind doesn't necessarily preclude such things though; it's not an either/or situation.

Yeah, that's why these sorts of things have to all come together and converge on a value like ""wildness."" Alone they aren't very powerful. 

&gt; At what point would you say the cyborg stops being human?

Oh I have no clue. It's a hard question. There's a good movie that prompts this kind of discussion, *The Bicentennial Man*. Great movie, has Robin Williams, and the premise is that a very smart robot figures out a way to make robotic counterparts to human organs, and he ends up being essentially human. I think you'd really like it, given your interests. 

It's a complicated philosophical question that I don't know has a satisfying answer right now. All I can say is what I tend towards. I tend to value humanness. I know what kinds of changes to resist if I'm to act in line with that value. But I can't be sure of exact cut off points or anything like that.

89,"On civilization as concept vs. specific civilizations: 

If you're trying to argue for the legitimacy of the idea of civilization, then I don't have any argument against that except for my own values, which you either accept or don't. But if we are talking about specific civilizations, then I would point out that this period of history is unprecendented in that a collapse, if it occurs, would be global, so some of the earlier rules don't apply. This is why people like Martin Rees, in *Our Final Hour*, and Ronald Wright, in *A Short History of Progress*, regard the threat of collapse as one of the more serious threats we are currently facing. (Well, ""threat"" if you want to preserve it.)

&gt; Furthermore, the abandonment of a civilised way of life has never, to our knowledge, been voluntary. 

Yeah it's hard to see how it could be, and I don't think it will be that way this go around. It is possible that small regions could be overtaken with a revolutionary fervor that results in people destroying the basic infrastructure of their civilization. But it's unknown at this point whether that will ever occur, and long-term rational thinking (""if I get rid of this electric substation, then civilization will collapse!"") probably won't be part of it. For example, people did all sorts of irrational things during the French Revolution, but a lot of that was because of material conditions relating to famine or unrest over the inert political elite. If a comparable situation arises, the question won't be whether the masses will as a whole voluntarily rid themselves of civilization, but whether organized groups with a radical agenda can take advantage of the unrest and, at least in some ways, channel it to benefit their goals. Consider, for example, the unemployment that will come with this new wave of automation. Don't you think people will be angry enough to destroy some machines?

&gt; Do you think that previous civilisations kept some sort of balance that our current civilisation lacks?

No, no. Civilizations as a whole generally tend toward growth. Some agricultural civilizations seem to remain relatively stagnant over long (but historically short) time periods, but for the most part balance isn't really inherent in civilized life. In fact, the Pleistocene extinction event and other such things suggest that balance hasn't been a part of any human society. 

&gt; What importance, if any, do you place on the idea that people remain 'essentially human' in some way? What is it, if anything, about the human experience you find valuable?

Oh! Wow, I got your question totally wrong. So there are a couple of different ways to answer this question, so understand that ""wildness"" is valued in two ways. Some wildists see wildness as valuable in itself, and other things that relate to it are just supporting, subsidiary values. Other times, wildists value lots of different things that altogether converge to create a rational ideal of ""wildness."" For example, if I value my and my own's autonomy from larger systems; if I value wilderness areas; and if I value spontaneity in life, I can put all these together and say that ""wildness"" sort of encapsulates all of them. So when it comes to human nature, some of us will just say, ""well I like being human more than I like the cyborg alternatives, so much as I can tell at this time."" And that's the end of it. Humanness is valuable in itself. 

But if I was to list some of the subsidiary values I see in keeping human nature, I'd list some of these things: 

* Lots of transhumanist ideas center ""consciousness,"" but that's not all there is to a human being. Other things, like irrational emotions and physicality, are also valuable. 

* I value the physicality of my human form. The blood, the pain, the comfortable feeling of a soft blanket, etc. All of this is pretty nice, you know? 

* Human limits are often what gives value to our quests to stretch those limits. For example, there's the question of biological modification in sports ethics. It's actually a pretty big question nowadays, and [The Hastings Center](http://www.thehastingscenter.org/briefingbook/chapter-33-sports-enhancement/) has written some good stuff on it. Naturally, sports are an interesting quest to test human limits. But when the technical component begins to dominate, it eventually turns into something different altogether --- a feat of engineering more than anything else. You might say this is valuable, and I don't necessarily disagree. But it is at the least differently valuable. 

* There's usually a trust or a faith in natural order. It's similar to the conservative position that sees wisdom in long-standing social structures, and that is therefore skeptical of revolutionary changes that claim to be improvements. Maybe we just don't know as much as we'd like to think. For example, a not-often-talked-about problem of modern civilization is dysgenics (and it's not mentioned often because it does have eugenical overtones, so be weary of some of the stuff out there on it), a side-effect of our current medical apparatus. This only becomes a bigger problem when we introduce biotechnics. 

There may be some other stuff, but I'm interested in how you'll respond to what I've just written. Maybe I can take it in a more interesting direction for you if you think I've mentioned a bunch of irrelevant stuff. ",2016-08-17 06:12:31+00:00,d6kt76r,,t1_d6ksgwo,1769.0,DebateAnarchism
90,"Okay, my bad if you feel like I put words in your mouth. The only point I insist on is that your notion of ""flux"" invalidates the Idea of Progress insofar as it means ""civilization has improved, is improving, and **will improve** the human condition."" It's an argument against the future. If civilizations collapse, then it can't keep improving the human condition. 

&gt; what value, if any, do you place on individual humanity? 

Can you ask the question a different way? I don't understand what you are asking. 

If you are asking what I think you are asking, I'd answer it this way: We value the wildness of the individual and his own --- his ""own"" meaning relationships with friends, family, environment, etc. --- over larger systems and organizations. So if, for example, a state demands that certain groups sacrifice their in-group loyalty for the sake of the state's stability, we will challenge that imperative. But, conversely, it also means that if the UN demands we put effort into bringing justice everywhere, we also challenge that. This is an attempt to extend, channel, modify, or distort the altruism inherent in human nature. You no doubt view this as legitimate. But it sacrifices our autonomy for the sake of a larger system that we simply feel no loyalty towards. Ellul writes about this in *The Technological Society* (there are typos because I copied and pasted from a scanned PDF):

&gt; At the same time ( and this is the second factor which made for the plasticity of the social milieu ) a systematic campaign was waged against all natural groups, under the guise of a defense of the rights of the individual; for example, the guilds, the communes, and federalism were attacked, this last by the Girondists. There were movements against the religiOUS orders and against the privileges of Parliament, the Universities, and the Hospitalers. There was to be no liberty of groups, only that of the individual. There was likewise a struggle to undermine the family. Revolutionary legislation promoted its disintegration; it had already been shaken by the philosophy and the fervors of the eighteenth century. Revolutionary laws governing divorce, inheritance, and paternal authority were disastrous for the family unit, to the benefit of the individual. And these effects were permanent, in spite of temporary setbacks. Society was already atomized and would be atomized more and more. The individual remained the sole SOciological unit, but, far from assuring him freedom, this fact provoked the worst
kind of slavery. 
&gt;
&gt; The atomization we have been discussing conferred on society the greatest possible plasticity-a decisive condition for technique. The breakup of social groups engendered the enonnous displacement of people at the beginning of the nineteenth century and resulted in the concentration of population demanded by modem technique. To uproot men from their surroundings, from the rural districts and from family and friends, in order to crowd them into
cities still too small for them; to squeeze thousands into unfit lodgings and unhealthy places of work; to create a whole new environment within the framework of a new human condition ( it is too often overlooked that the proletariat is the creation of the industrial machine )-all this was possible only when the individual was completely isolated. It was conceivable only when he literally had no environment, no family, and was not part of a group able to resist economic pressure; when he had almost no way of life left. 
&gt;
&gt; Such is the influence of social plasticity. Without it, no technical evolution is pOSSible. For the individual in an atomized society, only the state was left: the state was the highest authority and it became omnipotent as well. The SOCiety produced was perfectly malleable and remarkably flexible from both the intellectual and the material points of view. The technical phenomenon had its most favorable environment since the beginning of history. 

Joseph Tainter [points out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI) that complexity ""simplifies and channels human behavior"" (6:39). 

Peter Singer writes a whole book on how technical developments have expanded natural altruism to a larger circle, first from the band, then the tribe, then the nation, eventually to humanity, maybe one day to animals. See *The Expanding Circle*.

And many have noticed that the tendency of humans to favor their own is a hard problem for current social structures. See Joshua Greene's *Moral Tribes* and Sebastian Junger's *Tribes*. 

So to favor the cohesiveness of one's own group over the cohesiveness of these larger systems puts us in conflict with them. It is a concern related to the wildist concern for wildness. ",2016-08-17 05:18:18+00:00,d6krsvu,,t1_d6h42w8,,DebateAnarchism
91,"Hey /u/sra3fk, these are excellent questions. Thanks for asking them. 

Insofar as there is a connection between agriculture and hierarchy, it is a secondary or sometimes even an irrelevant point to wildists. It's really only something that primitivists bring up as important to their values. Wildists don't say anything explicitly about hierarchy. That doesn't mean you can't dislike hierarchy AND hold the wildist philosophy. But wildism is concerned about one question: the relationship we should have toward nature, including human nature. If it is in our nature to be hierarchical (which it doesn't seem to be, but that is a scientific question), then there you are. Scientifically we can say something about that, but the claims aren't wildist's core concern. 

So then we are concerned with the following question when it comes to agriculture: how much power does that mode of production give a society over nature? 

We recognize that it grants quite a bit of power over the nomadic hunter/gatherer mode of production. So we reject it for similar reasons the US founding fathers espoused a checks and balances system. Not every autocracy definitively mistreated the populace over which it ruled. But this was an inherently unstable balance. It was dependent on the whim of the rulers, the elite class. It was the difference between true freedom and simple permissiveness. As FC put it in their infamous manifesto: 

&gt; 94. By ""freedom"" we mean the opportunity to go through the power process, with real goals not the artificial goals of surrogate activities, and without interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone, especially from any large organization. Freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a member of a small group) of the life-and-death issues of one’s existence: food, clothing, shelter and defense against whatever threats there may be in one’s environment. Freedom means having power; not the power to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one’s own life. One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how benevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72).

Espousing the nomadic hunter/gatherer mode of production as a social ideal is similar to this. As I put it in a response to a letter when I was still the editor of *The Wildernist*: 

&gt; I like to compare the nomadic hunter-gatherer ideal, then, to the ingenious system of checks and balances devised by the American Revolutionaries, who had a similar view of human nature. The whole idea is that while humans certainly have the _capacity_ to do good, only hard limits built into the system could assure it with any reasonable stability. For the revolutionaries, checks and balances were devised to counter political corruption. In a much more reliable manner, the hunter-gatherer mode of production would place a pretty hard material limit on the amount of control humans could have over Nature. Thus, the ideal isn’t a veneration of nomadic hunter-gatherer life as much as it is a rational suggestion of what mode of production would be most likely to result in positive human-Nature interactions. Of course, Atticus (the other editor) and I, and our friends over at The Wildist Network [now Wild Will], don’t suggest the nomadic hunter-gatherer way of life as a practical goal, but as a moral ideal, well, there it is.

You mention that agriculture is essential to sustaining the current population. This is irrefutably true. However, our program does not rely on the appearance of a magical button that we can press and then make everything disappear. That simply won't occur. There will be no magical button, nor will there be a realistic counterpart. Even if there were, wildist philosophy would not be able to answer the question about whether to press it, because the moral questions that one then has to consider are outside of its scope. 

For example, there is a limitation to human moral reasoning when it comes to large populations, well known in population ethics. Patricia Churchland explains: ""no one has the slightest idea how to compare the mild headache of five million against the broken legs of two, or the needs of one’s own two children against the needs of a hundred unrelated brain-damaged children in Serbia."" 

We might also consider the findings of Paul Slovic. I write: 

&gt; For example, Slovic (2007) once conducted an experiment in which he told volunteers about a starving girl, measured their willingness to donate, and then told the same story to another group but with the added detail that millions of others were also starving. The second group gave around half as much money as the first. In fact, Slovic found that even adding just one more person would begin the process of “psychic numbing.”

These are all questions that wildist philosophy has no answers for. But in our current moment, facing our current conditions, and knowing our current limitations, we do know that we care for some things that are being destroyed. It only makes sense to act on these values. The conventional response to this is well-respected: conservation. But part of WW's work is explaining that more extreme approaches are legitimate, both in terms of our own values, and even in terms of conventional values. It is generally accepted that moderate beliefs can legitimately transition into radical ones if the grievances in question are not sufficiently addressed. I can't think of any situation where this applies as thoroughly as in conservation. So, I argue, the move from conservation to reaction isn't that crazy, and is in fact a duty for anyone who cares for wild nature and is willing and able to take it on. 

I can't prescribe the specifics, for legal reasons and for practical ones. But I'll try to outline some suggestions. 

First, we _should_ make lifestyle choices that reduce our dependence on industry (primitive skills events, survivalist events, identifying plants, gardening, etc).

Second, we should support moderate approaches to conservation. There's quite a bit of wild nature still left to conserve. For example, most countries have wilderness reserve systems. If we are serious about our concern for wild nature, it only makes sense to take steps to preserve them. 

Third, we should support more radical approaches to conservation, like those espoused by The Wildlands Network. For example, in North America they focus on restoring connections between wildlands especially in areas they've identified as important to deal with climate change, the extinction crisis, and ecosystems that have lost their top predators. Work is currently being done to apply a similar approach in other regions of the world. If you are a scientist, helping that work is one of the best possible things you could do. 

Fourth, we should support even more radical approaches to conservation. For instance, if a riot occurs in an urbanized region that has been identified as crucial for the wildlife corridors and megalinkages mentioned above, then we should recognize this as useful for the overall effort (riots discourage development, for example).

Fifth, we should not condemn radical approaches that lie outside the bounds of conventional morality. For instance, if there is a direct attack on a biotechnology company that released GM mosquitoes we should recognize the culprits as engaging in an important task. Condemning them because of the violence or illegality of their actions doesn't make any sense. Every value system has a violent faction. Even the prevailing democratic industrial states have militaries, and if you support democratic industrial states then you should support those soldiers, those generals, and those politicians. Now, our situation is a little different because the conflict is asymmetric. Whereas prevailing states can clearly say ""bombing this area advances our strategy this way,"" asymmetric battles work a little differently. But the analogy is clear enough. 

Finally, we should recognize that even extreme actions like the one in the third point don't necessarily have to be strategic. Some people recognize that they aren't the people to lead a revolution, or that a revolution is impossible, but they do recognize that they can make an impact in ways that are outside conventional bounds, but perfectly within the bounds of their own moralities. We can recognize that their path is not for us, and we can recognize that in hindsight they might have done something even better, but the main demand should be very simple: do what you think you can so long as it lives up to your values and morals. Even though the ELF has a pretty different ideology from wildists, someone from the ELF put it pretty well when they wrote:  

&gt; In martial arts there's a concept that you're not fighting against another person but taking a stand against violence itself. You use only the minimum amount of force necessary to stop an attack. I'm in jail. I'm not going to be doing any more direct action, and I'm not saying anyone else should. But what would a truly moral direct action look like? Maybe it would mean taking in the pain of your victims—opening your heart to them, being wholly present with them—and at the same time truly taking in the pain they're causing to the natural world. Meditating on it. Fully contemplating it. And then, at the end of that process, perhaps deciding that the most compassionate thing in the world is to light their buildings on fire.

These are two different conversations. If you're talking about your personal interests, you're absolutely right. But if you're talking about larger social problems, your personal attitudes toward a personal situation is not going to make good policy. If your desire is to integrate black people into the social fabric of the US, then clamping down on crime is definitely part of the policy solution. But it's not all of it. Economic and social conditions also have to improve. Institutional changes need to be made. And all that isn't an outgrowth of the ""take personal responsibility"" argument, which, again, is entirely legitimate when we are talking about individuals, but not social groups.

94,"A few things: 

1. Those statistics aren't actually that insane. The ratio isn't so off that other contributing factors couldn't explain the disparities. 

2. There are clearly other contributing factors. Blacks live in pretty bad social conditions fairly frequently in the US, but also black culture is imbued with certain unhelpful elements when it comes to controlling crime---a ""culture of honor,"" mistrust of the police, historical consciousness of racism. Plus, there are problems other than economics, clearly. 

3. If you don't accept any of this, you can only explain the disparity one of two ways: the ""personal responsibility"" thesis and the biological difference thesis. The first is pretty untenable. It assumes that people's desires and motivations come from basically nowhere. But they are pretty clearly the product of more powerful forces. ""You can do what you will but you cannot will what you will."" As for the biological differences thing, we can reject the PC idea that there are NO significant biological differences between populations, but the evidence is only for really rather minor differences that wouldn't account for such a big disparity, especially given the general unity of human nature. 

So is your argument the biological one, which can quickly veer into traditional racism, or is it the personal responsibility one, which rests on outdated notions of free will? ",2016-08-15 20:39:19+00:00,d6isc5b,4.0,t1_d6iocb1,5042.0,news
95,"That's an enormous social question that can't be answered in a reddit comment. But if you're interested in some potential answers, there's a lot of literature on the topic. Contrary to BLM, I would actually say that if you want to integrate blacks in the US into the social fabric, more, smarter, and better policing is necessary, not less. That said, I tend to agree with political radicals that integration into the prevailing social order isn't necessarily a good goal. But I'm not trying to convince people of that. 

The big point to remember is that in general, black people _do_ want to improve their lives. But what ""improvement"" means and what is the most rational decision for black individuals right now is shaped by incentives, which are produced by social and material conditions. For instance, when I lived in a mostly black trailer park with my mother, it was way more rational for young people in the neighborhood to deal drugs than to get a conventionally legitimate job. It ensured safety, it didn't involve breaking all the social ties they'd built over the years, it made good money, etc. It wasn't an absolutely stupid decision. And we can't expect for people in these kinds of conditions to ""think long term"" when such a thing is difficult for so many humans in general. As a matter of social policy, it's just going to fail and won't solve the problem. So you can adopt that stance, but you just have to recognize that the trade-off is continuing racial tension.

However, is it really surprising that this kind of racial violence is occurring in Milwaukee, one of the most racially segregated places in the US? I think these riots prove BLM's point from a distance. It isn't that the individual justifications for the actions are correct, but that the reasons for these individual's anger still very much exist, aren't memories of an era of ""past racism,"" and are structural before they are based on personal beliefs. 

I hope that at least more than a handful of people recognize this, despite the inevitable torrent of one-sided analyses that will come in this age of clickbait titles and social media.

EDIT: To be clear, these actions are pretty stupid, no matter the existence of segregation in Milwaukee.

100,"&gt; arent the problems we face quite a bit more dire?

Definitely. I encourage you to keep an eye on the HG series ""[The Critique of Progress](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/the-critique-of-progress/),"" because I explain why exactly this is true in a forthcoming essay, ""Argument Against the Future."" 

&gt; Is it possible that our current civilization will cause too much harm to the planet possibly wiping out most or all life before it has the time to fall under its own weight?

Yes, this is a very real possibility. 

&gt; And further more if that scenario is a possibility does that matter?

It depends on who you are talking to, but members of the Wild Will Coalition don't think so. We are all going to die one day, but that doesn't stop us from acting according to our values and interests, right? It's kind of the same thing here. If you think that what is currently going on is wrong, and if you want to act in a way you think is right, then do not let the future stop you from doing this. This is why we use the slogan ""Live wild or die!"" And of course, given that it is still possible for industry to collapse, even those who think it is unlikely would probably agree that to not take the chance we have is irresponsible. 

&gt; I also want to know if we should be actively trying to bring down civilization

and

&gt; [do] you believe that we can do anything of meaning to halt the destruction of the planet by our disgusting civilization.

I don't think that any group, much less a group as small as wildists, will bring about the collapse of civilization. This is about discerning what we think is right based on our values. Do we respect this disgusting civilization, as you put it? No! So why should we live as though we do? 

Now, I tend to think that we need to not act unreasonably, without any regard for the effects of our actions. There are ways to engage in our rewilding so that the effect is maximized. So to the extent that this is possible, we should aim for it. For example, I could just be acting according to my values as a lone wolf, not trying to find like-minded people. But by maximizing the influence of these ideas with the internet and books, and by connecting with like-minded people, I ensure that they will have a greater impact, and instead of a one-off event I have possibly made a lasting influence with my actions. However, even if the plan doesn't pan out, which plans have a tendency to do, I know that I have acted in a way that I can look back on and say, ""I did the right thing."" 

&gt; Shouldnt we be actively trying to crack the few myths left that still hold the trust of the public?

However, I think it is clear that the magnitude of our current troubles demands a more radical approach to conservation, if for no other reason than to grant more legitimacy to moderate approaches like the kinds taken by The Wildlands Network. If you are ready to make the sacrifices inherent in this kind of work, and if you are interested in the benefits, like being able to live up to your values with integrity and without compromise, consider [joining the Wild Will Coalition](http://wildism.org/about).

**Two**: Be aware that we aren't trying to establish a wildist society. We do not believe that you can make a society conform to your blueprint. Environmental, economic, climactic, demographic, etc. conditions are much more powerful forces in determining the character of a society. 

We are also not trying to proselytize or make everyone believe in the wildist philosophy. We are trying to find those to whom the ideas speak, basically, and then we work to maximize the influence of our small groups. There are good techniques for making this happen. For radical political techniques, see *[The Organizational Weapon](http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R201.html)*, for example. 

Finally, we don't have a plan to get to our ideal. Our ideal helps provide direction for our values and helps us communicate those values, but we are not going to achieve that, that much is sure. It's even possible that no one will ever achieve it. The more important question is how our values clash or jive with the world we live in now. Do we respect this civilized way of life, or don't we? If we don't, then we decide where our loyalties lie and act. This can be done in a moderate way (e.g., conservation) or a radical way (e.g., rewilding) or an extremely radical way (e.g., reaction). Now, in the future there could be times of economic instability or something similar that we can then take advantage of to ""de-industrialize"" large regions. At that time, there are some available tactics and strategies from history of revolutions, warfare, and popular revolts. In our current moment, then, it makes sense to learn from these.

But as far as what I think people in the US can do now (the US specifically because that's where I live), I suggest conservation for sure, and I also say that I do not think major disruptions in key developed areas, through riots or natural disasters, are necessarily a bad thing, and if they are intentional, I'm not going to condemn them on the basis of their violence or illegality alone. 

**Three**: Well, to give a general, logical answer that isn't necessarily convincing: if you value wild nature to the degree we do, it's pretty easy to see that civilization isn't our friend. Now, for a more thorough and convincing explanation, I suggest Ted Kaczynski's ""[Industrial Society and Its Future](http://wildism.org/rca/items/show/13)."" You might also pay special attention to the upcoming posts in *Hunter/Gatherer*'s series ""[The Critique of Progress](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/the-critique-of-progress/)."" In about two weeks an important installment in that series will be published, ""The Argument Against the Future,"" which is probably one of the better introductory summaries of why we should question Progress. [Sign up for our email list](http://eepurl.com/b_nX7z) for a notification when it is published. 

Finally, we do not reject technics, simplistic technics even less so. Rather, we reject civilization, especially industrial civilization. I don't think I'll necessarily be able to convince you if quotes like these don't speak to you: 

* Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit, and as vital to our lives as water and good bread. - Ed Abbey

* Wilderness is an anchor to windward. Knowing it is there, we can also know that we are still a rich nation, tending our resources as we should — not a people in despair searching every last nook and cranny of our land for a board of lumber, a barrel of oil, a blade of grass, or a tank of water. - Senator Clinton Anderson

* For the 99 percent of the time we’ve been on Earth, we were hunter and gatherers, our lives dependent on knowing the fine, small details of our world. Deep inside, we still have a longing to be reconnected with the nature that shaped our imagination, our language, our song and dance, our sense of the divine. - Jenine Benyus

* The reason to preserve wilderness is that we need it. We need wilderness of all kinds, large and small, public and private. We need to go now and again into places where our work is disallowed, where our hopes and plans have no standing. We need to come into the presence of the unqualified and mysterious formality of Creation. - Wendell Berry

* If future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than contempt, we must leave them something more than the miracles of technology. We must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning, not just after we got through with it. - President Lyndon B. Johnson

* This need is for areas of the earth within which we stand without our mechanisms that make us immediate masters over our environment - areas of wild nature in which we sense ourselves to be, what in fact I believe we are, dependent members of an interdependent community of living creatures that together derive their existence from the Sun. By very definition this wilderness is a need. The idea of wilderness as an area without man's influence is man's own concept. Its values are human values. Its preservation is a purpose that arises out of man's own sense of his fundamental needs. - Howard Zahniser

Of course, not all of these point toward wildism, but they illustrate a spectrum of beliefs at the extreme of which wildism sits and is ready to benefit them all by bringing the ideas to their logical conclusion. If you find that some of these quotes speak to you, I encourage you to get involved in conservation and to consider a more extreme, no-compromise defense of wild nature.

103,"Most don't think it's likely we'll return to the hunter/gatherer lifestyle. We offer the ideal because it's the other extreme of industrial society, so people who tend toward that ideal are less likely to feel any loyalty toward industrial institutions. Also, some regions wouldn't be able to practice agriculture without industrial technics, because of a lack of arable land, so people who are willing to act against the whole of industry had best be okay with a hunter/gatherer outcome. So sometimes I say that we are willing to dispense with industry even to the point of becoming hunter/gatherers. 

That said, I really want to be clear that our desire isn't to enforce a certain blueprint onto a society. We mention hunter/gatherers because it gives people a rough idea what kind of wildness would placate us. But the key is that we value wildness itself, not necessarily the nomadic hunter/gatherer way of life. This means that our morals and values can help us discern what to do in the present, regardless of whether we can ""return to the hunter/gatherer lifestyle."" Agricultural chiefdoms? By giving the hunter/gatherer ideal, I'm indicating that I would probably clash with that mode of organization in some important ways, and if I had my way perfectly I'd probably remove myself from it. (Of course, in real life if I was born in a chiefdom I'd probably not care as much.)

Finally, do know that we will never return to pre-Neolithic times, at least not in any practical time period. That's an indicator of the level of wildness, but a comparable level of wildness in the future could produce large scavenger societies, people taking advantage of tools and ruins, etc. There's no way to know what it would look like.

106,"Yes, this is true. This is why some naturalists write that the ""is/ought"" problem is false in some contexts / from a certain perspective (see, e.g., E.O. Wilson in *On Human Nature*). According to a naturalist understanding, after all, these values stem from our biology (e.g., our brains in interaction with our environment). This is why some moral attitudes like incest taboos or certain elements of altruism can and have been shaped by natural selection, so are strongly engrained in human nature. 

However, the same naturalistic understanding helps explain moral diversity. Different selection pressures, plus the malleability of the majority of human social behavior, account for differences in deeply held values among individuals. So we can't say that there is an objective morality in this sense. **EDIT**: The point, then, is not quite that values don't exist materially, just that they are not discovered in the world external to the individual.

Philosophical discourse has not quite caught up to these realities, so it is sometimes confusing. But suffice it to say that practically speaking, the naturalistic account allows the position of moral nihilism to be true.

In the next issue of HG, I will be explaining most of this. See the forthcoming article ""The Basis of Morality."" ",2016-08-14 00:12:37+00:00,d6ghei9,4.0,t1_d6gh51c,437.0,DebateAnarchism

109,"&gt; It also includes its opposite; that is the nature of flux.

Sure, but that could still be integrated in the argument against the future. What you're describing is a cyclical outlook on the development of civilizations, and it is very much incompatible with the notion that the future of civilization definitely holds a better tomorrow. 

&gt; then I don't see how you would expect to not encounter violent opposition

Perhaps, and in many cases, probably. But we don't live in the future, we live in the present. I really try avoid this speculation about a future apocalypse. It may never even come. The question is how we act on our values now. 

&gt; How do you justify your groups existence and the furtherance of your goals to antagonists? 

You don't; they are antagonists. We aren't going to convince everyone---you for example---and that's fine. We pretty blatantly say ""take it or leave it,"" and expect there to be conflict in cases where people disagree in a very fundamental way. 

&gt; I don't think your spiritual arguments hold much water; too many people are capable of finding transcendental meaning both in humanity and in more controlled forms of 'nature'.

To be clear, spirituality is not the focus. It's a personal element of many of our belief systems. I mentioned it because people around anarchist circles tend to think that philosophical naturalism is inherently disenchanting. 

&gt; How do you justify the assertion that 'the values of civilisation are baseless', when your own values are products of a civilisation, to the extent you find it useful to refer to US government legislation?

That isn't the argument. The argument is that technical development proceeds at such a fast rate, and has so much power over the creation of values themselves, that the very values by which we measure Progress become irrelevant. As Charles Rubin put it in *Eclipse of Man*, these are some problems inherent in nanotechnics and biotechnics: 

&gt; It becomes harder and harder for our authors to imagine what will be retained, hence where change will start from. And if the rate of change is accelerating, that simply means we are headed the more rapidly from one unknown to another, while the recognizable old standards for judging whether the changes are progressive are overthrown with our humanity.",2016-08-13 17:58:04+00:00,d6g3i1w,4.0,t1_d6g0z7i,4058.0,DebateAnarchism

&gt; specifically American nature of your idea of 'wildness'

and

&gt; Given this, I don't really see how 'rewilding' isn't anything other than imposing ones own particular, culturally specific will on an environment

Well yes, if I was to start with similar theoretical commitments it _would_ be akin to people imposing their will on the environment, and that will _would_ be culturally constructed. However, it's unclear how anyone can escape this. So I'm unsure of how anyone can do differently, and why this matters at all. ""If we are _committed to our commitments_, then we need not relinquish them just because somebody else disagrees with us."" --- [Kaebnick 2008](http://www.jstor.org/stable/25165349).

&gt; It seems to me that this idea contains echos of the 'pristine myth', the idea of an 'untouched' land only recently 'violated' by human presence.

Well, [the essay](http://wildism.org/hg/article/the-nature-artifice-distinction/) specifically addresses the pristine myth, so those interested in a fuller answer should check it out. But also, be aware that the pristine myth has not really been held by the vast majority of conservationists since the Wilderness Act (at least, and speaking reservedly here). Recall that the act defines wilderness as ""_untrammeled_ by man"" --- not untouched: 

&gt; un·tram·meled (ˌənˈtraməld/, adjective)
&gt; not deprived of freedom of action or expression; not restricted or hampered.

Also, recall that the goal of rewilding isn't to return a place to its pristine state. Most nature has permanently left that condition if ever it was in it. Rewilding attempts to remove human abilities to manufacture and control nature down to the level of control inherent in the nomadic hunter/gatherer mode of subsistence. From there, the impacts of human control may wash out immediately, or it may take centuries. Either way, the end result isn't going to be pristine, but wild. 

&gt; Do you have any interaction with Native American groups?

Speaking personally: I do not interact with Native American groups or any Native people on a political basis. Nor is that necessary. If a group or a Native person believes roughly the things we do or wants to ally with us, then, like everyone else, we will work with them. 

&gt; 'civilisations tend towards collapse'? Civilisations, like nature (of which civilisations and all of human activity is, in my view, a part1) tend towards flux.

If you want to call it ""flux,"" then that flux includes recession, depression, and collapse. Some popular books that demonstrate the collapse-prone nature of civilizations include *A Short History of Progress* by Ronald Wright and *Collapse* by Jared Diamond. You might also try *The Collapse of Complex Societies* by Joseph Tainter. 

&gt; is there any reason, beyond the somewhat circular argument of 'artificiality', that makes any potential changes caused by it so uniquely terrible that the proposed solution is to dismantle human civilisation...?

No, the reason is that it is artificial, or anthropogenic. However, be aware that wildists are in general not overly concerned with climate change. It is a problem, yes, but the undull emphasis on it stems from concern for civilization more than it stems from concern for wild nature. 

&gt; There seems to me to a desire to somehow arrest the process of nature in this notional state of wildness, but that is impossible.

Rewilding is the exact opposite of arresting natural processes. See the definitions and discussions above and in ""[The Nature/Artifice Distinction](http://wildism.org/hg/article/the-nature-artifice-distinction/).""

Finally, your above post is pretty clearly influenced by postmodernism, whether you know it or not. I recommend reading ""Reinventing Nature?""

113,"Hey, thanks for your input. I want to point out that the argument against the future isn't sufficient for a critique of Progress. It is only important to note because the critiques lead people to look for new values. In an upcoming article for the [Critique of Progress series](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/the-critique-of-progress/), I write: 

&gt; A central element of the Idea of Progress is the belief that the good developments of the past will continue getting better in the future. Of course, even if this were false, the bulk of the progressive narrative could remain true, so to tear down this pillar would only compromise the idea's structural integrity, not necessarily bring it crashing down. But refuting it is an important task nonetheless, not least because the promise of a better future is the reason the Idea of Progress has such strength. If I may extend the architectural metaphor, it is the reason people decide to inhabit the House of Progress in the first place. Should it become clear that there is no hope for future Progress, or that Progress itself threatens this hope, a search for new values is necessary.

So you are correct in most of your rebuttals above. 

As for your thoughts on ""limits,"" I criticize the vulgar limits to growth argument in the same article I quoted above. I'm personally convinced of many of Julian Simon and the eco-modernists' economic arguments: lots of limits, if they even exist, just aren't a big deal economically. There still are some limits, however, which no one can really deny, and in the context of collapse, political inertia, etc. the argument gets a lot more nuanced. 

And regarding knowledge: there is a limit to knowledge so long as we remain biological creatures and our knowledge-gaining abilities are physically restricted to the organ of the brain. Who knows if we're approaching it. But that's not really my point. There are limits to knowledge in the old philosophical sense --- see, e.g., [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine), [Lakatos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos), or [Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn). These are a lot like the economic limits to growth arguments: they simply don't matter in most cases. The strongest arguments against the future are the ones having to do with collapse and values.

115,"&gt; Can I have a word for everything not made or controlled by bees?

If you want one and think it's significant. 

&gt; Why is this distinction important? What is so special about the stuff humans haven't interacted with?

Well, do you think it's significant that human civilization is changing the global climate? Or that we can tear down entire forests? Or that we can cultivate huge amounts of land? The nature/artifice distinction provides a language for a lot of these things.

Also, what we have defined as wildness _is_ valued in many contexts, so it makes sense to have a word for it. For example, from ""[Refocusing Ecocentrism](http://www.thewildernist.org/2015/09/refocusing-ecocentrism/)"" by Ned Hettinger and Bill Throop:

&gt; Numerous examples from ordinary life suggest that people do value wildness in a variety of contexts. For instance, admiration of a person’s attractive features is likely to diminish when it is learned that they were produced by elective plastic surgery. People prefer the birth of a child without the use of drugs or a Caesarean section, and they do so not just because the former may be more conducive to health. Picking raspberries discovered in a local ravine is preferable to procuring the store-bought commercial variety (and not just because of the beauty of the setting). Our appreciation of catching cut-throat trout in an isolated and rugged mountain valley is reduced by reports that the Department of Fish and Game stocked the stream the previous week. Imagine how visitors to Yellowstone would feel about Old Faithful if they thought that the National Park Service put soap into the geyser to regulate and enhance its eruptions. In each example, people value more highly what is less subject to human alteration or control than a more humanized variant of the same phenomenon. The value differential may result from several features of these cases, but central among them is the difference in wildness. Notice that if we focus on different aspects of these situations, the judgment of wildness changes: the mountain stream may be wild in many respects, even if its fish are not. Although we value wildness in many things, an ecocentric ethic will focus on the value of the wildness of natural systems.
&gt;
&gt; In addition to such specific judgments, there are powerful and widespread general intuitions that support the value of the nonhumanized. People rightfully value the existence of a realm not significantly under human control—the weather, the seasons, the mountains, and the seas. This is one reason why the idea of humans as planetary managers is so objectionable to many.[31] Consider a world in which human beings determine when it rains, when spring comes, how the tides run, and where mountains rise. The surprise and awe we feel at the workings of spontaneous nature would be replaced by appraisal of the decisions of these managers. Our wonder at the mystery of these phenomena would not survive such management. People value being a part of a world not of their own making. Valuing the wild acknowledges that limits to human mastery and domination of the world are imperative.",2016-08-13 03:02:20+00:00,d6fgy5w,4.0,t1_d6fgduv,973.0,DebateAnarchism

118,"Hey /u/imapoisson, this is an excellent question. Speaking in terms of moderate conservation, [The Wildlands Network](http://www.wildlandsnetwork.org) has provided the best model for rewilding in the Americas. I explain it in a very cursory way [in a YouTube video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0EOqroHnzs) and one of the best texts relevant to the US is Dave Foreman's *[Rewilding North America](http://amzn.to/29Wc7XH).*

Also, a lot of the issues around management or the tension between wildness and biodiversity, were discussed early in The Wildlands Project's history in their now-defunct publication *Wild Earth.* The Environment and Society Portal (a great companion to [RADCON Archives](http://www.wildism.org/rca/)) has [provided scans of a few old *Wild Earth* issues](http://www.environmentandsociety.org/mml/collection/ef?field_subcollection_earth_first_value=Wild+Earth).

In general, I suggest we err on the side of *less human management.* However, there are some pretty clear areas where management is needed in our current conditions, e.g., controlled burnings. It's a balance that needs to be carefully considered in each situation. 

As for reintroducing species, there are some great success stories, and Ned Hettinger and Bill Throop explain how it is compatible with wildness-centered conservation in their fantastic article, ""[Refocusing Ecocentrism: De-Emphasizing Stability and Defending Wildness](http://www.thewildernist.org/2015/09/refocusing-ecocentrism/)."" They explain that by restoring certain pillars of an ecosystem, it is possible for human influence to ""wash out"" over time, and even faster than if we had just left it alone completely. 

Along the same lines, please support the effort to [restore Glen Canyon](http://www.glencanyon.org)! The Glen Canyon Institute explains some of their work in an article on *The Wildernist*, ""[The Death and Rebirth of Glen Canyon](http://www.thewildernist.org/2015/05/death-rebirth-glen-canyon/)."" 

Now, when we get into the question of reaction, there is less room for compromise. The goal is to remove human impediments to wildness, full stop, not much else considered. This is dangerous if it exists by itself. But along with moderate conservation, I believe it can have a positive effect. And, more important, it's in line with a lot of my values.

119,"&gt; How will Wildism lead to the workers control over the means of production and a society built on self-managed free associations in replacement of hierarchical institutions? If it doesn't, why do you appropriate the term anarchism?

We won't and we don't call ourselves anarchists. 

&gt; Precisely how do you intend to rewild and restore lost natural ecosystems? Are you planning on just letting nature take its turn over the millenniums, or do you believe humans should facilitate the process?

This is a difficult question among conservationists. There's room for different answers. I recommend these texts: 

* [Nature Restoration as a Paradigm for the Human Relationship with Nature](http://hettingern.people.cofc.edu/Hettinger_Nature_Restoration_as_a_Paradigm_for_the_Human_Relationship_with_Nature.pdf) by Ned Hettinger

* [Rewilding and Biodiversity: Complementary Goals for Conservation](http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/MES/rewilding.pdf) by Michael Soule and Reed Noss

Personally, and speaking in terms of moderate conservation, I support conservation for biodiversity but with an eye toward making ecosystems self-sustaining. Dave Foreman's *[Rewilding North America](http://amzn.to/29Wc7XH)* explains some of the principles that go into this kind of restoration. Cores, Carnivores, and Connectivity: make habitats larger, focus on keystone species that have cascading effects on the food web, and connect lands where possible. Radical rewilding could compliment this by contributing to disruption in developed areas that need to be undeveloped for wildlands connectivity. At the very least this would provide some attention for the cause, the way Earth First! did for its wilderness reserve system in the early days. 

&gt; What should happen to the humans that not longer can be supported by modern agriculture, or disabled people?

If civilization collapsed, many people would die. Disabled people would mostly die. But this isn't a question of pressing a button. This is a question of acting in accordance to our values where we stand. Our individual and small group actions aren't going to lead to the collapse of civilization. Plus, if my grandmother, for example, is living on a machine, my personal morals are obviously gonna clash with my political ones if the region in question becomes unstable. But I can't make that call now. I'll do it when/if the time comes and judging the circumstances, just like anarchists would have to if capitalism starts to become dysfunctional in certain regions. I can almost guarantee you though that I'll prioritize my family.

130,"&gt; I do understand the mentality that we should concentrate on saving what we still have. But I don’t think that needs to be mutually exclusive from de-extinction.

It doesn't have to be. There is no smoking-gun logical argument against de-extinction. A lot of has to do with sentiment. I think it is rather too risky to start meddling with de-extinction, and I tend to think of the overwhelming confidence that accompanies it as arrogance. Worse, it seems to be fueled by a desire for some positive environmental practice because for so long, to no fault of the conservationists, a lot of it has been negative, fighting rather than building. And instead of really assessing our abilities and knowledge realistically, we are jumping at this opportunity uncritically, without considering that maybe a mental bias for positivity has something to do with it. 

At base, I want to reiterate, the meddling is something I am inherently uncomfortable with, and none of the trade-offs people have pointed out (e.g., it COULD help PHYSICALLY restore ecosystem functioning) have convinced me. 

I feel the same way about rewilding efforts that go beyond simple reintroduction and are instead moving animals around as if they were puzzle pieces. Can we simply let nature restore itself? I understand that this comes with consequences related to physical quality of environments. But what about their wildness? Can we simply let nature go for a bit and stop putting that off with ""just one more experiment that will change everything for the better""?

131,"Yeah I read it, I just forgot to reply. Basically, I don't think it's wrong, factually. But a lot of the concern is moral, not empirical, so I still disagree that we _should_ de-extinct the sloth. Basically, because of a long list of reasons, I think we should take a more hands-off approach to the world that we haven't created, i.e., nature. Technical fixes tend to only produce more complexity and dependence on a system that is anything but hands off. So arguing that we should de-extinct any species sort of misses the larger issue of industrial practices, which are causing a lot of these problems, and in fact it rests on the existence of industry. So sure, de-extinction _may_ help an ecosystem --- while the same processes that permit it are destroying the stuff around us at a much higher rate.

Also, on the other side of this, I don't really want to live in the industrial society that is causing all these problems. I'd much rather live in a world where I have to deal with spontaneity and where I'd lose some level of security in order to have a higher degree of freedom. I'd rather be dependent on natural processes than artificial human ones. The latter tend to just make me angry and depressed. De-extinction requires a strict divide between what is considered good for humans (industrial society) and what is considered good for animals (wild nature) whereas I'm good with just living like an animal. All this stuff that produced civilization seems to have done more harm than good, at least for someone like me, who isn't too enthused about the supposed benefits. So when people argue for de-extinction, I feel like they're missing the point of people who are concerned with the deterioration of nature because that's the alternative should it become possible to leave this society's reach. They're trying to keep their cake and eat it too. 

As you can tell, I'm more of a dark green conservationist than a bright green environmentalist. So it's hard to imagine that I would ever support de-extinction, just because the very act of it violates some of my more deeply held moral beliefs.

&gt; But you disagree that things aren't as good for gay people than straight people? No. Because that's the point I made.

In many ways they are, but of course I don't disagree with that point when we consider things overall. That wasn't what I objected to, however. I specifically objected to these points: 

* I didn't know what I was talking about because I've been looking at the development of gay rights ""from the outside"" 
* Oppression for gay people in Western civilization is of special note
* ""The US has never been kind to us""
* No gay person would agree with me
* And now, that Trans issues are similar enough to LGB issues that we shouldn't consider them separately. 

&gt; And yes we are targets: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/16/us/hate-crimes-against-lgbt.html Your study is from 2012. Mine's from 2016.

Fair enough. Keep in mind my other point about hate crimes in general being very low in Western countries, but yeah, your data is more recent. 

&gt; You quantified my statements on some imaginary scale to start an argument.

Nah, I exaggerated in a colloquial way when writing some of my above statements, but the points I was making are direct contradictions to your actual statements, not straw men. 

&gt; and to your claim that I'm safe in any part of the world, are you fucking nuts?

Did I say that? Let's see: 

&gt; **In any developed part of the nation** you're extremely safe and because of technology &amp; changing opinions, if something homophobic happens to you, you could immediately rally support.

You ask: 

&gt; Is your world so small that you know only your own experiences?

I have explicitly avoided making statements about the global status of gay people, which is worse overall than, say, gay people in the UK or US are overall. My argument is that civilization and what you would probably refer to as ""Westernization"" (a questionable concept) is good for gay people from a social justice perspective, and it's the reason social justice has made strides on this issue. And once again, because of technology and globalization, even less developed nations are facing backlash from an international community that has largely stood behind gay rights (the UN, NGOs, etc.) 

&gt; We're more likely to be fired or homeless. Laws are being passed that make discrimination against us legal. How can you ignore that?

I've not ignored that once in my comments. I agree that: 

* Gay people face hate crimes, according to your data above to a higher degree than any other minority
* Gay youth homelessness is perhaps one of the worst problems gay people face right now
* Trans rights, even if they are a separate issue, is not in nearly as good a state
* etc.

That doesn't mean that my above comments, including: 

* Gay rights has been one of the fastest progressing social movements ever, if not THE fastest progressing
* Gay people have it pretty good in Western countries and most of the issues they face are not eminent, life or death issues (e.g., adoption, healthcare)
* Dominant powers (Western governments, international organizations, most media organizations) as a whole support gay rights

&gt; I see that fight as one in the same.

This is a side argument, I think, but I'll say that I think that, coming from a social justice perspective, it's way better to consider trans rights a separate issue from gay rights precisely because of the number of issues that are unique to them. Once again, the biggest reason they've been combined with gay rights is because they literally couldn't do anything else before, their cause being in an even worse position than now. And in any case, that most Western nations support gay rights but are still having some trouble with trans rights is evidence that most people regard them as separate issues (which contributes to the complex of problems each group faces, and therefore contributes to them being separate social issues, regardless of whether or not people are correct in seeing them as separate). 

&gt; Did you know the percentage of homeless LGBTQ youth outweigh the number of LGBTQ people in the general population? Did you know it's because LGBTQ people are kicked out of their homes and have a harder time finding jobs due to discrimination?

Yes, dude. I'm not ignorant of the general issues. Values and analysis are the points of contention here. 

Anyway, my position is quite a bit more complex than you're making it. I'm not saying things are perfect, just like you're not saying that things are horrendous. There's good and bad. The question is whether that justifies the claims about Western civilization, the US, my identity, trans issues, the progress of gay rights, etc. ",2016-08-06 20:32:22+00:00,d671447,12.0,t1_d66vrc7,9107.0,AskReddit

Because what you said specifically was wrong. 

&gt; We're still the #1 target of hate crime

[Not true](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2012/topic-pages/victims/victims_final) in the US --- racial hate-crimes are #1. And even if it were true, hate crimes in Western countries are extremely low. 

&gt; And way to just throw trans people under the bus.

What? I said they had separate issues, not that they weren't worth considering. It's clearly a separate problem. They face similar issues mostly in the same way that, say, black or brown people do. Did you read my post when it said that trans people have it bad right now?

139,"I'm not a troll, I just have different politics than you. You're apparently unaware of, for example, gay conservatives, which is totally a tendency of people with left-wing viewpoints, who seem to think that entire groups have homogeneous political opinions. 

My point is strengthened by your talking about health education. Sure, that's a problem. But speaking relative to everything else, it's really a small problem, and one I'm confident will be solved through the next few decades if we keep going down the path we are. It's hard to imagine that you could convincingly argue otherwise.

Trans issues are separate from gay issues and should have always been something separate, except for the fact that they couldn't be for so long. So yeah, things aren't excellent for trans people right now. But once again you can't say that Western civilization is a special case there, especially since most of the progress made for trans issues has been made in Western countries. 

And once again, my perspective doesn't mean I don't think bad things happen to gay people because they're gay. They do. That doesn't mean what you've been saying makes any sense. 

In other words, I'm not saying that gay people are perfectly well off. Of course that's not true. But you can't pretend that things are horrible, you can't pretend that gays have not made the fastest progress of ANY social movement, and you can't pretend that the problems we face --- especially in Western countries --- are anywhere near as bad as those in most existing non-Western countries or as bad as those in most human societies since civilization.

196,"[Here's](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/aug/29/nobody-better-at-being-human-richard-dawkins) why it's reasonable to assume Dawkins is talking about the triumph of reason over biology.

Here's a more explicit bit from Wilson, by the way: 

&gt; ...the creation of artificial life and artificial minds, seem destined to preoccupy a large part of science and high technology for the rest of the present century.... If our minds are to break free and dwell in the far more interesting universe of reason triumphant over superstition, it will be through advances in biology.

And to point out again that this isn't an uncommon view, [here's James Watson](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3451-stupidity-should-be-cured-says-dna-discoverer/), the discoverer of DNA, advocating eugenics. Of course they don't want to see a repeat of the old eugenics (the word is emotionally loaded) but it is eugenics nonetheless.",2016-07-31 19:21:22+00:00,d5ymub9,6.0,t1_d5ymf1t,498.0,Futurology
197,"&gt; We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism-something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.

This is the main aspect of the Dawkins quote. He is clearly making a jump here from the use of reason to the use of genetic engineering. ""We can _even_ discuss ways..."" 

The second one is the best quote I have for Singer. Like I said, I wish I could find his talks where he makes more explicit claims.

And EO Wilson _said_ we should work on changing our genes to make us altruistic toward nature, in that same chapter of the book. And he's said it many times. Well known for it. I'd provide more info if I could, can't right now, sorry. His wiki page should show some stuff. ",2016-07-31 19:11:22+00:00,d5ymcku,4.0,t1_d5ym2sd,407.0,Futurology
198,"The conclusion sums up his argument: 

&gt; Any human-pig chimera should, then, be assessed against the criteria of personhood. This is by no means straightforward. Just to give one example, if synthetic biology creates a network of neurons in vitro, this would raise the question of whether it could become conscious, how we would know if it did, and then the further question of how it should be treated. In the absence of conclusive research on these questions, any such chimera should be accorded the highest moral status consistent with its likely nature. If there is a chance a new lifeform could experience pain or might not be able to interact socially, and we don’t know, it should be treated as if it does experience pain and will have problems of social adaptation. Likewise, if it could plausibly have higher cognitive functions, it should be treated as if it would have them. In considering the new life forms we create, we should err on the side of sympathy and generosity.",2016-07-31 19:01:33+00:00,d5ylybx,1.0,t3_4vif27,598.0,philosophy
199,"The problem is that it isn't an uncommon thought. Peter Singer, EO Wilson, and Richard Dawkins have argued or implied similar things: 

Dawkins (_The Selfish Gene_): 

&gt; The point I am making now is that, even if we look on the dark side and assume that individual man is fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight-our capacity to simulate the future in imagination- could save us from the worst selfish excesses of the blind replicators. We have at least the mental equipment to foster our long-term selfish interests rather than merely our short-term ones…We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism-something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. 

What he's suggesting can't just be a cultural process. It has to involved genetic engineering as well. 

Singer (_A Darwinian Left_): 

&gt; We do not know to what extent our capacity to reason can, in the long run, take us beyond the conventional Darwinian constraints on the degree of altruism that a society may be able to foster. We are reasoning beings. In other works I have likened reason to an escalator, in that, once we start reasoning, we may be compelled to follow a chain of argument to a conclusion that we did not anticipate when we began. Reason provides us with the capacity to recognise that each of us is simply one being among others, all of whom have wants and needs that matter to them, as our needs and wants matter to us. Can that insight ever overcome the pull of other elements in our evolved nature that act against the idea of an impartial concern for all of our fellow humans, or, better still, for all sentient beings?

Once again, this can't be purely cultural. In some of his speeches Singer recognizes this and more heavily implies the use of biotechnology. I can't find them at the moment yet. 

EO Wilson (_On Human Nature_): 

&gt;  the preservation of the entire gene pool as a contingent primary value [is necessary—ET] until such time as an almost unimaginable greater knowledge of human heredity provides us with the option of a democratically contrived eugenics",2016-07-31 18:59:40+00:00,d5ylvkj,2.0,t1_d5ylnrl,326.0,Futurology

Being an individualists and an anti-civver makes sense; it's christianity that's the odd one out. It seems like you could only maintain the label of ""Christian"" with a very severe revision of orthodoxy. So what elements of Christianity do you hold on to, and what common elements of Christianity do you dismiss? I'm particularly interested in the following: 

* I think you said you believe Jesus literally resurrected. Is this true? 
* Humanism and collectivism generally stemmed from Christianity (historically). Do you argue that this mainstream approach --- that has been the dominant approach for at least centuries --- isn't what Jesus ""really taught""? If not, how can you still consider yourself a Christian if you aren't a collectivist? 
* Have you read Ellul's theological texts? What do you think? 
* How literal do you believe the miracles in the Bible to be? 
* What do you think about the notion of ""equality""? 

I'd love to open up a personal conversation at some point. The fact that you were inspired by individualists like Stirner, Kaczynski's ISAIF and, by proxy if not directly, Jacques Ellul means you and I have a lot in common. Also, although I am very much an atheist now, I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household until I was 14, so I can definitely relate.

Guess what? The Nazis didn't lose the war after all. They won it and flourished. They took over the world and wiped out every last Jew, every last Gypsy, black, East Indian, and American Indian. Then, when they were finished with that, they wiped out the Russians and the Poles and the Bohemians and the Moravians and the Bulgarians and the Serbians and the Croatians--all the Slavs. Then they started in on the Polynesians and the Koreans and the Chinese and the Japanese--all the peoples of Asia. This took a long, long time, but when it was all over, everyone in the world was one hundred percent Aryan, and they were all very, very happy. Naturally the textbooks used in the schools no longer mentioned any race but the Aryan or any language but German or any religion but Hitlerism or any political system but National Socialism. There would have been no point. After a few generations of that, no one could have put anything different into the textbooks even if they'd wanted to, because they didn't know anything different. But one day, two young students were conversing at the University of New Heidelberg in Tokyo. Both were handsome in the usual Aryan way, but one of them looked vaguely worried and unhappy. That was Kurt. His friend said, ""What's wrong, Kurt? Why are you always moping around like this?"" Kurt said, ""I'll tell you, Hans. There is something that's troubling me--and troubling me deeply."" His friend asked what it was. ""It's this,"" Kurt said. ""I cannot shake the crazy feeling that there is some small thing that we're being lied to about."" And that's how the paper ended.'
Ishmael nodded thoughtfully. 'And what did your teacher think of that?'

'He wanted to know if I had the same crazy feeling as Kurt. When I said I did, he wanted to know what I thought we were being lied to about. I said, 'How could I know? I'm no better off than Kurt.",2016-04-27 09:49:23+00:00,d2j4oz2,1.0,t3_4gnpl4,1264.0,books

264,"&gt; How can we not address a human population ...

""Address"" is where the trouble is. I acknowledge population and generally do not work with people on extended political projects if they can't as well (it's a good litmus test). But we can't DO much about it besides what we're already doing. 

&gt; What is the scope of 'technical infrastructure'?

Both of your examples qualify insofar as they are permanent solutions. The problem is how much control any such solution grants to technical systems, humans, or a group of humans. The idea is to break that control apart. That's the meaning of wildness. 

&gt; 'A third world family' is not an issue. A billion such families are. Your essay mentions a psychological experiment by Slovic, one that Stalin had previously performed: ""A single human death is a tragedy, a million human deaths is a statistic."" The bio-technician believes his work is ethical because it might help feed those billion third world families (as in 'golden rice'). Perhaps, in the realm of statistics, conventional ethics no longer hold.

I'm sorry, I don't really understand this comment. 

&gt; I assert that the abandonment of the current 'technical infrastructure' (fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, mining, damming rivers et cetera, et cetera), to an extent that can reverse this mass extinction, will so shrink Earth's carrying capacity that billions of people will perish. How is that different from mass murder? Apparently, you disagree.

I thought I explained this in the essay. In short, because radicals aren't gonna have a button to press and *poof* the industrial mode of production is decimated. Any disruption will look like something in Syria or Somalia or, at worst, Rwanda (meaning the disruption might create a vacuum where something like the Rwandan crises would happen).

I know that this is common in these types of arguments, but can you tell me what in this essay gave you that impression? I tried to show how technical development is autonomous not in the sense of a living being but in the sense that it evolves, which is actually a common theory and will likely become the dominant one soon. it can be understood in purely mechanical terms. 

As for the Garden of Eden bit, you're right again that most political views associated with technical autonomy that are anti-civilization are like that. But again the main point in the essay was not that nature was good, but that wildness was desirable and nature results from that. 

&gt; Civilization is not good nor evil, and it has no goal or means by which it operates. It doesn't promulgate an idea of progress nor growth nor capitalism or communism. It's just the manifestation of man's nature gone haywire.

Right, I don't actually think that we should talk about ""growth"" as though it were an inevitable part of civilization, because it doesn't have to be.

295,"Those are loaded terms so it's hard to say I have a position on them. They're like moving targets, and each leftist considers them to mean something different. I know that sounds like a cop-out, but it's true, and one of the main reasons it's so difficult to have a discussion about them. 

But I will make some comments regarding some meanings of the term. If we mean racism to mean ""racial prejudice"" and ""sexism"" to mean ""sexual or gender prejudice"" then they're just not my concern politically. Most of the time it's just rude, though, I can say that much. 

If we are to politicize ""sexism"" or ""racism"" we have to make them about actual structures. Sexism is a structure of patriarchy where the male gender is institutionally favored over females (replace with ""men"" and ""women"" depending on your theoretical terminology). And racism is an institutional advantage for whites over black and brown people. 

Here is gets complex because there is just so much that is theoretically confused and factually wrong about these left-wing theories. For instance, gender and sex are the same, and the separation comes from blank slate theories of human nature, which have been debunked since at least the cognitive revolution. Furthermore, sex is fully biological, and its biological roots do influence behavior. Thus, it is possible to explain some male/female discrepancies by deferring to biological differences between them (e.g., the wage gap, difference in temperaments and propensities toward violence, sexual practices, etc.). 

This allows, at most, for a classical liberal kind of feminism, which recognizes the differences but still advocates for political equality. But then we run into the contradiction between the humanist philosophy on which that is based and the wildist philosophy that underpins wildist conservation. Furthermore, there is some evidence that women are being coaxed and forced into roles they wouldn't want if left to their own devices, because that is what industry demands. For instance, there is a commonly known paradox that [the more ""feminist"" a society gets, the less happiness women report](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14969): 

&gt; By many objective measures the lives of women in the United States have improved over the past 35 years, yet we show that measures of subjective well-being indicate that women's happiness has declined both absolutely and relative to men. The paradox of women's declining relative well-being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well-being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging -- one with higher subjective well-being for men.

The difference between wildists and right-wingers is that wildists do not believe that women ""belong in the home"" and so try to force them into the role (that would be anathema to wildness). We do recognize, however, that if civilized control of nature was let go and nature, including human nature, flourished, something akin to ""stereotypical gender roles"" would flourish. This is similar to a way an ecosystem flourishes when a dam or road is removed. 

Thus, any attempt to enforce the abstract blueprint of what humans SHOULD be amounts to progressivism. We'd be best to let the world be wilder and recognize the natural world that results as a source of anxiety and happiness, fear and awe, ambivalence and love. That's the complexity of our relationship with this world, and progressivists are too myopic and arrogant to properly situate themselves in that very real material condition. We are a restless species, it seems.  ",2016-03-21 20:12:11+00:00,d189gpc,9.0,t1_d186tmd,3514.0,anarcho_primitivism

Not only that, but there is loads of evidence that a world without industrial civilization will be almost the exact opposite of all the core values of industrial progressivists. 

There is a left wing that is critical of technology and that espouses ideas that take progressive values to such extremes that they would indeed collapse civilization if taken seriously. This has been called ""the regressive left."" But they retain progressivist values and are confused regarding facts, so we should dismiss them and distance ourselves from them.

But the reason we advocate disrupting the industrial mode of production beyond repair is because it enforces the order of natural limits without naively relying on humans to enforce this limit themselves.

303,"&gt; The Jacobi mob is as Leftist as you can get - revolutionary-minded, academic, and organisational.

Yes, as the anarchists and many primitivists use the term, we are ""leftists."" This only references the Old Left, however, and is a different meaning than we intend when we say we need to separate from leftism. The ambiguity is so frustrating that I actually don't use the term anymore, and have split it into ""progressivism,"" ""opportunism"" and, occasionally, ""humanism"" (the dominant progressivist narrative). But for an earlier take on the issue, with the same positions but still utilizing the term ""leftist,"" see [A sketch of wildism in contrast to leftism](http://www.thewildernist.org/blogs/hg/2015/09/sketch-of-wildism-contra-leftism/).

So I basically agree with you, although again, I really don't understand why you keep calling me statist. If it's only because I advocate the wilderness system and the endangered species act as tools, then fine, I guess, but that's pretty absurd. I don't advocate taking state power as a method of revolution against industry, though. I don't think that's necessarily contradictory, but it almost certainly wouldn't work, and I'll never advocate it.

Also, one more question: why isn't this argument placed under the ableist objection to anti-civ ideology? It doesn't seem fundamentally different.

374,"Yeah, I understand. But that is, as you know, hardly a critique of the arguments or even a challenge to the premises. And since that is the point of /r/philosophy, it's unfortunate that the text was removed presumably on the basis of its unconventional nature, rather than its arguments. 

It's still unclear to me how the argument presented wasn't well-argued, a philosophical thesis, and English-language, but since it isn't the right for /r/philosophy, I'm still interested in alternatives. Do you have any suggestions? ",2016-01-18 21:09:30+00:00,cz34vpm,4.0,t1_cz33wbz,1387.0,philosophy

382,"Hi, I wrote this. I'd be happy to hear what's wrong with it, especially compared to people who have pushed similar arguments with every point made. 

* Objective morality -&gt; Sam Harris, Joseph Daleiden, Joshua Greene, etc.
* Ethical obligations to nature -&gt; deep ecologists, including those in the ethics journals _Environmental Ethics_ or _Environmental Values_
* Cosmos as Divinity -&gt; A kind of ""pantheism"" that, if you read the section (page 20) mentions Dawkins, Hitchens, Einstein, Spinoza, Sagan, etc, with sources that you can check yourself.
* Anti-Industrial Reaction -&gt; Commonly talked about within radical environmentalism. Not mainstream, but hardly insane. Again, read the section (it's short).  
* etc.

386,"If you really want to know my thoughts, I wrote an essay about it, [""The Foundations of Wildist Ethics""](http://wildism.org/hg/1/1/hg1-1foundations.pdf) (PDF). I specifically call out the medical field as being a ""humanist ethical science"" and challenge the idea that it's good across the board (p. 13, among other places). 

For example, following Sevareid's law, industrial medical solutions have now brought us new diseases, the threat of large-scale pandemics, and antimicrobial resistance, among other things. (See _The Coming Plague_ by Laurie Garrett.)

You're right, there's good, but it's impossible to separate that from the bad. So it becomes a question of how to evaluate the balance. When is the bad too high a cost for the good? I don't think everyone will agree, but we ought to be aware of the problem and actually think about it. ",2016-01-18 00:43:04+00:00,cz24y64,5.0,t1_cz23lqt,2036.0,AskReddit
