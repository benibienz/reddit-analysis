Hi everyone. This is John Jacobi. I'm one of the main popularizers of wildism, a radical conservation philosophy that emphasizes the importance of wildness in conserving and restoring nature. I and /u/jeremygrolman, and maybe a few others from the [Wild Will Coalition](http://www.wildism.org) will be answering your questions for the week. 

**EDIT:** Some people who will be answering are ESLers. Please feel free to ask for clarifications if you don't quite understand. 

I'm currently working on [a series explaining wildism](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/foundations-of-wildism/) which is being published on *Hunter/Gatherer*, so I encourage you to check out the posts so far. It will eventually be published as a book, [_Wildism: A Philosophy for Conservation, Rewilding, and Reaction_](http://wildism.org/omp/index.php/primitive-editions/catalog/book/1), which HG supporters will receive for free through [our Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/huntergathererjournal). However, because it is unfinished, I will give you a brief overview of wildism here. 

------

## History

Wildism is a philosophy that was borne out of multiple influential ideologies, including anarchism, primitivism, radical conservation (the early Earth First! kind), and [Ted Kaczynski's idiosyncratic brand of what he used to call anarchism](http://wildism.org/rca/collections/show/2). Up until fairly recently, I was almost exclusively the main popularizer of the ideas in the US, even though they were a result of a dialogue between anarchists, Kaczynski himself, environmentalists, and other individuals who, like me, were dissatisfied with prevailing ecological movements. Now, wildists are found in several US states, Germany, South America, Mexico, the UK, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. The eco-extremists in Mexico have to some degree also been influenced by wildism, largely because we have the same ideological influences, i.e., Kaczynski and his political associates in Spain. [The editorial](http://wildism.org/hg/article/some-context-for-issue-six/) for the sixth issue of HG explains all of this as well as my personal political trajectory since leaving anarchism. 

Briefly, wildism spread in the following way: 

* I began corresponding with Ted Kaczynski, which I explain a little in [my review](http://wildism.org/hg/article/review-anti-tech-revolution-why-and-how-by-ted-kaczynski/) of his forthcoming book, *Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How*. I left anarchism. I joined a group of political associates of Ted Kaczynski, the most prominent of which are [Ultimo Reducto](http://ultimoreductosalvaje.blogspot.com) and the editor of [Ediciones Isumatag](http://isumatag.blogspot.com). Originally ""wildism"" was a name for the ideas that we as a group espoused.

* My own associates grew in number and I split from the Spaniards, which is explained in [the aforementioned editorial](http://wildism.org/hg/article/some-context-for-issue-six/). My associates and I formed The Wildist Institute, now [Wild Will](http://www.wildism.org). This was a very small group, only four active members and a few correspondents. For the most part, our ideas did not differ much from the Spaniards much at this point, at least from our point of view, but because of the split ""wildism"" came to technically refer only to our own views. Out of this conversation, I was tasked with producing the first major text explaining our views ""The Foundations of Wildist Ethics."" We now recognize that there are some important problems with this text (it was our first attempt, after all) which is why I am working on the book now, but it is useful to read for historical purposes. 

* We grew rapidly and switched to a network infrastructure of groups operating under the name ""Wild Will"" (or Voluntad Salvaje, or Dikaya Volya). See ""Groups, Projects, and People"" below. We whittled down the core aspects of our shared beliefs (the initial text was heavily influenced by my personal views, so it was highly idiosyncratic and is no longer representative of the composition of Wild Will). I started HG, /u/jeremygrolman started [Blog for Wild Nature](http://forwildnature.org), Jonah took ahold of [The Wildernist](http://thewildernist.org), etc. Basically, we've reached a sort of stasis from which we can start actively interacting with tendencies outside of ourselves, and we can now confidently produce a text explaining the core of our views.

## Beliefs

Wildism can be divided into three core beliefs, from which most of our other conclusions are derived. 

### 1. A naturalistic worldview

The title is not, strictly speaking, accurate, since not all of us personally adhere to strict naturalism. However, we all hold _more or less_ naturalistic beliefs. There is no supernatural realm, no god, etc. While most of us are religious in some sense, our beliefs are personal and akin to ""[religious naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_naturalism)."" For example, while we might identify the divine and sublime in a bee, the bee as god is the same as the naturalistically understood bee. Essentially, it is an affirmation that the natural world is enough. But this is personal. 

More important are the philosophical positions that can be derived from the naturalistic worldview as we see it. For example, we are value nihilists because we do not believe that value is inherent in the world, sometimes called ""objective value."" We instead believe that values come from the individual. 

Also, we do not believe that we have free will in the _suis generis_ sense. Our actions are entirely determined by things like the environment, biology, etc. ""Free will"" in the folk sense is of course real. You can choose to stop reading this right now. But this is a compatibilist notion of free will and can appropriately relegate the notion to the realm of ""useful fictions."" 

Similarly, we believe that the character and operation of societies are strongly determined by things like the natural environment, [human nature](http://wildism.org/hg/article/the-meaning-of-human-nature/), and modes of subsistence. We reject [the Durkheimian view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_social_science_model) that culture is ""autonomous"" and can only be explained in terms of itself.

### 2. Rejection of all forms of progressivism

We reject the idea that civilization has improved, is improving, and will improve the human condition. This is called ""[the Idea of Progress](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/the-critique-of-progress/)."" We reject it on these grounds: 

#### ""Argument Against the Future""

* Civilizations tend towards collapse
* The values of civilization become baseless as technical development speeds up
* Technical evolution is quickly undermining even deeply held dominant values, like democracy
* There are some important epistemic and economic limitations on the growth of knowledge and the economy

**Edit**: Questions about this section: [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/4xf0w3/2016_ama_on_wildism/d6fl3uy), [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/4xf0w3/2016_ama_on_wildism/d6fpfee)

#### ""Argument Against Humanity""

* We reject the idea that every human being has equal moral standing. We prioritize ourselves and our close ""relations""--or those things, people, animals, and environments with whom we have a close relationship. This notion stems from [Hume's ideas about natural and artificial values](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#artnat), and the closely related notions of kinship and its relationship to human nature in biology. This position can be philosophically classified as a type of egoism.
* We also reject attempts to extend the humanist imperative to sentient creatures or all of nature, i.e., ""progressive ecocentrism."" Our approach is to reject humanism, not extend it. 
* We also, therefore, reject notions of racial solidarity, national solidarity, etc. These are all examples of what we call ""promiscuous solidarity,"" or the extension of the notion of moral standing to groups outside of our relations. This is because such an extension necessarily involves artificial regulation and control. Consider, for instance, [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), which explains that after a group reaches a certain size, more rules and regulations are necessary for it to remain cohesive. National and racial solidarity are means by which early societies enforced or reinforced this unity, which was threatened by the tendency of humans to break off into small groups (undesirable, of course, because it challenged agricultural production and the primacy of the state); nowadays, in our global industrial world, solidarity has been expanded to all of humanity. 

#### ""Argument Against Artifice""

* We reject the imperative to control and manufacture nature. This does not mean that we reject controlling and manufacturing nature; only the *imperative* to do so. We extoll a relationship with nature that is characterized by *wildness*. To illustrate roughly what degree of wildness that kind of relationship might have, we point to the level of control (or non-control) inherent in the nomadic hunter/gatherer mode of subsistence.
* Some hold the value of wildness itself, without any further justification. Others regard it as a ""rational ideal,"" or a logical consequence of their analysis regarding human folly, the problems with technical solutionism, etc. 

### 3. Acceptance of the imperative to rewild

From these values we derive a praxis with three elements: 

1. Conservation - we seek to conserve the wildness that remains
2. Rewilding - we seek to rewild areas where wildness has been lost
3. Reaction - we advocate and/or recognize the legitimacy of extreme, anti-progressive approaches to rewilding

The specifics of these ideas are as of yet unarticulated, because we have not come to definite conclusions ourselves. We do agree on a few thoughts, however: 

* Most of us recognize that in a clash between our values and the reality of our world, some amount of compromise is acceptable. These individuals (myself included) recognize the usefulness of conventional conservation strategies like wilderness protection or the endangered species act. 
* Conservation should prioritize wildness over biodiversity. 
* Most of us think [The Rewilding Program](http://www.wildlandsnetwork.org/wildways) proposed by The Wildlands Project is a useful idea. 
* We do not condemn violent or illegal reaction solely on the grounds that it is illegal or violent. It is, however, acceptable to condemn an action on the grounds that it is unstrategic or not in line with our values. 
* Condemnation and support is something individuals must choose to give themselves. Wildists have so far tended to mostly agree on these issues, but some have quite different feelings about, for example, the eco-extremists. This ties into the organizational principles of Wild Will, which emphasize autonomy and personal responsibility. 
* We unequivocally reject the so-called ""rewilding"" advocated by eco-modernists, which includes ideas like de-extinction and shuffling around species to ""fix"" ecosystems.

### Discourse

The purpose of wildism is to provide a very thin outline of core values that unite members of Wild Will (regardless of disagreements in other areas or particular applications of those values). The other purpose of wildism is to provide a consistent discourse to talk about those values. Not all people we associate with use the same terms, but it is at the very least necessary to understand them. Here are some useful definitions: 

* *Nature &amp; Artifice* - nature is the world not controlled or made by humans or their technical systems; artifice is the opposite, made and controlled. See [The Nature/Artifice Distinction](http://wildism.org/hg/article/the-nature-artifice-distinction/).

* *Wild* - not controlled by humans (the core quality of naturalness - see [The Nature/Artifice Distinction](http://wildism.org/hg/article/the-nature-artifice-distinction/))

* *The Cosmos/Reality/the material world* - everything that exists (see the bit on the naturalistic worldview)

* *The Idea of Progress* - the idea that civilization has improved, is improving, and will improve the human condition; progressivists are people who espouse the Idea of Progess. See [The Critique of Progress series](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/the-critique-of-progress).

* *Civilization* - the way of life based around cities

* *Ideology* - a connected set of ideas, values, and beliefs

* *Morality* - the rules that govern behavior

* *Technology* - material means of harnessing energy from nature; can apply to human as well as non-human animals

* *Technique* - methodological means of harnessing energy from nature; can apply to human as well as non-human animals

* *Technics* - the set of techniques, technologies, and engineering knowledge possessed by a society; alternatively, ""both techniques and technologies,"" i.e., ""biotechnics""

## Groups, Projects, and People

The main organization is the [Wild Will Coalition](http://wildism.org). 

My main project is [Hunter/Gatherer](http://wildism.org/hg/), a journal. 

/u/jeremygrolman runs [Blog for Wild Nature](http://forwildnature.org) and [Memes for Wild Nature](http://facebook.com/forwildnature). He also helps run websites associated with Wild Will and has also established several groups that study/investigate topics that we are trying to grasp, e.g., strategy or radical conservation history. 

Jonah is a fellow student at Chapel Hill who now runs [The Wildernist](http://thewildernist.org). 

I and a librarian student in the UK work on the [Archive of Radical Conservation History](http://wildism.org/rca/). 

I and /u/jeremygrolman run the /r/wildism subreddit and the [Against Civilization](http://facebook.com/groups/againstciv) Facebook group. 

Some academics, conservationists, and biologists espouse wildism but do not want to be public because of job-related fears. They help out with some ""intellectual labor"" by, for example, reviewing works for errors.

A group of students at my college, UNC - Chapel Hill, do local propaganda work, like speaking out against police bodycams, interacting with student organizations, giving speeches, hosting reading groups, etc.

Some people and projects we have working relationships with and/or support include: 

* [Marcellus Shale Earth First!](https://marcellusshaleearthfirst.org)

## FAQs

**How is this different from anarcho-primitivism?**

Some articles from the HG series [Critique of Anarcho-Primitivism](http://wildism.org/hg/article-tags/critique-of-anarcho-primitivism/) explain this. I recommend paying special attention to ""More Truths about Primitive Life,"" which will soon be published in the series. In a summary way, we can say that primitivists hold humanist values, while we advocate a variant of non-egalitarian egoism; they hold a view of human nature in line with traditional views in cultural anthropology, whereas our views align more with sociobiology; and they do not seem to advocate a specific praxis, whereas we generally agree on a few strategic questions, like the question of violence (we do not condemn it). 

**What are some important changes in the beliefs associated with wildism?**

The only real major change of note is the transition from a pro-revolutionary standpoint to one that encapsulates a broader and more realistic view of our strategic outlook. See ""[Revisiting Revolution](http://www.wildism.org/hg/1/6/revisiting-revolution)."" 

Also of note is a lessening emphasis on ""science."" This is a complicated issue that I can't explain here. Suffice it to say that I was pretty arrogant early on in the timeline that I gave above, and wrote about epistemological opinions hubristically. Listen to The Brilliant podcast's [recent critique of an old article](http://thebrilliant.org/podcast/episode-26-science/) I wrote on science to get a sense of what I mean. Note also that the emphasis on ""science"" has decreased because of differing opinions on the matter held by people the original core of Wild Will otherwise agreed with. No one rejects the accuracy of science (except in the way scientists might), but the term ""science"" is too ambiguous for people to know what we are talking about.

**How does wildism compare with anarchism?**

Wildism aligns with some forms of anarchism in being: 

* *Anti-state* -- this is not a specific focus, but it is implicit.
* *Anti-collectivist* -- we are individualists, and our views have been influenced by Stirner and Nietzsche. 
* *Anti-civilization* -- we reject civilization (way of life based on cities) so align with some aspects of anti-civ anarchism and primitivism

We do not align with anarchism in these ways: 

* *Social justice is not a concern* -- we are strongly critical of the notion of ""social justice"" and ""justice"" in general. 
* *Leftism* -- most forms of anarchism are left-wing (even most of the so-called post-left, a variant or child of the New Left), whereas wildism hosts many conservative members.

**What do wildists mean by ""morality""?**

Those belonging to Wild Will use the term ""morality"" broadly, ""the rules that govern behavior."" This includes law and traditional notions of morality, and it also includes principles (deontological or not) that individuals derive from their values. For example, if I do not kill an animal because I value it, regardless of whether I _like_ it or not, I have committed a moral act. 

It is possible to interpret wildism as an ""amoral"" philosophy, if one's definition of ""morality"" is highly restricted to notions of altruism or deontological or religious moral systems. However, because the purpose of wildism is to provide a generally-understood discourse to talk about what the members of Wild Will care about, we all generally use the broad definition. 

**What is the wildist position on population?**

Population matters. Different members have different opinions about specific issues pertaining to population, like how much emphasis the issue deserves or whether immigration policies are acceptable in the same way that the endangered species act might be considered acceptable. But accepting that overpopulation is an issue is axiomatic, and refusing to admit that overpopulation is a problem is a huge indicator that a person will disagree with many other aspects of wildism.

**What do wildists think about eco-extremists?**

Some strongly dislike them, some don't care or think they're irrelevant, some are pretty interested in the tendency and think they are provoking good questions. It's about evenly distributed. Perhaps predictably, all of the professionals who work with Wild Will hate them. 

**What do wildists think about Ted Kaczynski?**

His ideas have undoubtedly influenced the philosophy, but we've diverged from him in some important ways, and I should note that he doesn't like us, me in particular, at all. He does not want to be associated with us. All members of Wild Will agree with the main points I make in my essay about the man in [Ted Kaczynski and Why He Matters](http://dark-mountain.net/blog/ted-kaczynski-and-why-he-matters/), published on Dark Mountain.

The reductionist materialist answer seems to be in line with everything else we know and I can't identify any real problems with it. That is, why can't we just say that consciousness is a result of processes in the brain, and the sensation of ""consciousness"" specifically is an ""illusion"" of sorts? (Not the right word, but you get what I mean.)

Edit: I want to emphasize that I wrote ""(Not the right word, but you get what I mean.)"" 

Edit 2: I found [this article](http://www.livescience.com/366-great-minds-grasp-consciousness.html) which I read when I was reading up on the problem, and it expresses my problems: 

&gt; He wondered whether scientists would ever be able to measure the onset consciousness in infants and speculated that consciousness might be similar to what physicists call a ""phase transition,"" an abrupt and sudden large-scale transformation resulting from several microscopic changes. The emergence of superconductivity in certain metals when cooled below a critical temperature is an example of a phase transition.

and in regards to the idea that consciousness is a fundamental unit of the universe (which I now know is Chalmer's position--somehow hadn't read his article yet)

&gt; ""It's not very helpful,"" said Susan Greenfield, a professor of pharmacology at Oxford University.
&gt;
&gt; ""You can't do very much with it,"" Greenfield points out. ""It's the last resort, because what can you possibly do with that idea? You can't prove it or disprove it, and you can't test it. It doesn't offer an explanation, or any enlightenment, or any answers about why people feel the way they feel.""",askphilosophy,"Why is consciousness a ""hard problem""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/4vjh60/why_is_consciousness_a_hard_problem/

(FAQ says 10%, mod I spoke to said mods usually allow up to 30%.)

This isn't a huge problem because I've always hovered around about 30% naturally. But I have some questions about these spam rules. I know there is an FAQ and I've read it, but moderators tend to do a lot of interpretation of reddit rules so I'd like to know more what they think. 

**If I contribute to discussions across reddit but don't have much to _submit_ other than stuff from my website, is that spamming? The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_vote_cheating_and_vote_manipulation.3F) is only partially helpful about this:**

&gt; If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of submitting links to a site(s) that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, and additionally if you do not participate in discussion, or reply to peoples questions, regardless of how many upvotes your submissions get, you are a spammer. If over 10% of your submissions and conversation are your own site/content/affiliate links, you're almost certainly a spammer.

So do mods consider post _and_ comment history or just post history?

**Is it wrong to own a subreddit that is named the same as my website?**

This just makes sense to me, but one mod mentioned that it indicates spam to him. Is this true for all moderators or only in the context of the above rule? 

**Is it wrong to have a username that is the same as my website?**

Same as the above. My problem is unique in that the username and website are named after an ideology, and I chose ""wildism"" as the username before I decided I would use the account to submit stuff from wildism.org. 

Finally, **is there a better place to promote content in the manner that I have mistakenly been using reddit for**?

Thanks if you answer any of these questions. ",help,"Hi, I'm trying to ""de-spam"" my account and need some suggestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/4vhs75/hi_im_trying_to_despam_my_account_and_need_some/

Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.

And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.

This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it.

Ah … ! What’s happening? it thought.

Er, excuse me, who am I?

Hello?

Why am I here? What’s my purpose in life?

What do I mean by who am I?

Calm down, get a grip now … oh! this is an interesting sensation, what is it? It’s a sort of … yawning, tingling sensation in my … my … well I suppose I’d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let’s call it my stomach.

Good. Ooooh, it’s getting quite strong. And hey, what’s about this whistling roaring sound going past what I’m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that … wind! Is that a good name? It’ll do … perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I’ve found out what it’s for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What’s this thing? This … let’s call it a tail – yeah, tail. Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good can’t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn’t seem to achieve very much but I’ll probably find out what it’s for later on. Now – have I built up any coherent picture of things yet?

No.

Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I’m quite dizzy with anticipation …

Or is it the wind?

There really is a lot of that now isn’t it?

And wow! Hey! What’s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like … ow … ound … round … ground! That’s it! That’s a good name – ground!

I wonder if it will be friends with me?

And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.

Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now.",books,What are the funniest/most profound/most beautiful book quotes?,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4gnpl4/what_are_the_funniestmost_profoundmost_beautiful/

But I just can't see how this is coherent. Let me explain, and please respond if you think I'm missing something. 

Thing is, if we're making changes to ourselves, then we are doing so on the basis of what exists already, not what will exist. And at some point, that thing that we become will be something we couldn't even have comprehended before. So in what way can we say that we are in control? How can we say that we rationally decided the direction that our technical modifications could take us in? It seems more like we are ""going along for the ride"" with technology/nature. 

Does this make sense, or should I elaborate?

**EDIT:** Here's perhaps a helpful elaboration. Ignore it if it's confusing: 

*A* can imagine modifying himself so that he is *AB*. But once he is *AB*, he finds that he can imagine things up to *D* when before he could only see things up to *C*. Moreover, *AB* now finds that he senses a lot of sadness that he previously couldn't, and that's something he never could have guessed as *A*. So now, he decides to escape that sadness and modify himself to be *ABD*. How can we say that *A* took hold of his own evolution to become *ABD*? 

Also, how can we say that *A* improved nature when the source of his desires at least to become *AB* were _from_ nature? How can this be ""progress"" except in a retrospective sense?
