185,"An important point that I have not seen in this thread yet is that this ""documentary"" was used as a catalyst to create the corrupt, billionaire controlled government system that we see today. [Check this out!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) In the case the conservative lobbying group Citizens United wanted to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts in apparent violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (commonly known as the McCain–Feingold Act or ""BCRA"").[2] Section 203 of BCRA defined an ""electioneering communication"" as a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that mentioned a candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary, and prohibited such expenditures by corporations and unions. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that §203 of BCRA applied and prohibited Citizens United from advertising the film Hillary: The Movie in broadcasts or paying to have it shown on television within 30 days of the 2008 Democratic primaries.[1][3] The Supreme Court reversed this decision, striking down those provisions of BCRA that prohibited corporations (including nonprofit corporations) and unions from making independent expenditures and ""electioneering communications"".[2] The majority decision overruled Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990) and partially overruled McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003).",2015-08-14 19:52:00+00:00,cu35ark,1,t3_3gxcxk,64084,Documentaries
