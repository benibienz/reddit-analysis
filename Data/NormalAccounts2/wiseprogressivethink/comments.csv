1,"Pretty much. The fact that so many people have been willing to buy into this (literal) insanity is just more evidence of the power of the mass media and peer pressure. 

Trans people have a mental illness that causes them to seriously believe they are a different ""gender"" than they really are. And we are lectured endlessly that we must all agree with their delusions, lest we be declared bigots.

Schizophrenics also suffer from a mental illness. And there are schizophrenics out there who seriously believe that they hold in-depth conversations with their dogs, or believe they are the reincarnation of Napoleon, or believe they were sent by God to kill all the [fill in the blank]. But we aren't lectured on how we should agree with their delusions. No, we are told (correctly) that these are sick individuals who need psychiatric help. 

I don't ""hate"" a schizo just because I don't believe it when he says that he is from the future and communicates with the ghost of John Lennon.

I've been posting here for years. Long before Trump was running for anything. But lying is something Hillary's shills excel at. 

Trump didn't ""admit"" to anything. He was obviously joking, which is why the Bush idiot laughed right after he said it. CTR shills pretend that the concept of ""figure of speech"" is completely alien to them. Hey, stupid, if a guy says he's got such strong game that he's got ""bitches eating out of his hand,"" that does not mean that female dogs come by and he hand-feeds them kibble. If someone says he fucked the shit out of a gal, that doesn't mean she soiled the bed. Duh. 

Bill Clinton was credibly accused of rape by multiple women, and their accusations came out individually, over many years. But with Trump, suddenly - less than a month before the election - all these women come up with unprovable accusations of him kissing or touching them.

All. At. Once. Three. Weeks. Before. An. Election. 

This is too obvious. Especially the timing of the release of the video (right before the debate) and Anderson Cooper's obvious set-up question at the debate. WikiLeaks has proven that the media is rigged, so there was obviously some coordination going on there. The tape was known about months before it was released. Time enough to line up some left-wing women to make these claims to help elect a Democrat.

If you're in a group of people who are all new to each other (think first day of classes at college), everyone will be apprehensive. It's human nature. But if you go into that very first day with some social confidence and gregariousness, you sort of instantly become a leader, an alpha by default. Introduce yourself to others, volunteer your comments, etc. Other people (both male and female) will sort of begin to look up to you. 

First impressions matter, and you only get one shot at it. 

Now, remember this tidbit every time you do an approach in public. Same shit applies. Both parties will be a bit nervous, but by virtue of the fact that you were the one taking the initiative, you're already sort of ""in charge.""

633,"Off-topic:

I go on Reddit almost every day, and have done so for at least the last two years. Because of this, I have noticed something, and I bet you have too. 

When Bernie was running against Hillary and still had a shot at the nomination, /r/politics was full of massively up-voted articles that were highly critical of Hillary, including articles from conservative sites like Daily Caller, Breitbart, and FoxNews.com. There were even some articles that were pro-Trump that were up-voted. 

Starting pretty much the moment Bernie dropped out and endorsed Hillary, there has been almost nothing on /r/politics that is critical of Hillary. Anti-Hillary submissions from right-leaning sites are down-voted into oblivion and the comments are full of attacks on the source. Even submissions from establishment media sources that are critical of Hillary are usually down-voted. Anti-Trump articles comprise the vast majority of heavily up-voted submissions now. 

I have to ask two questions. First, do /r/politics regulars not notice this, or do they just not care? The subreddit went from hugely anti-Hillary to hugely pro-Hillary almost overnight. Surely I'm not the only person capable of pattern recognition. This is obviously an example of a medium being utilized for open political propaganda. I mean, /r/Conservative was pretty anti-Trump during the primaries, and it remains pretty negative about Trump. /r/conspiracy was strongly anti-Hillary during the primaries, and remains so. Those subs didn't do a complete 180 overnight. But /r/politics did. Seems pretty...interesting.

Second, what explains this almost instantaneous flip-flop? Did Bernie Bros really completely change their minds about Hillary in the span of like a week? Are the mods of /r/politics rigging the system? Or the admins of Reddit? Or has there been a massive influx of CTR paid shills who are gaming one of Reddit's largest subs in order to turn it into 24/7 propaganda for a particular candidate? And if that's the case, why are the mods and admins silent? That would seem to be a noteworthy scandal... ",2016-08-24 01:24:25+00:00,d6u37qo,1.0,t3_4z6e7f,43713.0,uncensorednews

638,"It's two different strategies, and I see them both as useful.

Strategy 1 - Call this Death By A Thousand Cuts. Point out the obvious lies of the Left, like that a mentally ill man magically becomes a woman the moment he puts on a skirt and demands you call him ""Tina."" It's relatively easy to red pill someone on a single issue like that, but the reward is fairly minimal. That's because the target will see that the Left has told a lie, but he may dismiss it as a relatively minor outlier example. So you need to keep hammering him with other examples  in order to demonstrate the larger pattern. Very time consuming. 

Strategy 2 - Call this the Hail Mary. Attempt to red pill a normie by striking at the root of the problem. ""Jews control the media and lie about everything, even the Holocaust, for the benefit of themselves!"" Chances of success are minimal (you'll most likely be dismissed as a kook and lose all credibility with the normie). But if successful, the target could become instantly red pilled on pretty much everything.

What if the reason Mormons are so pro-Muslim immigration (and therefore anti-Trump) is because they know that if enough Muslims enter the country, there will eventually be a push for legalized polygamy, and if it's a bunch of brown immigrants pushing for it, the Left will feel obligated to support it, and if the Left supports it, the (((media))) will support it, and if the (((media))) supports it, then it will likely be successful.

Reuters/Ipsos conducted a national poll. They asked respondents who they would vote for in the presidential election. When they offered only Hillary and Trump as choices, Hillary ended up ahead of Trump by a 40% to 35% margin. Okay, fair enough. 

Then they asked *these same respondents* (I'm assuming) the same question again, but this time included Jill Stein and Gary Johnson as options. 

One would expect, by offering these additional choices, that some number of the Hillary and Trump supporters would name either Johnson or Stein as their pick instead, and therefore it logically follows that both Hillary's and Trump's numbers would decrease a bit. 

But that's not what happened.  

Hillary's numbers went down a little from 40% to 37%, which makes sense. But Trump's numbers went **up** somehow from 35% to 37%. How is that possible?

782,"tl;dw version: 

Hillary has a long history of positioning herself as an environmentalist. The Keystone Pipeline was opposed by the vast majority of environmentalists. 

Almost immediately after Hillary was announced to be Obama's pick for Secretary of State in 2008, TD Bank Investment Group paid her husband Bill Clinton nearly two million dollars in exchange for giving ten speeches in Canada. That's about $200,000 per speech. He had never been offered paid speeches by this organization before. This organization stood to make a lot of money if the Keystone Pipeline was approved. Hillary's State Department had wide discretion over whether or not the pipeline would receive final approval based on an environmental impact report, and her State Department more or less gave it a thumbs-up, which was shocking to many environmentalists and seemed to run counter to her stated concerns about Global Climate Change and the need to move beyond fossil fuels.

793,"&gt; I don't see any evidence that, for example, this doesn't happen with Republican interviews.

Ah, so evidence of prearranging questions with a Democrat candidate (without informing the viewing audience of this arrangement) isn't a story because there is an absence of evidence that they weren't prearranging questions with a Republican candidate as well.

That's a fascinating standard. 

So, say, when Republican Congressman Mark Foley was caught sexually harassing teenage Congressional pages, I guess it wasn't really a story because there was no proof that Congressional pages weren't also being sexually harassed by Democrat congressmen.

And when conservative Armstrong Williams was found to have received payments from Dubya's administration to push NCLB, I suppose that wasn't really a story because there was no proof that the Clinton administration had never paid any liberals to push an agenda.

Here's a thought: Maybe treat this scoop as a story, and do a little digging, ask some people some questions - you know, journalist stuff. Then, if you can verify that CNN has coordinated with the RNC for Republican candidates as well, report the story with that information included. Don't just assume there's no fire when there's smoke.

839,"So much could be said about this...but it's late, so I'll offer just a couple thoughts. 

For one, the cops appeared to be more aggressive than usual in preventing these particular protesters from stopping traffic, probably because these protesters were white (aggressively arresting large numbers of blacks for blocking a road would very likely lead to physical confrontations that would be aired live to the world via CNN, possibly sparking further race riots...whereas getting aggressive with some stupid white SJWs doesn't carry that same risk). This would seem to sorta undermine the entire ""police are evil white racists targeting and harassing blacks for no reason"" premise of the BLM movement. 

Second, these ""planned"" protests appear to attract your more peaceful white SJW type of protester. The majority-black ""protests"" we've been seeing so much of recently are in reality just spontaneous riots that occur immediately after a media-hyped police shooting, because mindless black rage. 

In summary, even when anti-white blacks and anti-white whites are unified in their cause, HBD rears its ugly head once again. ",2016-07-17 04:43:17+00:00,d5fbnaf,1.0,t3_4t5329,46408.0,altright

893,"You are apparently arguing against a straw man. I never said that illegals are necessarily more likely than others to commit crime. I simply pointed out the fact that many illegals have committed serious crimes, like rape and murder. Therefore, Trump's statement was factually correct. 

Also, note, that if these illegals hadn't been in the country in the first place (because of a border wall, or because of a strong internal enforcement system, or because of a combination of policies) that the state of Texas alone would have had **1,042 fewer homicides and 5,445 fewer sexual assaults** over just the past five years. 

Those are real people we're talking about, man. Actual human beings, not just numbers on a screen. Your fellow citizens are being raped and murdered by people whose first act upon entering the country was to violate federal law. One candidate views this as a problem to be dealt with; the other candidate thinks the status quo is just great. 

Edit: I'll also note that you threw in some red herrings. Trump's statement was specifically about rapists and, in later comments, murderers. He didn't highlight robbers or thieves. So if you were to be intellectually honest, you would remove robbery and theft from your numbers. That would leave you with the following data:

&gt;Illegal aliens are: 

&gt;1.6% *less* likely to commit sexual assault than the average Texan 

&gt;6.0% *more* likely to commit murder than the average Texan 

Which does't exactly comport with your conclusion that:

&gt;Illegal aliens are statistically less dangerous than the rest of Texas.

But even if true, the only acceptable number of *illegal* immigrant crimes is zero. That's because none of them should be here in the first place.

I'll try to explain this like you're five. With a wide-open border, *anyone* can enter the country without having gone through the vetting process that legal immigrants must go through.

Some of us find that, uh, problematic. 

The only acceptable number of violent crimes committed by illegal aliens is zero. This is because *they shouldn't be here in the first place*. 

So it's kind of a problem when people invade your country and commit horrific crimes against your citizens. Or at least, a lot of Americans feel that it's a problem. Some, it appears, don't much care when foreigners enter the country illegally and rape or murder their fellow citizens, because, hey, some American citizens commit rape and murder, too, so what's the big deal?

* Pence is a Governor and has experience as a high-ranking Congressman, so he's got both practical executive experience in government as well as knowledge of how things (such as actual legislation instead of simply policy proposals) work in DC. 

* Trump should win Indiana regardless of who his running mate is, but Pence is from the Midwest, so in theory that could help Trump in bordering states like Ohio and Michigan.

- St. John's Wort 3 X / Day (assuming you're not already on SSRIs or something). 

- Get your T level checked (assuming you have some sort of insurance or access to a doctor). If it's low, start getting the shots. 

- Lift.

- Get a job. Yeah, the economy sucks, but there's always *something* available. Mow lawns. Wash cars. Whatever. Preferably something physical and relatively mindless (so ideally you can listen to books on tape while you work).

- If your current surroundings/environment are a net negative in your life, move if possible. It's easier to ""start fresh"" if you're in a new location. 

- Lie about being a virgin when the subject comes up IRL (to both men and women). 

- Lose your virginity ASAP. This first sexual act will likely be something of an awkward debacle. Expect that. Just remember that you'll only improve with experience. Find a fat pig on a dating website or pay a whore if necessary. Your status as a virgin will continue to be a mental roadblock to your personal advancement until it is removed. So, remove it.

1143,"Can confirm that speaking loudly (certainly not shouting, but not mumbling or letting your words trail off as you finish a sentence) is a very easy and effective way to appear to be more alpha/confident. 

Years ago, I received a promotion where I would be interacting frequently with important people at businesses that our company had agreements with. I was nervous about the requirements of this new position, so I read a couple self-help books in this area. There was a lot of stuff I read that I either didn't use or that I tried to use but it didn't seem to be all that helpful, but speaking loudly and clearly was definitely a useful tip. 

Also, showing up at a bar alone and just watching the TV sounds sort of pathetic and can be a bit scary for the socially-awkward, but this also works. The people around you will mostly be buzzed, so their inhibitions will be lowered and they'll be in a good mood. People who are in a good mood and have lowered inhibitions are likely to strike up a friendly conversation with a stranger (in this case, you). Just make sure you have a reasonable backstory for why you are there (""I really wanted to watch the ballgame but I don't have cable and my buddies were busy tonight"" works) and be friendly yourself.

1151,"I know teachers. I was a student for quite a while, so I got to know dozens of them from that angle. Then a couple of my best friends became teachers, so I gained a perspective on the profession from that angle. And then I dated a teacher for a couple years who was close friends with a couple other teachers who would hang out at our place all the time. So I got to know the day-to-day life of a teacher pretty darn intimately.

So I know teachers pretty well and have been around them literally all my life, but because I've never myself been a teacher I feel I can be reasonably objective about them.

Here's the bottom line: So long as you A) like kids and B) don't have a problem with daily public speaking, it's a cake job with decent pay, excellent job security, benefits, and retirement, and tons of time off. (And if you don't meet criteria A and B, you won't be a teacher for very long.)

Teachers complain about how hard their jobs are and how they are underpaid because...*everyone* complains about how hard their jobs are and how they are underpaid. There exists no profession in which the people in that profession do not complain about their jobs. Movie stars complain about their jobs. Pro athletes complain about their jobs. I'm willing to bet that male porn stars - guys who were born with big dicks and who get paid to fuck different hot women every day - have no shortage of gripes when talking about their job among their peers. 

As to the OP, I don't know you or where you work or any of that. But I do know that plenty of teachers go home shortly after their students do. And plenty of teachers take a lot of (paid) time off while some clueless substitute is thrown at their students, fully aware that the kids will be learning absolutely nothing that day. Plenty of teachers declare a random day ""movie day"" and turn on some film that is just barely relevant to the class they are teaching simply so that they can use the time to catch up on their grading outside of their planning hours without having to take their work home with them. 

Average starting salary for a teacher fresh out of university with just her Bachelor's degree is $36,000/year. This is the least she will ever make. If she pursues a Master's degree, she will get a significant salary increase. Her tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt will be completely forgiven after ten years of teaching. Teachers get paid extra for teaching summer school or coaching a team. Teachers who start their career while in their 20s can usually retire with a full pension while still in their 50s. 

2+ months off every summer (yeah, you might have to go to a week-long seminar during your vacation). 4 days off for Thanksgiving. 2 weeks off for Christmas/New Years. 1 week off for spring break. Every weekend off (yes, occasionally there might be a Saturday where you have to ""work"" for a few hours). Lots of paid sick days, vacation days, personal days. You work indoors in a climate-controlled environment. You get a laptop/notebook/tablet to take home. You are very unlikely to lose your job unless you abuse drugs or abuse your students. You work in an industry that is never going to become obsolete. You are eligible for good health/dental benefits that are relatively affordable. (Did I mention 2+ months off for summer every year?) 

And then of course you get praised almost endlessly in the media for being literally heroic, just for showing up for work. 

But heaven forbid someone publicly state a differing opinion about teachers, that perhaps they aren't literal superheroes but instead are - usually - intellectual mediocrities who make a fair salary and have a relatively cushy job. When that happens, every teacher on the planet simultaneously cries out in pain as if struck across the face with a spiked club.

1166,"Adam may very well have Asperger's, and Drew has even suggested as much (though not to Adam's face, so far as I'm aware...I think I recall Drew saying that on a podcast being guest-hosted by that the guy who used to host Entertainment Tonight or something). 

Adam is also pretty obviously an alcoholic, and Drew has declined to tell him so to his face when given the opportunity to do so. (Drew's response, as I recall from a podcast a year or so ago, was that so long as Adam was functioning, the nightly boozing wasn't really a problem, and if it wasn't a problem, then it wasn't alcoholism. Well...no. Drew simply described a *functional* alcoholic, not a non-alcoholic.)

Drew clearly fears Adam to some extent, either because of Adam's temper and ranting, or because he doesn't want to lose the friendship and podcast (or both). In any case, Drew is unlikely to lead any sort of intervention, even though he pretty much has an ethical obligation to do so.

As for Asperger's itself, the way I see it, men in general tend to think in a more cold, logical and rational manner, while women tend to think in a more emotional manner that is mostly concerned about consensus and keeping the peace than about objective right-and-wrong or abstract principles. Say the average man thinks 70% logically and 30% emotionally, while the average woman thinks 70% emotionally and 30% logically. Guys with Asperger's (and it *is* mostly men who have it) are even more unbalanced in their logic-to-emotion ratio, say 90% to 10%. Guys like Drew, on the other hand, think more closely to the way the average woman thinks (say he's 45-55).

Be different, be funny, use double entendre, paint a picture with your words (use adjectives). Most of the ads on CL have poor spelling, poor syntax, misuse of punctuation, etc. Make sure to proofread your ad before submitting and format it to be readable. Your ad will stand out from the crowd if you do these things. 

Edit: Here's a random example of a real (and fairly typical) CL ad:

&gt;Headline: Kik me - m4w (Orlando) 
&gt;
&gt;Body: Any women want to chat with me on kik. It doesn't have to lead to anything but just chatting. I am a 25 year old Caucasian male. My kik is &gt;f********6

Approximately zero effort went into this ad. The odds of anyone other than a bushpig, a scammer, or a homosexual man responding to this ad are pretty much nil. 

If he'd had a more original headline, typed two or three paragraphs for the body, used larger words to paint an interesting picture of himself (he could use a thesaurus if he doesn't have a particularly wide vocabulary), and threw in a little bit of humor, he'd have a lot better chance of getting a decent response or two.

1179,"My perspective, FWIW:

Trump will get a slightly higher % of the black vote than Romney or McCain got, because Obama's not on the ticket. And black voter turnout will be down from 2008 and 2012 somewhat...also because Obama's not on the ticket. So, win-win for Trump.

Trump will lose badly with Hispanics, but no worse than Romney did in 2012. Hispanic turnout will be a bit higher, but Hispanic voters tend to be concentrated in places where a Republican either can't win (California) or can't lose (Texas). Minimal impact.

Trump will do worse with women than Romney did, but better with men (because Hillary is hated by most men, including many Democrat men). So the gender gap will be even bigger, but it cuts both ways.

Independents went narrowly for Romney in 2012, and they will go solidly for Trump (who is an outsider) over Hillary (who is the ultimate insider) this year. 

Turnout among working class whites will be WAY up over 2012, and they will be considerably more likely to vote for Trump than they did for Romney. This advantage will be offset somewhat by a higher percentage of suburban middle class white voters supporting Hillary (or voting third party, or staying home) than supported Obama in 2012. But Trump will reap the benefits of appealing to the white working class in Electoral College-rich swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. (Particularly if he picks Kasich as his running mate, which I think is likely.) 

There is more enthusiasm among the voters for Trump than there is for Hillary, as seen in the primary turnout.

Trump could win New Hampshire, which is full of independent voters who are part of the white working class but aren't all that religious or socially conservative.

Trump should win Florida, which has a huge population of old white retirees who are drawn to his ""Make America Great Again"" message because they aren't fond of all the fairly radical changes that have taken place during the Obama administration (that Hillary wants to embrace and expand on).

All this adds up to a fairly close election that could see Trump winning all the usual red states plus Florida, Ohio, perhaps Michigan, perhaps Pennsylvania, and perhaps New Hampshire. Oh, and maybe even Iowa, Colorado, Nevada, and a congressional district in Maine. 

This is pretty much a best-case scenario for Trump, and it's unlikely to all fall into place for him...but if it did (and it's not at all impossible), here's what the Electoral College map would look like on Election Day - http://i.imgur.com/WAPbImm.png

If you *don't* back down, she leaves you and takes half your shit and your standard of living goes into the crapper and she takes your children physically from you and you have to pay through the nose for the privilege of having your own offspring raised by a woman who hates you until they are 18 or graduate from high school (whichever happens later, natch).

That being said, in our current degenerate society, AWALT. I haven't taken her up on her offer thus far, but even if I don't, she's almost certainly going to be fucking a man other than her husband in the near future (if she hasn't already). He's not giving her what she wants, and she knows she can easily get it from somewhere else. 

I could write her a lengthy email or series of texts chiding her for what she's considering doing, but all that would do is cause her hamster to dismiss me as a rude asshole and she'd just look elsewhere for strange cock. So I'm not really in a position to be able dissuade her from the course of action she's planning on taking.

In a better world, women wouldn't act like this. Or, if they did, they'd be shunned for doing so and become absolute social pariahs, and their husbands would be given one free closed-fist punch to their faces and then get custody of the kids, and then the women would have to pay child support to their ex-husbands. But we all know that's not how the world really works, at least not in the vast majority of cases, at least not in the West, at least not in The Current Year. 

In the real world, she is going to be fucking a man other than her husband within a matter of days, and she will either get away with it; or she'll get caught and then turn it around to be her husband's fault for neglecting her and pushing her away and he'll cry and apologize and try to be an even better beta bux provider in the future; or she'll get caught and he'll leave her, but she'll get the kids in the divorce and he'll be living alone in a studio apartment struggling to pay child support while he grapples with a crippling case of depression caused by his slut wife's betrayal. 

I suppose the more honorable thing to do is filter out all married women. I agree with that in principle. But they're still going to find a willing cock to ride no matter how many RP guys deny them. So the end result will be the same, only it will be some other dude who's getting his dick wet.

Good post, but it should be pointed out that Trump is not for conservatives only. He can be expected to get the support of moderates who think the Democrat Party has gone too far left. He will get the support of America First nationalists. His foreign policy appeals to paleo-cons and is something that libertarians should consider as the lesser of two evils when compared to Hillary's foreign policy. He appeals to apolitical working class voters who like an outsider and enjoy rooting for the underdog. Low-information voters who only know him from his TV show are a potentially sizable voting block. 

Trump is expanding the party. His appeal is broad. He doesn't meet everyone's criteria for a True Conservative, but he could possibly turn a number of Blue states Red in November.

1299,"Eh, it's more complicated than that. Police are required to make an arrest at a DV call if there is any indication that someone physically harmed someone else. So it's not so much that they are white knighting as that they are following their department's procedures. (And many individual police officers don't agree with these procedures, which were basically written by feminists, but their hands are tied.)

A common scenario: A guy just had a huge fight with his live-in girlfriend. They've both been drinking. She accused him of cheating (maybe correctly, maybe not), he denied it, she didn't believe him and then started throwing random insults at him to push his buttons (you have a small dick, I fake my orgasms, I'm gonna fuck your brother/cousin/friend/coworker, etc.), he lost his cool and slapped her or pushed her to the ground, and so she called the cops. 

Now the police have showed up and by now the situation is calmer, but still not exactly calm. This guy is still drunk, doesn't want to go to jail, doesn't want to admit to a stranger (who is an authority figure) that he just assaulted a woman, etc. There's a lot of cross-talk and lying from both the man and the woman when the police arrive and ask their questions as they try to determine what actually happened. 

At this point, the guy's spidey-sense warns him (probably accurately) that he's about to be arrested, his woman is going to leave him, he's going to be in tomorrow's papers as a wife-beating scumbag, he's going to lose his job, he's going to be spending some time in jail, and then doing community service, and then on probation, all while the woman he loves fucks other guys and tells everyone what an asshole he is. Despite his drunken state, his immediate future is revealed to him in a moment of clarity. He loses his shit again and tries to flee. The police chase/tackle him. Given the adrenaline dump he's experiencing, he's in pure fight/flight mode now, so he attacks the police hoping to escape. If there is a weapon handy, maybe he tries to use it. And then you have suicide-by-cop. (And obviously the officers could be hurt or killed in this scenario too.)

1378,"This is just yet another example of ""no platforming"" in action. 

No platforming occurs when an individual or group that is hated by the SJWs (so, basically anyone who is right of center or has a single ""controversial"" politically incorrect opinion about anything) is invited to speak somewhere. 

No platforming Step One is to try to apply pressure through typical cry-bully tactics to get the event cancelled or the targeted speaker dis-invited. 

If that fails, Step Two is for hordes of protesters show up outside the venue in an effort to block entrance to the event, to harass attendees, and to possibly sabotage the event (pulling fire alarms, calling in bomb threats, etc.). 

Step Three is for SJWs to infiltrate the event and then disrupt it by periodically interrupting the speaker(s), screaming obscenities, occasionally attempting to attack the speaker or the attendees, etc. 

And here's the really important lesson to take home from this: Even if the SJWs fail in all three areas (the speaker isn't dis-invited and the event isn't cancelled; attendees are allowed entry to the venue; and the speaker is able to finish his/her remarks relatively unmolested), the chaos surrounding the event makes it less likely that the speaker will be invited to (or allowed to participate in) future events, because most college officials simply don't want to deal with all the drama. So even in failure, the SJWs win because of the overall chilling effect it places on the speech they disapprove of.

They've done the same thing to Trump at his events. They do it to anyone they don't like. And they aren't going to stop, because it's working for them. ",2016-04-28 18:56:43+00:00,d2l1oqr,1.0,t3_4gt9s1,33162.0,TheRedPill

Teenagers who aren't all that interested in fancy book learnin' shouldn't feel obligated to get themselves into $50,000 or $100,000 of nondischargeable student loan debt in order to spend four (or five, or six...) years getting a degree in something they don't really have much interest in, especially if such a degree is not likely to lead to a high-paying job (IOW, most non-STEM degrees).

Those people should instead be strongly encouraged to go to vocational school and get certified in something useful, or else learn a trade. Mike Rowe is absolutely right when he talks about this issue. There are countless people out there who never even set foot on a college campus but who are making close to six-figure salaries by their 30s simply by learning a trade, working hard, and excelling at it. I'm not even talking about small business owners or entrepreneurs. Their jobs might not be ""fun"" but they pay well and there isn't a shortage of work. 

Also, bullshit degrees like women's studies, black studies, etc, should lose state funding. If a private school wants to offer them, great. But the taxpayer shouldn't be on the hook for a program of study that doesn't teach the students anything other than how to resent other people and play the victim.

One was that they could surrender, have a lot of their shit taken and have a lot of their young men impressed into his military force while a lot of their young virgin girls became concubines of GK and his top lieutenants. 

*Or*, they could fight against GK's forces, almost certainly lose, have **all** the men either killed in battle or executed immediately afterwards, have their women raped and murdered, have their girls turned into sex slaves for entertainment/breeding, and have their boys used as forced labor and worked to death. 

Given those two choices, and given GK's overall reputation and track record of winning military victories, a lot of cities just let his forces in to pillage and plunder. The residents of those cities were allowed to live, but some of their number would be compelled to join with GK for labor, as fuck-toys, and to replenish his military ranks.

1503,"Once upon a time, little girls had fathers. Not sperm donors they barely got to know, but actual fathers. Those fathers, being adult men, felt a moral obligation to spend time and energy instilling lessons in their female offspring. Lessons imply teaching. Teaching implies right and wrong answers. Little girls learned lessons from their fathers via teaching, and thereby learned right from wrong. Right was to be feminine, respectful, and chaste; wrong was to be slovenly, selfish, and bereft of honor. 

Then, the Big Bad Wolf LBJ came along, had JFK killed and smeared Goldwater, and in doing so became a very powerful man. He used his power to make fathers superfluous, and replaced them with The State. Once fathers were replaced by The State, mothers were incentivized to raise their offspring alone. Mothers, being female, were generally incapable of instilling lessons in their offspring, because lessons imply teaching, and teaching implies a knowledge of right and wrong, and females - left to their own devices - have great difficulty discerning right from wrong because their opinions on the matter tend to change with their hormonal cycles and their particular immediate circumstances. So a generation of little girls were raised without vitally important fundamental lessons being instilled in them. (This was truly the beginning of a Great Society!)

This generation of little girls eventually grew to become Women. And these Women were unable to discern Right from Wrong because those lessons had never been instilled in them. And whenever they made a Wrong choice, they managed to escape punishment, either via an abortion or a welfare check or a child support payment or an alimony judgment, or some combination thereof. Having been artificially shielded from the negative effects of Wrong choices, there was no longer much incentive to make Right choices. This generation also had female offspring, increasingly without fathers. A snowball effect ensued. 

In The Current Year, it's a coin flip whether or not a little girl who is in the process of becoming a Woman has ever had a father around to instill any important life lessons in her. As a result, it's also a coin flip whether or not a little boy who is in the process of becoming a Man will end up being falsely accused of rape, or be cuckolded and wind up supporting a child who he doesn't know is not really his, or be divorce-raped and lose half of his worldly possessions while simultaneously being put on the hook for up to 18 years of ""child support"" payments that in actuality go towards paying for mommy's mani-pedis and bar tab. 

This is our reality, in The Current Year. We didn't make this world, but we've gotta live in it. TRP provides a rough map for how to navigate through this mess.

* Demanding that openly homosexual adult men be allowed to escort young boys into secluded wooded areas for sleeping in tents without their parents overnight

* Demanding that mentally-ill men who wear dresses be allowed to have unfettered access to women's bath rooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms, where women - including underage girls - necessarily will get naked and engage in deeply private activities

Sixty years ago, they would have had their teeth kicked in for suggesting such policies. Today, it's considered mainstream opinion, and if you publicly dissent you are at high risk of having your reputation and career destroyed.

&gt; It's fucked up that you think you get to decide someone's identity and gender for them

I don't get to decide. Mother Nature already did, what with the whole penis and testicles and Y chromosome in every one of his body's cells. (Why do you hate science?)

Names can be changed. Chromosomes cannot.

&gt; Mental illness is not a joke.

I agree. For instance, when a schizophrenic says that he's Napoleon, I don't find anything funny about that. And I certainly don't humor him by agreeing that he is Napoleon, and demanding that the government pass laws that enable him to ride around on a horse all day while commanding an army and using cannon on his enemies.

There is also no doubt that having children is what we, as a species, are designed to do.

1639,"So there are 11 characters in the woods:

*Rick, Glenn, Daryl, Michonne, Maggie, Rosita, Aaron, Sasha, Abraham, Carl, and Eugene.*

I have a difficult time believing that the writers will have Negan beat one of the women to death by caving her skull in with a barbed baseball bat. So that leaves:

*Rick, Glenn, Daryl, Aaron, Abraham, Carl, and Eugene.* 

I take it from Negan's threat to cut out Carl's remaining eye and feed it to Rick if anyone made any noise that it's not Rick or Carl either. (Think about it.) So that leaves:

*Glenn, Daryl, Aaron, Abraham, and Eugene.*

Negan's comment that his victim is taking it ""like a champ"" would seem to eliminate Eugene, who is a sniveling coward, so the idea of him taking a brutal beating like that bravely would be completely out of character. So that leaves:

*Glenn, Daryl, Aaron, and Abraham.*

Glenn already got his ass kicked a little bit, so I think it would be sort of redundant for him to be targeted again. So that leaves:

*Daryl, Aaron, and Abraham.* 

We just had the cliffhanger of Daryl being shot, so I don't think the writers would immediately put his life in jeopardy again. So that leaves:

*Abraham and Aaron.* 

Would the writers really kill off Abraham, possibly the most likable and popular character at the moment, and one who is just starting an interesting new relationship in which he's talking about having a baby with his new girlfriend? They might...but my money is on Aaron getting the brain batting practice. He's a relatively minor character who got a good amount of screen-time in the season finale (the writers usually like to give their doomed characters a lot of attention right before killing them off). Plus, he's a gay man, and so the idea that he's ""taking it like a champ"" could be a little bit of PC leaking in to the writing (gotta show that gay men can be unbelievably tough, just like the hetero guys Daryl, Abraham, and Rick). So:

**Aaron**

Not at all. But ""entitlement reform"" (aka slashing government benefits for millions of recipients) isn't a winning issue to run on in a general election. (Just ask Vice President Paul Ryan.)

And it's sort of important to win the election, since you can't implement your policies without first holding office. In order to win elections, it's rather vital to appeal to a large number of people. Promising millions of people that they will have to pay more and get less in return (quasi-austerity) isn't real popular with the public. 

If, however, a candidate appeals to these people by saying that he won't touch entitlements, and thereby wins their votes, and thereby wins the election, then once in office he is free to cobble together a bipartisan Grand Compromise on entitlement reform. (Pro-Tip: Sometimes candidates for high office tell lies in order to get elected. See: Obama, Barack Hussein and Clinton, William Jefferson. They do that because, get this, it works.)

1714,"&gt; America isn't a ""white"" country

It was founded pretty much exclusively by white men. Look it up.

&gt; Blacks were here before most whites immigrated.

Black people have always been a minority of the population. White people have always been the majority of the population since the founding of this country.

&gt; Also, it was full of red natives long before that.

The continent was, but the country has always been majority-white. Native Americans were a small percentage of the population of the 13 colonies in 1776. 

&gt; But you should probably check your casual racism.

Aww, a SJW! How cute! 

It's simple logic, really. If living in a majority-white country is just so awful, one has every right and reason to wonder why people who feel this way don't simply emigrate to a nonwhite country. There are dozens and dozens to choose from. There is no fence or wall keeping her here. She is free to leave at any time and seek out a better life in Zimbabwe or Haiti. So why doesn't she? Why does she choose to remain in this awful country surrounded by evil white devils who are constantly oppressing her? Seems...odd.

It is simply stated as a matter of fact, and the reader is expected to accept it as such (particularly since it helps make the case for the character who is telling the truth in the story).

Authors have long been known to shoehorn their own opinions into their stories by putting them in the mouths of the characters they write about (Orwell is said to have done this with his Emmanuel Goldstein character in Nineteen Eighty-Four, as just one example).

1780,"&gt; tweeted some words that a long-dead dictator once said?

Even that's not really accurate. Trump retweeted an old Italian proverb ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-29/from-mussolini-s-slogan-to-trump-s-soundbite ) that was popularized by the Italian military back in 1918 during WWI. It's an objectively inspiring quote - *""It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.""* But Mussolini also happened to use the quote at some point, so the establishment media got to scream FASCIST!!!1!1! 

And that was all part of the plan. You see, the person who is running the twitter account that Trump retweeted is a leftist troll from Gawker ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-29/from-mussolini-s-slogan-to-trump-s-soundbite ) who has been bombarding Trump's twitter account with cool-sounding quotes that do not name the people who originated or popularized the quotes, hoping that Trump will retweet them. ( Check out the twitter account for yourself - https://twitter.com/ilduce2016 ) The quotes are all ""gotcha"" quotes that were said at some point by dictators and other assorted bad guys of history. So as soon as Trump unknowingly retweeted a ""fascist"" quote, the biased media sprung into action to make it national news.

The media are very dishonest people.

And actually, a very similar version of the quote - *""Better to live one day as a tiger than a thousand years as a sheep""* - originated in India over 200 years ago from Tipu Sahib, the sultan of Mysore ( http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199539536.001.0001/acref-9780199539536-e-156 ).

So this is a complete non-story that only became a story because a left-wing journalist trolled Trump's twitter account in order to create a story out of thin air, and then his leftist colleagues in the establishment media went about using this non-story to push the narrative that Trump is somehow a dangerous guy.

And yes, members of the media do in fact conspire to create stories and then push them in order to create and nurture a narrative that helps Democrats and hurts Republicans ( http://hotair.com/archives/2010/07/20/daily-caller-discovers-journolist-plot-to-spike-wright-story-smear-conservatives-as-racists/ ).",2016-03-17 17:41:15+00:00,d13hm40,2.0,t1_d13f4xm,3331.0,Conservative

&gt; Todd Akin, who said there was such a thing as ‘legitimate rape'

If she was going to attack him for what he actually meant, in context, she'd be denouncing him for thinking that some rapes **aren't** ""legitimate."" 

Instead she takes the phrase out of context to make it appear that he wanted to legitimize the crime of rape.

&gt; And how exactly did providing the context make this any better?

If you actually read what I wrote (along with the linked article) and you honestly can't see how she has taken a single failed candidate's statement, taken it out of context, twisted it, made it sound ten times worse, and then dishonestly conflated this one man's gaffe with the platform of an entire political party, then I'm afraid I cannot help you.

1797,"Her most egregious out-of-context quote is this one:

&gt;  ""...candidates like Todd Akin, who said there was such a thing as ‘legitimate rape'...""

That is so horrendously misleading, I'm actually overawed at how utterly without scruples the DNC is.

The context of the Todd Akin quote is this: He was asked about his opposition to allowing women who have been raped to get an abortion. While this is a pretty dogmatic position to take on the issue, it's a position that is shared by many mainstream pro-life Republicans, including (for example) Marco Rubio. However, it's an unpopular position with the public generally, which is why the biased media love to bring this subject up as much as possible.

Anyway, Akin's response was based on some strange pseudo-scientific understanding of human reproduction, which  just by itself was bad enough. He said, basically, that if a woman is a victim of rape, her body would somehow naturally prevent the rapist's sperm from fertilizing her egg or something. It was a pretty bizarre statement for a U.S. Senate candidate to make, and of course it's not accurate. But the most damaging part of his statement was where he used the term ""legitimate rape."" The context he used it in was clearly for the term ""legitimate"" to mean ""actual"" or ""real."" In other words, if a woman was *really* raped, her body would reject the perp's sperm. 

At the time (this was 2012), he was denounced as a woman-hating rape-denier, because feminists demand that everyone believe every woman who has ever claimed she was raped, always (unless she claims she was raped by Bill Clinton, of course). So Akin was hit with a triple-whammy: He had an unpopular position on abortion, he apparently had no idea how the human reproductive system actually works, and he appeared to believe that a lot of women lie about being raped (which is probably true, but it's certainly not a politically correct opinion to have).

As a result of his gaffe, he was immediately denounced by every prominent Republican on the planet (except Mike Huckabee), he became an international laughingstock, he made a groveling apology video that did him no good, and he got his ass kicked in the election by 16 points against an unpopular incumbent.

Flash forward to today, and apparently his ""legitimate rape"" gaffe has morphed into something else entirely - that he actually believes it can be legitimate to rape a woman! Oh, and that this is a belief that is mainstream in the Republican Party.

But don't hold your breath waiting for the biased media to challenge Ms. Wasserman Schultz about this disgusting distortion and smear. This is just how the Democrats play the game, and the refs (the media) are happy to let them get away with it, no foul called. ",2016-03-16 05:41:25+00:00,d11nydp,1.0,t3_4ame25,1423.0,Conservative

1879,"Quick thoughts:

Trump: If The Donald gets the nomination, he quite simply *must* be able to provide more specifics when asked direct questions in front of a national audience. He can't debate Hillary one-on-one for 90 minutes and just talk about ""great deals"" over and over again. He could bullshit and insult his way through the debates when there were like seven other people on the stage eating up clock, but that's just not going to cut it any longer. Also, he really surprised me by basically pledging to send tens of thousands of troops to the Middle East to take out ISIS. I suspect he'll be walking that one back a bit tomorrow...I mean, a good part of his appeal is that he supposedly doesn't want any more land wars in Asia. But he was solid on his comments about Islam hating the West. CNN kept trying to get him to back down from that (even after the debate!), but he refused. Good for him. 

Rubio: Does anyone really question that Marco would be the front-runner if it wasn't for his leading role in the Gang Of Eight? If he hadn't committed that enormous self-inflicted wound, I think he'd be running away with the nomination. But conservatives just can't trust him because of that betrayal, so he's toast. Good debate performance, though. He knows his stuff. Of course, he had something of a home-court advantage in Miami, but still. 

Cruz: Good line near the end about Trump being a rich man's son, while all the other guys on stage grew up in working class families. He did alright tonight, but I think he's had stronger debates. He delivered no knock-out blows to Trump. 

Kasich: Wants to go to war in the Middle East, provoke Russia, and antagonize China. Other than that, sounds like a moderate Democrat on a lot of things. Meh.

Missouri (81% white) is an open primary. It's a quasi-Southern state, which ought to give Hillary the edge. But Bernie has decent a chance here.

1956,"My thoughts:

Ted Cruz - Serious. Offered substantive criticisms of Trump that would lead a reasonable conservative voter to question his candidacy. Tough, but not dirty. I think he won tonight.

Marco Rubio - Bitter, desperate, shrill, hoarse, sweaty, offered personal smears. A few decent answers (probably memorized). Not a great night for ""little Marco."" 

Donald Trump - Took fire from all sides (well, except from Kasich). Actually had a good reply when called on his flip-flops. Blew it when he admitted that he has officially ""changed"" on H-1B visas (gave a big opening to Cruz on this issue, and immigration policy more generally). The people he mentioned as his potential national security advisers are CFR establishment types, so his foreign policy may actually be just more of the same. Not a good night for him, but not a disaster either.

John Kasich - Sharper than he's been in the previous debates. Clearly trying to appeal to moderates, independents, and Democrats. Running on experience in government (he has much more than any of the other candidates) and also as a state-level Governor (as opposed to a federal-level Senator). He may begin to steal some of Rubio's support and actually become a credible candidate and the preferred establishment alternative (especially if he wins Ohio and Rubio loses Florida on March 15th).

Duke hasn't been a member of the KKK in 36 years. He specifically stated that he wasn't endorsing Trump and that he doesn't completely agree with Trump's positions. Duke isn't even a ""white supremacist,"" if you want to be precise about it. He's a self-described ""white nationalist.""

It's unfortunate that so many people are willing to believe and repeat the media's lies when they think it will benefit their preferred candidate.

The Left has been using this guy as a boogeyman to demonize the GOP for decades. They even tied George H. W. Bush to him - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duke#1992_Republican_Party_presidential_candidate

Trump's still gonna be the GOP nominee. And all the Rubio and Cruz supporters who spent March sliming him as some sort of a KKK monster are going to regret it if that helps elect Hillary president.

Trump's spokesperson (who is, you know, a black woman) was not ""defending"" David Duke. She was simply pointing out that David Duke doesn't speak for the Klan since he's not even a member of the group and hasn't been for decades. Therefore, it's not accurate to suggest (as the media most certainly has) that what David Duke says in 2016 has anything to do with the KKK.

She was correcting the record and attempting to untangle a media lie. She was not correcting the record on David Duke's behalf, but on Trump's behalf.

And this has nothing to do with Hitler or Nazis, Mr. Godwin.

As for the excuse about the earpiece? Most likely bullshit. But as our conversation here has demonstrated, it's a helluva lot easier to dismiss this as ""I didn't hear the question, sorry 'bout that"" rather than actually explaining what I presume was the real reasoning (he was sick and tired of being prompted to repudiate different people and groups over and over again in interviews by media hacks with agendas, so he said fuck it, I'm not giving these bastards what they want this time).

And there is a pretty clear double standard here. Has any establishment media person who has interviewed Obama ever prompted him to disavow the endorsements/support he's received from the New Black Panther Party, or Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, or the Communist Party USA?

The media is purposely conflating David Duke with the KKK. (Curiously, they didn't do that with powerful Democrat Senator Robert Byrd, who was also a former KKK leader.) 

It's like this:

Fact 1 - David Duke said something generally positive about Trump, but it *explicitly was not* an endorsement

Fact 2 - David Duke hasn't been a member of the KKK in over 30 years

Fact 3 - Trump has already repeatedly repudiated David Duke's support

So, the establishment media takes these three facts, and asks the following question:

""Mr. Trump, will you renounce the endorsement you received from KKK leader David Duke?""

I mean, it's a joke. ",2016-03-01 05:26:22+00:00,d0j1r2g,4.0,t1_d0j1gw3,594.0,Conservative

&gt; Donald Trump says that he does not want the endorsement of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and that he would ""certainly"" repudiate his support.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I don't need his endorsement, I certainly wouldn't want his endorsement, I don't need anybody's endorsement,"" Trump said in an interview on Bloomberg News.
&gt; 
&gt; Asked if he would repudiate an endorsement from Duke, he replied: ""Sure.""

This is a non-story. Trump had denounced Duke over and over again, but the media kept asking him about it over and over again. So Trump - who understandably hates the establishment media - decided not to be Jake Tapper's monkey on Sunday, and declined to play Disavowal Kabuki. 

Now the desperate GOPe is latching onto this non-scandal in a last-ditch effort to Stump Trump and thereby hand the presidential nomination over to establishment candidate Marco ""Foam"" Rubio, so they can get their beloved Amnesty and War next year. 

And, yeah, it's relevant that this supposed leader of the KKK has had literally nothing to do with the KKK since the Carter administration.

2037,"It's like this. There are primaries or caucuses in every state, plus DC, plus territories, etc. 

Every state has a number of ""pledged"" delegates based on the state's population. So, say Vermont has a lot fewer pledged delegates than California.

These pledged delegates are awarded based on the primary or caucus votes. So, if Bernie wins 60% of the vote in a state, he'll be awarded roughly 60% of the state's pledged delegates.

However, the Democrats have hundreds of ""superdelegates"" as well. These superdelegates are elected officials and other party bigwigs. They are not pledged to any candidate, and can vote for whoever they want at the national convention.

The purpose of the superdelegates is in case the Democrat voters give a majority of their support to a candidate that is deemed to be too extreme to be elected in the general election. So say Sanders won a slim majority of the pledged delegates, with Hillary close behind. If superdelegates didn't exist, that means Bernie would be the nominee. But with the superdelegates, it's possible that most of them would throw their support behind Hillary and give her enough votes to narrowly secure the nomination at the convention. 

(The Republicans don't have superdelegates, but a lot of their primaries have a winner-take-all format, meaning that it's entirely possible for a candidate with just 30% of the votes in a state to win 100% of that state's delegates in a four-way race, for example.)

I'll try to explain it, though I suspect I'm wasting my time...

""Piss Christ"" was clearly intended to desecrate a crucifix in order to offend Christians. 

Placing bacon in or near a mosque is clearly intended to desecrate the mosque and to offend Muslims. 

The ""artist"" who created ""Piss Christ"" was funded by a federal grant (using taxpayer dollars) and then his ""art"" was given awards. (When cultural conservatives reacted with outrage and demanded that the NEA be defunded or reformed, they were denounced by the establishment media and liberal Democrats as intolerant cretins who simply couldn't comprehend ""art."")

The person who placed bacon near the door of a mosque has been charged with a ""hate crime,"" is being held without bond, and is facing possible life in prison.

If you cannot see a double standard there, then I can't help you.

Now, obviously there is the additional factor of his breaking into a mosque and slashing shit up with a machete. If he was being charged with B&amp;E and vandalism, and was facing a few months in jail plus probation plus community service plus paying some restitution, that would be perfectly reasonable. If you B&amp;E into *any* building and vandalize it, then you should face that level of punishment. 

But because it was a mosque, and because he's not a Muslim, and because he used (gasp!) *bacon* as part of his vandalism, he has been labeled a ""hate criminal"" and is now facing the possibility of spending the rest of his natural life in a cell with rapists and murderers. 

That's not justice. And everyone here knows that if some clown named Malik Abdul Mohammed or something had broken into a church, broke a few windows, and flushed a Bible in the toilet, that he would not be facing a penalty anywhere near this severe.

2105,"&gt; Thus making the labor market more Competitive -- it's laisez [sic] faire economics.

Hey, maybe if we allow the entire population of the Third World in, our economy will become so ""competitive"" that Americans without advanced degrees can wait in lines outside The Home Depot to fight Bangladeshis and Cameroonians for the privilege to work for fifty cents an hour!

Also, it ain't laissez faire economics if the increasing number of people who are unable to find jobs because of the distended labor market are all forced to go on welfare. 

&gt; Sources please.

Um, common sense? Logic? Where else do you suppose people who *do not work* get the money they need to survive? Are they issued magic pinatas that are filled with cash from the Layabout Fairy?

&gt; they improve economic growth by making the labor market more competitive.

GDP may grow because companies are making more profit because they are spending less on labor costs. But that ignores the impact that is felt by the millions of Americans near the bottom of the economic ladder who have fewer and fewer job opportunities available to them, and whose wages remain stagnant even if they are fortunate enough to find employment.

2109,"The WSJ is pro-open borders and pro-amnesty, so I'm not surprised they had an article attempting to spin how illegal immigration can be beneficial.

Illegal immigrants tend to be unskilled. There are two things unskilled immigrants can do - work menial jobs, or not work at all. 

If they work menial jobs, that's taking away a job that would have otherwise gone to an unskilled American worker. (Plus the added competition that occurs when there is a larger labor pool for these jobs reduces wages, which harms everyone who works these types of jobs.) 

If they *don't* work, then they are either subsisting off welfare (which strains our social services and gouges the American taxpayer), or they are engaged in some criminal activity in order to make money (drug dealing, theft, etc.). In either case, they are a burden to the country. The only people who benefit are the businesses who hire these illegal unskilled workers who save on labor costs by doing so.

Also, the Mexican government actively encourages illegal immigration into the United States ( http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/world/americas/a-mexican-manual-for-illegal-migrants-upsets-some-in-us.html?_r=2 ), and they vigorously denounce any effort by our government to stop the flow. Why? Because they know that they are essentially exporting their unemployed, poor, and criminal into our country and making it *our* problem. They win, we lose. Trump wants to flip that around. 

Trump has provided a fairly detailed plan for how to do this, and you respond by saying he has no idea how to do it and offers no logistics at all. You denounce Trump for his immigration policy, then say you support Ted Cruz, who arguably has an even harsher immigration policy. I think you may be ... a little confused.

And with that much momentum, and that size of a delegate lead, it will be too late to stop Trump. He's certain to be the nominee after next Tuesday if Cruz stays in the race.

But, if Cruz drops out sometime between now and Monday, and gives a full-throated endorsement of Rubio, and Rubio responds by strongly implying that Cruz will be either his running mate, his Attorney General, or his first Supreme Court nominee, then there remains a chance that Rubio could make this primary process a real fight.

That's it. Kasich could maybe win Ohio in mid-March, but that's the only state where he's at all competitive. Carson has no chance of winning anywhere. And Rubio probably won't even win Florida unless Cruz is out of the race by then.

2133,"No black American under the age of 50 has experienced segregation. Every black American under the age of 40 has benefited (or at least is eligible to benefit) from Affirmative Action policies in college admissions, hiring, promoting, and the awarding of government contracts. Literally trillions of dollars in wealth have flowed from primarily white taxpayers to disproportionately black welfare recipients over the last half century. There are untold numbers of scholarships available just for black students. There are untold numbers of programs by nonprofit organizations that are designed specifically to benefit ""underprivileged urban youth"" (i.e., black kids). 

That's a helluva lot of black privilege. 

There is no legitimate excuse for a young, healthy black person in the United States of America to live a life of poverty in adulthood. If they choose to drop out of school, that's on them. If they choose to get knocked up and wind up a single mom, that's on them. If they choose to commit crimes and end up getting arrested, that's on them. If they choose to just sit around and do drugs all day, that's on them. (And the same can be said for white/Asian/Hispanic people as well.) It's free will. There is no nationwide conspiracy of faceless but all-powerful and malicious white people looking for random black people to hold back and oppress. That's the 'institutional racism' myth. 

A 20-something black American with a college degree in a useful field and no criminal record can pretty much walk into an entry-level job at any corporation or government agency. They are then put on the fast-track for promotions. Affirmative Action in action. Black people from Africa and Haiti aren't coming to this country by the thousands and thousands so that they can be oppressed by evil white people. 

And if 'white privilege' was really a thing, why is it that Asian Americans outperform white Americans in educational attainment and income? Are they benefiting from 'Asian privilege?' Or are they, on average, simply more studious than white Americans, and as a result they tend to get better jobs that pay more?

People throughout history, regardless of where they lived, have built these barriers *because they work*. So unless Guatemalans have developed the ability to jump thirty feet in the air, or Hondurans have invented teleportation technology, a wall on the U.S. border would work as well.

With gun control, however, it's rather different, because it's not the actual guns that are committing crimes...it's *people* who commit crimes. And people in different countries/cultures behave differently, because diversity. Compare, say, the Dominican Republic with Haiti.

As it pertains to gun control, comparing two completely different countries, on different continents, with entirely different cultures, histories, legal systems, and demographics, is pretty clearly an apples-to-oranges comparison, and therefore not especially valid. 

A much more valid comparison would be to compare a city/county/state/country before gun control with that same city/county/state/country after gun control. This has in fact been done - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Guns,_Less_Crime - and the data demonstrates that gun control actually has a counter-intuitive impact.

2202,"Let's look at the evidence. Benedict was the first pope to resign in nearly 600 years. He is an arch-traditionalist, so he would not be likely to shatter such a centuries-old tradition voluntarily. 

His stated reason for resigning was due to poor health...yet no specific health condition was mentioned. Three years later, he's still alive. 

He was known for being a very conservative pope. The media hates conservatives. His replacement, Francis, is a very left-wing pope. The media loves leftists. 

Some links - 

""The pontiff [Francis] has shortlisted Hollywood heavy-hitters for a special meeting at the Vatican this fall. The topic? Improving the church's portrayal in Western entertainment."" http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pope-francis-invites-oprah-ari-813032

""Pope Francis is set to make his Hollywood debut in a new film."" http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2016/02/02/pope-francis-already-rock-star-will-make-his-hollywood-debut/

TIME Magazine names Pope Francis Person Of The Year, calling him ""The People's Pope"" and hinting that he's going to bring radical change to the church - http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/person-of-the-year-pope-francis-the-peoples-pope/

During Benedict's tenure, most of the media's reporting regarding the Vatican centered on children being raped by priests. Now that the leftist Francis is pope, the media has suddenly stopped talking about child molestation scandals all that much, and instead spends their time praising Francis for ""modernizing"" the church.

So, yes, based on the available evidence, I am of the opinion that powerful forces within the Vatican forced Benedict to ""resign"" and had him replaced with a media-friendly pope in order to get better press for the church. 

This makes much more sense to me than the ""official story"" in which a pope with enormous respect for the traditions of the church just wakes up one day and says ""Wow, I'm old, LOL!"" and quits the job he'd worked his whole life for, and the church just coincidentally picks a homosexual-friendly leftist from outside of Europe who spews Marxist talking points during interviews with an enamored press.

Fewer than 2,000 people died. Many of the city's police officers abandoned their duties and fled. Looting started almost immediately. Shelters became fetid cesspools very quickly. People shot at rescue helicopters. There were numerous reports of rapes and murders.

Straw man - ""A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument which was not advanced by that opponent."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

Since I never advocated for legislating that black fathers stick around, you were guilty of the straw man fallacy. QED.

&gt; The school to prison pipeline discussion is about policies

It can be about policies. It can be about causes. It can be about a lot of things. You don't get to set the terms of discussion, however much you may want to do so.

&gt; Things that can be legislated.

Pro-Tip: Not all ""policies"" are a result of legislation. 

&gt; Having black fathers stick around can't be legislated

Well, it *could*, although it would be pretty difficult to enforce...

But there are certainly policies that could be implemented that would have an impact on black illegitimacy rates. For instance, one could propose a policy in which fathers who are married at the time of their child's birth **and** who reside in the same household as the mother and child until the child is at least five years of age are eligible for a one-time $50,000 tax credit. That would probably have an impact, don't you think? Or don't you believe that financial rewards are capable of incentivizing behavior? (Note: Before you go apeshit on another straw man, I'm not necessarily advocating for this policy, just demonstrating that it's possible for a policy to make an impact.)

As for the article I linked, it's an example of how progressives in one school district have attempted to address the 'school to prison pipeline,' so it's most certainly relevant to a discussion about...a progressive politician talking about addressing the 'school to prison pipeline.' Would Hillary's proposed policy be *exactly* the same as the policy in Minneapolis? Probably not. But the goal and reasoning are the same - ending zero-tolerance policies for the express purpose of being more lenient on nonwhite (primarily black) students. 

Quotes from the article:

&gt; Moving forward, every suspension of a black or brown student will be reviewed by the superintendent’s leadership team. The school district aims to more deeply understand the circumstances of suspensions with the goal of providing greater supports to the school, student or family in need. This team could choose to bring in additional resources for the student, family and school. [Why do only black and brown students get to benefit from this extra level of review? White privilege, I guess.]
&gt; 
&gt; We take ownership of ensuring that our policies and practices equitably serve all students, especially those who have been historically marginalized in MPS,” said Johnson. [Translation: We will serve all students equally, but we will serve our black and brown students *especially* equally. Because Orwell.]
&gt; 
&gt; MPS has undertaken many significant efforts in recent years to ensure that students, especially those of color, graduate from MPS with a high quality education. [Translation: We want our students to graduate with a high quality education, but we really, **really** want our black and brown students to graduate with a high quality education. Because equal treatment.]

&gt; Superintendent Bernadeia Johnson told NPR, “I and all of my staff will start to review all non-violent suspensions of students of color, especially black boys, to understand why they’re being suspended so we can help intervene with teachers, student leaders and help give them the targeted support they need for these students.” [Targeted support especially for black boys...so post-racial!]",2016-02-17 00:07:46+00:00,d02kg6x,8.0,t1_d02inn9,2878.0,AdamCarolla

2250,"The whole thing is bullshit. 

Most public schools have zero-tolerance policies. This means that students - any students - who violate those policies are punished, period. (Keep in mind, one of the main reasons that zero-tolerance policies were implemented in the first place was to take teacher and administrator discretion out of the equation *in order to ensure that discrimination did not occur*.)

It just so happens - to the surprise of no one who has ever attended a ""diverse"" school - that black students tend to violate those policies more frequently than do white or Asian students, and as such black students are more apt to get into trouble at school.

So Hillary and her progressive allies are saying that treating people equally and in an entirely color-blind manner is ""discrimination"" because black students happen to violate the rules more often than other students, and as a result black students are punished with greater frequency than other students.

So her plan is to spend two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000.00) of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students *regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules*.

Put another way, let's say there is a school with 1,000 students, 500 of whom are white and 500 who are black. If 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester, and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame, then under existing zero-tolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished. To a sane (i.e., non-leftist) person, this makes sense and seems perfectly fair. However, Hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination, since only 4% of the white students were punished over the semester while 20% of the black students were punished. So Hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school. This can be achieved either by a) punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished, or b) declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished. (Which one do you think is more likely to happen?)

So her plan is to spend two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000.00) of taxpayer money to have the federal government come in to local public schools and revamp their policies to ensure that black students are punished with roughly the same frequency as white students *regardless of the frequency with which the two groups commit violations of the school rules*.

Put another way, let's say there is a school with 1,000 students, 500 of whom are white and 500 who are black. If 20 of the white kids get into fights in a semester, and 100 of the black kids got into fights over the same time frame, then under existing zero-tolerance policies 20 white students would get punished and 100 black students would get punished. To a sane (i.e., non-liberal) person, this makes sense and seems fair. However, Hillary believes this is a sign of troubling racial discrimination, since only 4% of the white students were punished over the semester while 20% of the black students were punished. So Hillary would make sure that an equal number of white and black students were punished at this school. This can be achieved either by a) punishing 80 innocent white students so that 100 students of both races are punished, or b) declining to punish 80 of the guilty black students so that 20 students of both races are punished. (Which one do you think is more likely to happen?)

This is the Democrat Party in 2016, folks. Pandering so hard for the black vote that they will create completely different rules and standards for different races of people. ",2016-02-16 21:28:14+00:00,d02dwhd,1.0,t3_464lrk,1185.0,Conservative

Pro-Tip: Slavery ended in the United States over 150 years ago. And it ended because of a war in which about 600,000 white people died. Complaining about something from that long ago is actually pretty pathetic. The Irish were starved in the potato famine less than 200 years ago, yet they seem to have recovered as a people quite nicely since then. Japanese Americans were rounded up and put into camps less than 70 years ago, but they seem to have recovered as a group quite nicely since then. Every group on the planet has been oppressed/enslaved/mass-murdered at some point in their history, yet they all seem to eventually move beyond it. But not American blacks, for some reason. Odd.

Racism will never be ""eradicated,"" since it's a fundamental part of human nature to prefer people who are more similar to oneself than those who are different. So, yep, we'll get another 1,000 years of excuses...thanks for confirming!

First of all, blacks enslaving blacks/Arabs enslaving blacks/Arabs enslaving whites/etc. are not things that occurred only during ""ancient times [sic]."" Second, what would it matter if they *had* occurred in ""ancient times"" if your argument is that black people are allowed over a millennium of free excuses for bad things that happened in the past? You just contradicted yourself. 

Yes, there was segregation in the last century. So what? Japanese people were put in fucking camps in the last century. They seem to be doing fine. And every black American under the age of 50 has lived their entire lives in a post-segregated America. Affirmative Action (which is a government policy of racial discrimination against whites and in favor of blacks in college admissions, hiring, promotion, and the awarding of government contracts) has been in effect since the Nixon administration. So the ""institutional racism"" that exists is actually against white people. 

&gt; subgugating 

LOL. The Arab slave trade lasted from the 7th century into the 20th century. You're an ignoramus. 

Also, race is not the same as skin color. Skin color is just one characteristic that can be used to differentiate between people of different races, but it is hardly the only difference. 

And it should be pointed out, an ""entire race"" was not enslaved. At the time of the Civil War, there were fewer than four million black slaves in the American South. There were also hundreds of thousands of free blacks in the North. Meanwhile, there were many, many more millions of free blacks in Africa (some of whom were, ironically, enslaving other blacks). Slavery has been a part of every human civilization since the earliest times. In the United States, it ended after a Civil War was fought in which approximately 600,000 white people died. Whatever debt white people owed to black people because of slavery was paid in full 150+ years ago with the blood of hundreds of thousands of white men. 

Ah, so I see you're now you're making excuses for black people enslaving other black people. Hilarious! It sure seems like the only form of slavery that actually bothers you is the white-on-black kind. All the other types you seem eager to dismiss and not really important or relevant...strange.

There is no real evidence that the CIA brought crack into black communities in the U.S. It's just *yet another* way to excuse the failings of black people while blaming whitey. It never ends.

https://refugeeresettlementwatch.wordpress.com/refugee-resettlement-fact-sheets/

&gt; Refugee resettlement is profitable to the organizations involved in it. They receive money from the federal government for each refugee they bring over. They have almost no real responsibilities for these refugees. After 4 months the “sponsoring” organization is not even required to know where the refugee lives.
&gt; 
&gt; There are 9 main major refugee resettlement organizations (Volags from “Voluntary Agency”) with approximately 450 affiliated organizations throughout the country; many are run by former refugees.   Below are the 9 Volags that operate today:
&gt; 
* &gt; US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB),
* &gt; Lutheran Immigrant Aid Society (LIRS),
* &gt; International Rescue Committee (IRC),
* &gt; World Relief Corporation,
* &gt; Immigrant and Refugee Services of America (IRSA),
* &gt; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS),
* &gt; Church World Service (CWS),
* &gt; Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Episcopal Church of the USA,
* &gt; Ethiopian Community Development Center (ECDC),
&gt; 
&gt; Below are some of the sources of income for Volags:
&gt; 
&gt; a.  $1,850 per refugee (including children) from the State Department.
&gt; 
&gt; b.  Up to $2,200 for each refugee by participating in a U.S. DHHS program known as Matching Grant. To get the $2,200, the Volag need only show it spent $200 and gave away $800 worth of donated clothes, furniture or cars.
&gt; 
&gt; c. The Volag pockets 25% of every transportation loan it collects from refugees it “sponsors”.
&gt; 
&gt; d. All Volag expenses and overhead in the Washington, DC HQ are paid by the U.S. government.
&gt; 
&gt; e. For their refugee programs, Volags collect money from all federal grant programs – “Marriage Initiative”, “Faith-based”, “Ownership Society”, etc., as well as from various state and local grants.
&gt; 
&gt; The program is so lucrative that in some towns the Catholic Church has lessened support for traditional charity works to put more effort into resettlement. It uses collection offerings to promote the refugee resettlement program.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite their rhetoric, refugee agencies have steadfastly refused to use their own resources to maintain the U.S. refugee resettlement program. Public money has thoroughly driven out private money.

2386,"My thoughts:

Cruz - Really took a beating in the first ten minutes or so, then did pretty well. The thrashing he took early on will be overlooked somewhat by what followed closely afterwards...

Rubio - Pretty much got exposed as a smooth talking-points-parroting empty suit by Chris Christie. The exchange was kind of embarrassing for him, and he was clearly rattled a bit. I think he also hurt himself somewhat with his abortion answer. Keep in mind, New Hampshire is a pretty moderate state, and Rubio needs a strong showing there on Tuesday. Taking Todd Akin's position on rape-abortions and saying ""I'd rather lose an election than be wrong on life"" could hurt him in an area that had been his biggest strength - electability. 

Trump - Pretty typical Trump performance. He throat-punched Cruz early by pointing out that Cruz was afraid to attack him to his face, then got in a cheap shot on Cruz in his closing statement. Other than that, the main exchange of note was with Jeb over eminent domain (which most voters either don't understand or don't much care about). But it wasn't the actual exchange with Jeb that will be remembered - it was the way he denounced the booing audience right to their faces, implying that they are all a bunch of corrupt, connected establishment donors. It didn't play well (at all) in the debate hall, but you can bet that it played well with independent voters watching at home. New Hampshire holds the type of election where independents can vote in the GOP primary. Trump could get a bump.

Christie - Aggressive, strong, and solid. I'd say he was the winner tonight. His abortion answer was unsettling to some in the pro-life community, but that shouldn't hurt him much in socially moderate New Hampshire. He desperately needs at least a third place showing in the primary on Tuesday to remain a credible candidate. He may have talked his way into bronze - or even silver - in the Granite State tonight.

Kasich - He is overtly running as a bipartisan moderate. That didn't work in Iowa, and it almost certainly won't work in South Carolina. But it might work in New Hampshire. And he needs it to work in NH, because unless he gets at least third place, he's going to drop out. (Book it.) He'll still be on the VP radar for the remaining candidates, though, so he won't completely go away. Expect him to refrain from endorsing anyone for a while. He wants to watch this play out for a bit.

Jeb - He's not really fixable as a candidate. He's got a surname with enormous establishment baggage in a decidedly anti-establishment year. His body language sucks. He stammers when answering questions. Donald Trump makes it a point to humiliate him every chance he gets. That being said, it wasn't a particularly bad performance from Jeb tonight. He will probably finish 4th or 5th in New Hampshire, and then limp on to South Carolina, where he will get his entire family to stump for him in a last desperate battle for the nomination. So that should be entertaining.

Carson - From his bizarre delayed entrance, to his constant bitching whenever he got asked a question, it's pretty obvious that he knows he needs a miracle to win this thing, and that he's going to be dropping out soon. It will be interesting to see who he endorses. I doubt it will be Cruz. Probably either Rubio or Trump. He's sort of a wild card. He didn't do all that well in the debate tonight (other than a couple mildly humorous lines), and he won't do well in the primary on Tuesday. Why, exactly, is he running for president again?

Marco Rubio was born in Florida, grew up for a time in Nevada, but graduated from high school in Miami. He attended university for one year in Missouri, but finished up his schooling in Florida. He's lived in Florida ever since. He is currently a Senator from Florida.

So if nominating a Southerner for the first time in GOP history is something that matters to you (probably not), then Marco Rubio almost certainly fits the bill, and Ted Cruz probably does as well.

Says the very young person who has never been married, has no kids, has never had to pay a mortgage, and in fact has very little real-life experience outside of a classroom setting or a part-time job, but who feels he is wise beyond his years because he agrees with a left-wing career politician who promises him a bunch of free stuff.

You realize that this is the exact same phenomenon that gripped your age group exactly eight years ago, only for a different left-wing Senator, right? And twelve years ago (for Howard Dean). And sixteen years ago (for Ralph Nader). 

Same shit, different election year. Someone runs for president, promises to end all corruption and spread the wealth around, and gets the support of hundreds of thousands of naive college students. Trust me - Whether your hero wins or loses, you're gonna end up disappointed.

You know the biggest difference between a 20 year old and a 50 year old? (I mean, other than the fact that the 20 year old probably has more energy and a more interesting sex life.) A 50 year old has been 20 once before. But a 20 year old has never been 50. There is 30 years (give or take) of life experience that a college kid is missing relative to his/her parents. Three decades of life experience teaches a person a lot...believe it or not, even more than a couple years at a university as an undergrad.

2508,"Total federal spending in FY 2014 was about 3.5 trillion dollars:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png

About 850 billion dollars went to Social Security

About 825 billion dollars went to Medicare/Medicaid

About 600 billion dollars went to the military

850 + 825 + 600 = 2.275 trillion dollars

2.275/3.5 = 0.65; in other words, 65% of all federal spending is for the above three categories. That's nearly 2 out of every 3 dollars the federal government spends.

Interest on the existing debt (which we pretty much have to pay) is another roughly 225 billion dollars. 

225 + 2275 = 2500; in other words, 2.5 trillion dollars. 

So if we aren't going to cut entitlement spending, and we aren't going to cut military spending, the absolute bare minimum the federal government will spend every year is 2.5 trillion dollars. Of course, that figure will increase as the overall population continues to age and more money will need to be spent on Social Security and (especially) Medicare. 

Now, how much did the federal government collect in taxes and revenue in FY 2014? About 3 trillion:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png

So we've got a deficit of about 500 billion dollars. In order to balance the budget in the short-term without cutting any of the spending I've already mentioned and without raising taxes, we'd have to slash the remaining roughly one trillion dollars in federal spending by about 50%. That would be extraordinarily difficult to do, but let's say we somehow managed to do it anyway. The budget wouldn't remain balanced for very long, because of the rapidly increasing costs of Social Security and Medicare that I already mentioned. 

So, while I don't *want* to cut defense spending, I also don't want to live in a bankrupt nation. Most likely, what will happen in the not-too-distant future is this: a major overhaul of the country's health care system (single payer?) that will essentially ration care for old, sick people (passive euthanasia for the terminally ill) in order to reduce the amount spent on Medicare, coupled with sizable across-the-board tax increases and pretty deep cuts to defense spending. 

I don't really see the alternative, given the public's love of government handouts. Well, actually there is an alternative - an authoritarian regime takes power, suspending elections and ignoring the wishes of the masses in an effort to get the country's house in order. 

So we either become Europe, or we become some hybrid of Putin's Russia, Pinochet's Chile, Syngman Rhee's South Korea, Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan, and Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore.",2016-01-31 20:26:32+00:00,cziw9sf,4.0,t1_czitwn8,3983.0,Conservative

I suspect both parties are treating this issue sort of like a game of hot potato. The deficit/debt will inevitably cause the economy to implode at some point, and the party in power will be forced to implement severe austerity measures in order to recover from it. The hope that both sides have is that the *other* party will be in power when the inevitable occurs, and the public ends up blaming them for both the collapse *and* for the unpopular post-collapse policies that will have to be implemented.

So Megyn is the future for the Fox News brand, and Trump is damaging that brand. And he's damaging that brand because he is righteously pissed off at Fox News because they set him up with that horribly loaded question - asked by the only female moderator, no less - about how he is guilty of engaging in the ""war on women"" at the first debate. Trump handled the question quite well, but he hasn't forgotten that the *intent* of the bigwigs at Fox News was to use that question as a kill-shot to wreck his candidacy. Remember, that first debate was very early on in the process, back when almost everyone thought Trump's support would eventually collapse. Megyn and Fox News wanted to be the catalyst for that ""inevitable"" collapse.

Trump does not forgive. Trump does not forget. The way to hurt Fox News is to hurt Megyn Kelly. So Trump keeps hammering away at her and chipping away at her credibility, driving a wedge between her and the Fox News viewership. 

So now Trump has brilliantly prepared the battlefield, and is now in a position in which he can't lose. If Fox News drops Megyn, Trump wins. If Fox News doesn't drop Megyn, but she has been cowed into throwing only softballs at him, Trump wins. If Fox News doesn't drop Megyn and she throws more loaded questions at him, then Trump will simply call her on her obvious bias, and Trump still wins.

This will then put a lot of pressure on Obama on whether or not to allow his AG to indict Hillary. Indicting Hillary would end her political career, leaving avowed socialist Bernie Sanders as the clear front-runner for the Dem nomination. I suspect there would then be some astro-turfed ""Draft Biden"" movement, and our embarrassing VP would become the new establishment pick to beat back Bernie. 

Or, Obama could order his AG to decline to prosecute Hillary. This would damage Obama's already sketchy legacy, and though it would probably allow Hillary to win the nomination over Sanders, she may be sufficiently crippled by all this as to get absolutely landslided in November.

So, from a Republican standpoint, this is sort of a win-win. She's pretty clearly guilty of violating federal law, based solely on what we know already (and there may be even more shoes to drop). I can't imagine the FBI is willing to completely destroy their credibility simply to cover-up for Hillary. So I don't think the FBI will itself decline to pursue charges.

2680,"my thoughts on tonight's debate:

kasich: he's something of a head-scratcher. other than mentioning his family or his political experience, the main thing he talks about is how much of a compromising, bipartisan moderate he is. the only thing i can figure is that he knows he has no shot at the nomination, but he hopes to get enough positive buzz from the liberal media that the eventual nominee - assuming it's a right-wing type like trump or cruz, who may feel obligated to pick a moderate as his running-mate in order to get ideological ""balance"" on the ticket - will choose kasich because of the name-recognition he's gained plus the fact that he's the governor of ohio (a must-win state for the republicans). 

jeb: his body language is awful. he apparently inherited his stumbling speaking style from the other men in his family. the only thing that seems to animate him is rebutting trump, but then he fails miserably at that. he knows he's done. what a waste of tens of millions of lobbyist dollars.

carson: funny, but out of his depth. the life expectancy of his candidacy can now safely be measured in weeks.

christie: strong debater. serious about entitlement reform. can be funny. perhaps the (unintentionally?) funniest moment of the debate was when he was asked about bridges, though he kept a straight face. unfortunately, i've already vowed never to vote for the man after he threw romney under the bus in 2012. so fuck him.

marco: not his strongest debate performance, although he did deliver a devastating attack on cruz right near the end of the debate. he's still the establishment's golden boy. i guess his strategy is to damage cruz's credibility as a ""true conservative"" enough to move into second place, and then to take on trump directly as the more serious/experienced/electable candidate in what would then basically be a two-man race.

cruz: great responses about his ""birther"" situation...although the fact that this is even a topic of discussion in a national debate just weeks before voting begins is problematic for him. looked rattled a bit by marco's last-minute attack on his conservative credentials/flip-flopping/pandering. i thought he started the debate much stronger than he finished it.

trump: i think this was his sharpest performance yet. his comments about 9/11 made me cringe a bit, but they probably played pretty well with the GOP primary electorate (how else can a conservative say something positive about the people of nyc?). he suffered no knock-out blows, got to humiliate jeb again, and spoke with passion about the issue of trade. this is probably the first debate he's actually won (drudge online polls notwithstanding).

If the buildings have no heat or running water, why is that so? Who is responsible for budgeting for heat/water in DPS? Are school buildings simply left without heat and water, or is heat and water provided, but then the students and/or local community simply tear up the infrastructure at night and sell it as scrap?

The food budget should be coming from federal programs. Why is this budget not being spent on actual food for actual students? Are evil white people sneaking on to the campuses of various public schools in Detroit and stealing the lunch lady's food? Please explain.

If there are no books, who is in charge of providing the funding for textbooks for DPS, and why are these books not being provided to students? Or, are students simply stealing/losing/destroying their textbooks during the school year, and there isn't sufficient funding to replace them all?

I mean, there is certainly money being distributed to DPS. In fact, more money is being distributed to DPS per student than most other public school systems in the area -

2732,"""It's time. I'm ready,"" Lena Dunham whispered to me after we had been making out - heavily - for the better part of an hour.

*Fucking finally*, I thought to myself. Her mouth had tasted like a strange mixture of seafood paella and week-old quiche, seasoned with more than a pinch of shame. 

""Is that a yes? Are you ready to participate in consensual vaginal intercourse with me now?"" 

She put a finger to her lips. The bottom one had what appeared to be a mostly-but-not-quite-fully-healed chancre sore, I noticed with some alarm. 

""Don't spoil the mood, big man. Feed it to me. Put it inside my *lower* mouth."" She attempted to speak the last sentence in a purr, but it came out more gurgly that anything. 

""I don't want to spoil the mood, uh, *beautiful*, but I just need you to vocalize your consent before we go any further."" I shot her a pleading look.

""My cunt sure looks like it's consenting,"" she said, as she spread apart her sizable labia, which resembled the wings of a baby albino bat. Her Bartholin's ducts were clearly visible, and they appeared to be dilated to such an extreme degree that she could have easily smuggled a couple garbanzo beans in there. ""I feel like I've got Victoria Falls between my legs. The bed is already soaked down to the mattress. Give it to me!"" she barked.

I moved a step forward, then paused. ""I-I just want this to be safe...for both of us. This is an affirmative consent state, after all.""

""What more do I need to tell you?"" she asked, appearing to grow a touch annoyed. ""I am laying here in my bedroom, completely naked, spread eagle, with my four-inch clit fully engorged, begging you to pound me until my eyes bleed, and you're still unsure if I want this? Are you, like, a little bit stupid or something?""

""I-I know...it's just, I want to make sure that we are able to look back on this evening without any regrets. I want you to feel that I fully respected you, as a person, not just as a gaping, slimy fuckhole. I want you to know that I *believe* in rape culture, and I, as a proud male feminist, am doing whatever I can, in any way I can, to fight this evil of the patriarchy. Please, darling Lena, let us be completely open and honest about the intimate moment we are about to share. Please just tell me, '*Yes*.'""

""If I don't have a cock inside of me in the next five seconds, I'm getting dressed and going over to Judd's house.""

I seized the moment. I strode across the small distance separating us and plunged my rock-hard member deep into her quivering beef-den.  

Her mouth opened wide into a perfect O-shape. Her eyes bulged, and then rolled slowly back as her eyelids fluttered. I felt my purple-helmeted comrade pressing up against her knobby cervix. 

She began to moan. The sound was low, and it emanated from deep within her. The decibels of her moan increased with every thrust of my hips. The sound began to transform from just a noise to something more recognizable. I looked down at her face. It was a twisted rictus of hate. Startled, I immediately ceased my thrusting. 

But it was too late. 

The sound, louder still, clearer still. ""rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP*PPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEE***EEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**""

""What?"" I gasped. ""You're joking, right? You can't be serious!""

2739,"This type of violent black-on-white street crime has been going on in this country at epidemic levels for decades now. But of course the establishment media (and the Democrats, BIRM) focus almost exclusively on the theme of white-on-black violence instead. 

Examples include ""White Hispanic"" George Zimmerman defending himself from Trayvon Martin and Officer Darren Wilson defending himself from ""Gentle Giant"" Michael Brown. 

Based on dishonest portrayals of these incidents by the establishment media (http://newsbusters7.s3.amazonaws.com/images/CNN%20Newsroom-HandsUpDontShoot-Dec13-b.jpg), low-information urban blacks understandably react with rage and violence, and as a result we get riots in places like Ferguson and Baltimore. 

Then this misguided, ill-informed black rage metastasizes into groups like Black Lives Matter, which are comprised primarily of hateful black power extremists, but who the establishment media nonetheless refers to as ""civil rights activists.""

This is America in 2016. This was also America in 2015. And this was America in 2010. And in 2000. And 1990. And even well before that. 

This is the world we find ourselves living in, in which the real, factual reality bares little resemblance to the ""reality"" presented to the masses by the establishment media, day in and day out, on ubiquitous flickering screens from sea to shining sea.

When the late, great Andrew Breitbart said this - www.youtube.com/watch?v=YthG-MeKcbQ - he was talking about the same exact kind of bullshit that I'm talking about right now.

This is war, folks. When Clausewitz wrote that ""war is the continuation of politics by other means,"" that wasn't just a cute little phrase he made up for giggles. He meant it.

These motherfuckers are coming for us. And, if you're of a certain age, they're coming for your kids, too. And they are in a position to do that precisely because they control the levers of power and influence in this country - academia, the bureaucracy, the news and entertainment media, and the federal government. And if we sit idly by and continue to allow these filth to run right over us, they will keep on winning. And do not forget that in war, there can be only one winner.

Let 2016 be the year in which we start punching back. Let's bloody their fucking noses. If Trump is the nominee, volunteer. If Cruz is the nominee, volunteer. If Carson is the nominee, volunteer. Hell, even if Rubio is the nominee, volunteer. Let's landslide their asses, and then let's ""fundamentally transform"" our country...back.

2780,"&gt; You'll note that the tweet that's apparently at issue is not from a person who covers reproductive rights at all in any way.

Sarah Kliff official website - http://www.sarahkliff.com/bio

""Sarah Kliff is a senior editor at Vox.com, where she oversees **health, medicine** and education coverage. Sarah joined Vox Media in February 2014 from the Washington Post, where **she covered health policy** ...""

""Prior to the Washington Post, Sarah Kliff was a staff writer at Politico, also **covering health policy**.""

So, you're completely wrong. ""Reproductive rights"" certainly falls under ""health."" She has written extensively on the topic of abortion. Here's a quick taste:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/02/03/the-abortion-rate-is-at-a-30-year-low/

http://www.newsweek.com/watching-my-first-abortion-79069

She also once hilariously wrote that the Gosnell horror wasn't worth her time because it was just a ""local crime"" story - http://www.breitbart.com/blog/2013/04/11/post-reporter-gosnell-is-just-a-local-crime-story/

She's writes about abortion, she's pretty transparently pro-abortion, and she accepts gifts from the abortion industry. No ethical issue here, really? No wonder people in your profession are viewed by the general public as being lower than slugs. 

&gt; And that her tweet is in no way a boast.

No, she just used social media to show to the entire world the gift that she just got. 

Definition of ""boast"" from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boast - ""to be proud in the possession of""

&gt; And that the tweet doesn't imply or indicate in any way that she did anything other than receive a tiny chocolate.

The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) is one of the oldest organizations representing journalists in the United States. The national organization debuted in 1909. The SPJ states that journalists should ""**[r]efuse gifts**, favors, fees, free travel and special treatment, and avoid political and other outside activities that **may compromise integrity or impartiality, or may damage credibility**.""

http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp

&gt; And that the tweet provides no information about what she did with said chocolate, either eating it or passing it along to a colleague or throwing it out.

Doesn't matter. She received it. Damage done. 

&gt; Also, many abortions providers (Planned Parenthood included) are non-profits, making industry the incorrect term.

Here's an article in The New York Times that refers to the ""nonprofit industry"" - http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/education/how-to-profit-modestly-by-moving-to-a-nonprofit.html

My point is that I have addressed the ""points"" made by leftists a thousand times, but due to their epistemic closure, it does no good. Facts presented to them that they do not want to hear simply go in one ear and out the other. Citations are ignored. It is a frustrating waste of time and energy. Therefore, I have learned over the years that it is utterly pointless to engage with the die-hard leftist. Their minds are not open enough for a true debate - an exchange of ideas - to take place. I could tell from the first paragraph of your comment last night that you are one of these types, and therefore not worthy of my time. Unfortunately, you've managed to troll a few additional replies out of me this morning. Alas, it's Christmas Eve today and I have rather more important things to do than correspond with a Hillary supporter who honestly believes that conservatives hate their own planet. 

You may now reply and continue to suggest that I've never once in my entire life considered leftist arguments or attempted to debate them. ;) ",2015-12-24 17:12:07+00:00,cya5wht,10.0,t1_cya57j1,1289.0,MensRights

These are people (leftists) who all hold essentially the same opinions about everything. They are like the Borg. If you've debated one of them, you've debated all of them. There is never anything new.

And, having wasted my time over the years debating them, another key feature I've noted of the modern Marxist is a complete aversion to facts that do not fit the ideologically-approved narrative. Therefore, pointing out facts to them - even while citing sources - does not penetrate their indoctrination. The suffer from a severe case of epistemic closure. Hence, it's a complete waste of time engaging with them. 

If someone honestly, seriously, **sincerely** believes that the right *hates* science, and *hates* the planet, and *hates* the future...how exactly do you go about having a reasonable discussion with this person? They believe insane things, and their mind is clearly made up. Your best bet is simply to shrug and move on. Not everyone is salvageable.

Who is being refused abortions? Last I checked no adult woman has been refused an abortion in this country in the last 40+ years. Please stop lying.

No one ""denies"" that the climate is (and has always been, and always will be) changing. There are legitimate questions over how much it is changing, in what ways it is changing, how much of that is influenced by human behavior, how much of the impact is negative, how best to mitigate the impact, etc. It would be nice if you would stop lying.

Stem cell research? Are you joking? You might want to drop this particular shitlib talking point, seeing as it's from about 2004. Adult stem cells are the type that are yielding actual results, not the more controversial embryonic stem cells. But even with embryonic stem cells, the only argument was whether the federal taxpayer was going to be funding the research, not whether the research would be conducted. And even then, there was a debate about it on the right, not a monolithic opinion. Are you even capable of not lying?

This is why it's so frustrating and, ultimately, pointless to debate the mind-washed libtard. They excel at spewing dishonest talking points and attacking strawmen while posing as the morally and intellectually superior individual. Pathetic.

I mean, just from a purely MRA perspective, voting Democrat is working against your own interests, and that alone should be enough to get you to at least vote third party. But these retards are Ready For Hillary, so what can you do?

Rand Paul was solid, so naturally he'll remain stuck in the low single digits.

3081,"**Pretend Planned Parenthood performed 400 abortions in the last three months.**

I'd have to really suspend my disbelief for that. They perform more than twice that many abortions every single day (on average).

""Planned Parenthood continues to serve hundreds of women after losing funding"" - That would be wrong, since they didn't lose their federal funding.

""Hundreds of young women able to get help from Planned Parenthood when left with few other choices"" - Also untrue. Other choices are numerous, and include - adoption, shotgun marriage, single motherhood, having an abortion at a non-Planned Parenthood facility, not getting knocked up in the first place, etc.

""Drop in single mother households on welfare attributed to abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood."" - Uses the euphemism ""services"" to obscure the blunt truth: Planned Parenthood killed the babies of these women so they wouldn't have to become single mothers on welfare. 

""Planned Parenthood states that it has performed 400 emergency abortions for underprivileged women without access to medical care"" - That would be simply regurgitating the organization's (no doubt dishonest) press release.

""Over 300 babies killed in Planned Parenthood clinics as the number of abortions just keeps growing"" - Simply add the word ""unborn"" in front of ""babies"" and this is a perfectly factual statement. 

""Despite efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, at least 400 abortions have occurred in the last three months with no signs of stopping"" - Looks pretty solid.

""At over 100 abortions per month, is something sketchy going on at Planned Parenthood?"" - Ridiculous headline that asks a question instead of simply making a factual statement.

""Last year, Congress enacted budget cuts to limit Planned Parenthood's ability to provide controversial abortion services. Unfortunately, some doctors at Planned Parenthood are abusing what's left of the federal funds to continue performing abortions, terminating a minimum of 400 unborn fetuses in the last three months"" - Nope, because it ignores the fact that the defunding of Planned Parenthood was never implemented - https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress-to-launch-first-strike-targeting-planned-parenthood-funding/2015/08/03/1d904e50-39fc-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html

http://www.lifenews.com/2012/09/05/media-hides-fact-planned-parenthood-does-40-of-abortions/

If one views abortion from the perspective of someone who is pro-life (as tens of millions of Americans are), abortion is the equivalent of murder; as such, Planned Parenthood makes large amounts of money by engaging in mass infanticide. And this wholesale butchery of the innocent is ongoing.

So saying ""only 3% of their services account for abortion"" is like saying ""only 3% of Nazi resources were allocated to the death camps.""

3206,"If she had written ""the crowd booed for several seconds,"" alright, fine. But she pretends to have special knowledge of *what* the crowd was booing. Maybe they were booing Obama? Maybe they were booing Hillary, who supports Obama's policy. Maybe they were booing the policy itself? Maybe they were booing Islamists? Maybe they were booing terrorists? To claim that the crowd was booing ""refugees,"" is biased and dishonest. 

Also, most of the people that Europe has recently absorbed are *not* from Syria, and they are *not* actually ""refugees."" They are economic migrants looking for welfare.

So the addition of those two words - ""Syrian refugees"" - is unfair and biased against the Trump supporters in the audience. 

As for the first sentence I quoted in the headline, Trump did not ""launch right into"" anything. As the article itself points out, he called for a moment of silence first. *Then* he discussed the attacks, as of course he would, because the attacks are a major news story that anyone running for president naturally would be expected to talk about. 

By writing that he ""launched"" into the ""politics"" of the attacks, the writer is suggesting that Trump immediately began politicizing the deaths of people. But how exactly is someone running for political office expected to discuss an issue without discussing the *politics* of the issue? Should he have just talked about his feels instead?

3226,"My thoughts:

1 - Rubio wins on intangibles. He's telegenic, he's got a smooth delivery, and he's got a solid center-right message. Throw in the fact that he grew up working class, that he's relatively young, that he is not especially wealthy, and that he's Hispanic, and you've got seemingly the perfect Republican (establishment) candidate.

2 - Cruz is a strong debater. And that's not just my opinion: The man won awards for his debating skill when he was in college. When Kasich made the mistake of directly challenging him tonight, Cruz set him up perfectly for an embarrassing implosion. It's a shame that he was not allowed to answer a climate change question tonight (and I believe this is the second debate in a row in which he's tried to jump in on that topic and the moderators have denied him). 

3 - Rand was the historian and scholar in the room tonight. The one guy willing to say ""no"" to endless wars and an overly-aggressive foreign policy. This was, I think, his best debate performance yet. But he remains out of sync with a large portion of the GOP's base. It will be very hard for him to ever truly ""win"" a Republican Party debate given some of his libertarian views. 

4 - Carly is a good debater, but the tone of her voice and the ... unpleasant look on her face is sort of a turn-off. I stand by my belief that she's really running for Vice President. She would be a great attack dog as someone's running mate on the campaign trail against Hillary.

5 - Trump is Trump. He's still amusing, although the jokes are getting a bit old. On his signature issue, immigration, he seems to be all over the place, and it's been months since his campaign published an official position on the issue. He wants to deport them all...but then let them all back in? What would be the point of that? The Donald has jumped The Shark.

6 - Carson remains likable and apparently half-asleep. I enjoy his attacks on the media, but there really isn't much else there, other than his fascinating biography (which is under assault by...the media). White guilt is an incredibly powerful phenomenon, however, so it's still entirely possible he'll become our next president.

7 - Jeb was Jeb. Stammering at times, appearing somewhat nervous and weak, not making any particularly forceful points...yep, that's Jeb. With Rubio ascendant, he's finished. The GOP establishment has a new golden boy. 

8 - Kasich tried being aggressive in order to make sure he got equal time and in an effort to get noticed. But there were a few problems: he's clearly too moderate/liberal on a number of issues to realistically win the nomination; his speaking delivery isn't all that smooth or confidence-inspiring; and he basically committed suicide on stage when he tried to challenge Cruz on the issue of bank bailouts.

After a week, the hunger began. Let me explain: You do not know hunger. I have no doubt that you have been hungry from time to time in your life, but I sincerely doubt that you have felt the icy talon of true hunger.

When hunger hits, reason takes flight. I began to gnaw on the seat-belts from the ruined aircraft. There was no nutritional value to be found there, but the merest hope that something of substance other than snow would fill my belly was enough incentive to keep me gnawing. 

I was not alone in this. Several others fed on equally inedible debris in a desperate attempt to sate their maniac hunger. 

It gets worse. One of my teammates - I kid you not - ate his own thumb, while it remained attached to his hand. The bitter cold had numbed the pain sufficiently to allow him to feast on his own flesh: auto-cannibalism. 

I thank the Lord Jesus to this day that he did not survive much longer. One wonders what else he would have eaten. ",2015-10-17 03:46:55+00:00,cw2n5bo,4.0,t1_cw2mwa0,584.0,casualiama

3288,"My thoughts on the debate:

Chafee frankly embarrassed himself. Give me a six-pack of Coors Light and an hour to prepare, and I could have put in a more credible debate performance than the ironically-named ""Lincoln."" 

Webb is simply too reasonable and serious to have a chance at winning the Democrat nomination in 2016. Also, while he certainly had a valid point about not getting equal time, his constant bitching about it did him no favors. 

O'Malley reminds me of John Edwards. He's pretty clearly an insincere leftist slime-ball, but he does possess the same type of charisma that Edwards (and, for that matter, Hillary's husband) had. He'll go up a couple points in the polls after this debate, but not enough to really matter.

Sanders ... is Sanders. He's a socialist who wants to turn the U.S. into Sweden. He's a man of some principle and integrity, though, so there's that ... although he did throw in some #BlackLivesMatter pandering. He had a couple moments where he couldn't hear the question, and another instance in which he appeared to have a ""senior moment"" (and some light laughter was heard from the audience), but I don't think he really hurt himself any. 

And that leaves us with Hillary. *Sigh.* What can I say? She's good at remembering and regurgitating pre-packaged semi-responses to questions at debates. She's clearly a dishonest and unpleasant human being, but she *does* have two X chromosomes (as she is eager to remind viewers approximately every 4 minutes), and since the majority of voters are women, she'll probably be our next president.

Iglesias has been hitting really well. I have some faith in Alex Wilson and Blaine Hardy coming out of the bullpen.
