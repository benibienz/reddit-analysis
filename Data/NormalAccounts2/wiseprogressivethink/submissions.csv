The cancer is in three separate tumors all in the same lung. Other than her hair falling out, insomnia, and some diarrhea, she hasn't really experienced bad side effects.  

She has been receiving chemo (two chemicals one week, one chemical the following week, the next week off, and repeat) for about four months now. 

The most recent CAT scan showed that all three tumors have shrunk (shrank?) dramatically, to the point where one of them is almost completely gone. The cancer has not spread anywhere else.

So I was a bit surprised to learn that her doctor is thinking about stopping the current chemo regimen in another month or so, and replacing it with a different type of ""maintenance"" chemo where she would be given one chemical once every three weeks. 

I haven't spoken directly with her doctor yet, so I was hoping someone here could perhaps provide an explanation for this. It would seem to me, as a layperson, that if the current chemo regimen is working so well with relatively minor side effects, that they would continue it until the cancer was completely eradicated. But then, I'm not an oncologist, or any type of medical doctor, so I'm sure that I'm missing something.

Any insight is appreciated. Thanks in advance. ",cancer,Question about why doctor is thinking about stopping chemo even though it's working...,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/4vf557/question_about_why_doctor_is_thinking_about/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSV3R5hwMsM

Summary of the situation: Fat beta who rates himself 5/10 is dating hot ski bunny. She cucks him while allegedly ""blackout drunk"" with some random Chad. She doesn't tell him until a month later when he confronts her after he notices that urination has become agonizing and he is diagnosed with chlamydia. He makes excuses for her cheating by saying she ""slipped up"" and that ""she didn't have anyone there to watch out for her."" This beta bux cuck then lets her move in with him. 

I won't spoil the rest, but it's worth watching/listening to. During the conversation, Stefan discusses many topics that red-pillers are well aware of (female lack of agency, alpha male genes, etc.). Stefan also explodes on the guy a few times, which is sort of satisfying to witness.

Anyway, one ad in particular caught my eye, because it was rather unusual - http://i.imgur.com/xeGAlbR.png

I decided to email her, just for giggles. It was a short email, just providing some basic info about myself and asking her a few questions about herself. I didn't get a reply, which is quite common when replying to CL ads.

So a week or two go by and I completely forget about the ad. Then today, my inbox contains a message with this wall of text - http://i.imgur.com/GGiWKNj.png (part one) http://i.imgur.com/gDTw7EP.png (part two)

Yeah, she's kooky, for sure. But if you actually read through it all, there are definitely some lessons from TRP buried in there. 

For example, she fell hard for an Alpha when she was young and has been kept in line for years by Dread Game. She is now looking to Branch Swing to a Beta Bux White Knight who will rescue her now that she's well past The Wall. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share this mildly amusing example of a woman being a woman...if you can think of any particularly humorous replies, share them in the comments. (I'm not planning on replying otherwise, for obvious reasons.)

The truth is, I have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. In fact, probably more than you. 
&gt; 
&gt; I haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse I know. The temptation was just too much. I can no longer live with the guilt and I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. I promise that it won't happen again. Please come up with a fee for usage, and I'll pay you. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Alan. 

John, feeling insulted and betrayed, grabbed his gun, stomped next door and shot his neighbor dead. He returned home where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. He took out his phone where he saw he had a subsequent message from his neighbor. 

&gt; Hi John, 
&gt; 
&gt; This is Alan next door again. Sorry about the slight typo on my last text. I expect you worked it out anyway, but as I’m sure you noticed that my smart phone’s Autocorrect feature changed “Wi-Fi” to ""Wife”. Technology eh?? Hope you got a chuckle from that. 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Alan. ",Jokes,The neighbor's note,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4qjngj/the_neighbors_note/

The ad pretty strongly implied that I actually wanted to meet some women for NSA fucking, but it was worded in such a way as to provide plausible deniability. (And it was worded in such a way as to pique the interest of the female mind, such as it is, but that's another post.)

I got a fairly large volume of responses (some of which were from dudes; it never fucking fails). After some back-and-forth communicating, photo-exchanging, and the obligatory pruning, I winnowed the worthies down to two. 

One is a divorced woman in another county. Nice body, a bit older, stable, educated, able to support herself, but clearly wants a LTR. Friend-zoned (for now).

The other lives near me; is married with children; is at her sexual peak while her beta bux hubby works all day at an office job and then ignores her while playing internet games all night; and is basically happy with her life as-is, but just needs to get rough-fucked by a stranger to add some spice to her dull suburban stay-at-home-mom life. 

Obviously, I focused on the latter.

Email exchange leads to texting leads to sexting. I think by now I have a better understanding of this gal's lady parts than her gynecologist. 

I set up a meeting without her even realizing that I'm setting us up for a meeting. I drop hints about a window of availability and my location. Thanks to some subtle Pavlovian conditioning (or is it operant? I can never remember), she ""surprises"" me there. I make sure it's a good place for a first meet - a public place, but reasonably private; I'm wearing as few clothes as is acceptable outside of a beach setting; I'm sweating from exercise (a slight BO from exertion is actually a natural aphrodisiac to women); and I made sure to clean myself up beforehand (shaved, trimmed nose hair, plucked uni-brow, etc.). She thinks it's a chance, casual encounter; I've basically been prepping for this moment all day. 

I play it casual. Lots of smiling, joking, teasing. Light touching, but nothing that would trip her ASD. I make sure the brief meeting ends before the conversation lags.

Later than day, lots of texts praising me for being even ""hotter"" in person, looking forward to the next meeting, etc.

Here's the twist, and this is the part where The Red Pill really comes into play.

A couple days later, the texts are less flirty and less frequent. I sense something is up, but I keep that suspicion to myself. She mentions some other dude she had a chance encounter with. My natural blue-pill reaction is to be jealous and ask a bunch of questions about him. Instead, I basically ignore the existence of this other guy in my replies. 

She texts me later that night, hinting about how bad she feels about us talking, how guilty, she's a married woman, she has children, what is she doing? I agree and amplify - yeah, it is pretty reckless, we probably shouldn't talk anymore.

No reply.

I hold my ground. No communication for almost 24 hours. And then...

Long story short (ask me in the comments if you care, but the details don't really matter), she re-initiated contact with me, and within hours openly invited me over to her house for kinky (oh, *yes*) sex while her husband is at work and her kids are in school. 

**DREAD GAME.** Shit works.

My old blue-pill self would have never been able to work that. A blue-pill version of me would have been more likely to have had a restraining order thrown at him instead of hot married pussy.

Turns out the median length of sexual intercourse (from penis entering vagina to ejaculation) is a little over five minutes. So, I'm feeling a little bit better about myself...

But here's an even more interesting *evolutionary* (and therefore relevant to this sub) tidbit near the end of the article:

&gt; Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. 
&gt; 
&gt; In 2003, researchers showed – using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) – that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.
&gt; 
&gt; What this suggests is that men's repeated thrusting might function to displace other men's semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. 
&gt; 
&gt; Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well. 

Never thought of that before. But now that I am...it would seem to make sense that the longer the penis, the deeper inside it goes, and therefore the more likely it is to be able to reach into every nook and cranny and pull out some other dude's load before it can fertilize the slut's egg. So, natural selection thereby picked bigger dicks. ",TheRedPill,An article about an interesting study on how long the act of intercourse lasts for the average couple mentions a different study that's even more interesting,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4df2b4/an_article_about_an_interesting_study_on_how_long/

Wisconsin - 42 Delegates

Open Primary - Winner-Take-All

Analysis: The two most recent polls both show Cruz just slightly ahead of Trump. An Emerson poll had Cruz 36, Trump 35, and Kasich 19 (10 percent undecided). A rather less reliable poll (IMHO) from the Washington Free Beacon shows Cruz at 36, Trump at 31, and Kasich at 21 (12 percent undecided). Trump tends to perform well in open primaries as he draws a good amount of independent and Democrat support; however there is a Democrat open primary taking place in the state the same day, so the vast majority of Wisconsin Democrats will presumably vote in their own party's hotly-contested primary rather than cross over to vote in the GOP primary, and Bernie is likely to take a big chunk of the state's independent voters. Also, it is suspected that Governor Scott Walker will endorse Cruz right before primary day, which could give him a nice boost.

&gt; Prediction: Cruz 39%, Trump 35%, Kasich 26%.

**Tuesday, April 19th**

New York - 95 Delegates

Closed Primary - Winner-Take-Most (20% Threshold)

Analysis: This is Trump's home state, so it's obviously a must-win for him. The two most recent polls both show him with a big lead. Emerson has the race Trump 64, Cruz 12, Kasich 1 (23 percent undecided). A somewhat older poll from Siena had the race at Trump 45, Cruz 11, Kasich 18 (26 percent undecided). Trump wants to not only win the state, but ideally to also keep both Cruz and Kasich under 20%. I expect Rudy Giuliani to stump for Trump in the days leading up to the primary and to vouch for the candidate's national security/foreign policy credentials.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 59%, Kasich 23%, Cruz 18%.

**Tuesday, April 26th [*Still Sorta Super Tuesday*]**

Pennsylvania - 71 Delegates (including 54 unbound)

Closed Primary - Winner-Take-All

Analysis: The two most recent polls both show Trump ahead, but by widely differing margins. The older poll, from Harper, has it Trump 36, Kasich 10, Cruz 17 (37 percent undecided). The newer poll (by Franklin &amp; Marshall) has it Trump 33, Kasich 30, Cruz 20 (17 percent undecided). I put more faith in the more recent poll. However, I have about zero faith in Kasich's ability to actually *win* anywhere outside Ohio.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 39%, Kasich 36%, Cruz 25%.

Rhode Island - 19 Delegates

Semi-Closed Primary - Proportional (10% Threshold)

Analysis: A small number of delegates being divided up proportionately makes this contest the least important of the night (and month). There has been only one poll of this race, and it's from last month (by Brown University). It had Trump ahead with 43, Kasich in second with 14, and Cruz in third with 10 (Rubio was at 25 and Carson was at 3, with another 5 percent undecided). This poll is basically worthless since it's over a month old and it included two candidates who are no longer in the race. (I also have some difficulty believing a poll that shows only five percent undecided more than two months before a primary election.) So, my prediction is flying pretty blind in this contest.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 45%, Kasich 33%, Cruz 22%.

Maryland - 38 Delegates

Closed Primary - Winner-Take-All

Analysis: There is only one somewhat recent poll in this race, by the Baltimore Sun. It showed Trump at 34, Cruz at 25, and Kasich at 18 (Rubio was at 14, with another 9 percent undecided). This is the second-largest delegate haul of the night, and it's a winner-take-all state, so it's pretty important. Very hard to predict the race at this point, however. I will note this - Governor Larry Hogan, who has a 70% job approval rating, has publicly stated that he would have a difficult time supporting Donald Trump as the Republican Party's nominee. So, will Hogan perhaps endorse a fellow governor, John Kasich, right before the primary? It's certainly possible, and it's definitely something to keep in mind as we get closer to the primary election, as it has the potential to be a game-changer.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 37%, Kasich 36%, Cruz 27%.

Delaware - 16 Delegates

Closed Primary - Winner-Take-All

Analysis: The state of Delaware offers April's smallest batch of delegates, but it's winner-take-all, and every last delegate is going to be crucial as Trump tries to accumulate the magic number of 1,237 while seemingly every other political figure on the planet tries to stop him. I could find zero polls of this race. I guess I'll just assume it will be sort of a cross between Pennsylvania and Maryland.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 38%, Kasich 36%, Cruz 26%.

Connecticut - 28 Delegates (including 3 unbound)

Closed Primary - Winner-Take-Most (20% Threshold)

Analysis: There are no recent (as in, conducted this *year*) polls for this state's GOP primary election. Pretty sure it's not gonna be Cruz Country in Connecticut, though.

&gt; Prediction: Trump 42%, Kasich 39%, Cruz 19%.


**Conclusion:**

If my predictions are correct (a big if!), Ted Cruz will start the month of April with a big win in Wisconsin, and then manage to finish in third place in each of the month's six remaining contests. The Northeast just isn't that into him (not counting Maine, but that was a caucus, not a primary). Up until now, the only state where Kasich has gotten more than 30% of the vote was in his home state of Ohio. I think he'll have some strong showings next month, and perhaps even win a couple states, but I give Trump at least a slight edge in all of them.

For example, Carol could honestly say that she's killed over two dozen people...is that a good answer or a bad answer? Morgan has killed in the past but is a pacifist now...how would he answer, and would that be a ""passing"" or a ""failing"" answer?

As for ""why,"" wouldn't pretty much anyone say something along the lines of ""self-defense"" or ""to survive?""

I just don't get why these questions are supposed to be so vitally important to ask a person in order to determine whether or not they can be trusted. Maybe the comics explain it in more detail?

She says ""I can't even"" within 30 seconds. It only gets worse from there.
