4,"I sort of see this as a positive experience. I am high now, and I feel worse. I was enjoying sobriety. I was feeling happy. I was enjoying having emotions again and being motivated to do good things. I felt genuine and true.

And this decision took that away for today. I don't feel better now that I'm high, I feel disgusting, depressed, guilty, fearful, and disappointed. As my mother tells me she is proud of my sobriety.... my choice was wrong. 

It's like I just suffered 7 days in detox/rehab for NOTHING and I cannot let that shit be for nothing.

I'm going to use this feeling to stay away. Heroin brings you to a very dark place without you ever realizing it. And I realize it now, and I don't want it anymore. I do not want it.

So to take away some pain and guilt from this mistake I've made I'm gonna look at this as a motivating experience to learn from. Fuck that shit. ",2016-09-04 22:47:44+00:00,d79m52m,1.0,t3_516bnw,1587.0,Drugs

Even using the code name, Lucy, asking outright ""have you got any Lucy"" might still upset a drug dealer. My friends that deal are very paranoid and get upset with me when I'm too specific with my texts. Understandably, of course. If I was dealing illegal drugs I would want the least amount of physical evidence against me (texts).

A paranoid drug dealer also might think a stranger/acquaintance suddenly asking to buy drugs randomly might be an undercover cop and ignore you completely. 

The advice is good, I would just instead suggest sending a text saying ""Hey what's up its me, ____ I have a question, can I give you a ring?"" Then call him after he responds. Phone calls are a little more safe

Valium/diazepam is my favorite. It's the fastest, heaviest, and ugh I just feel sooo high and sleepy on it. It's wonderful.

Klonopin/clonazepam is next. I have a sense of ""not giving a fuck"" but I can stay awake usually. I find that klonopin is very good for social situations, it makes me super charismatic like I can say whatever I want.

217,"I don't mind the taste of MDMA either.

I have a theory. 

Most people I meet dislike the taste of MDMA and are very experienced using it. I've only rolled a few times and find that it's fine, but as I roll more, the taste seems to get funkier. I believe this is because your body has associated the taste of MDMA with the effects. Our bodies often want to reject MDMA as its not the healthiest thing for us and causes a strain on the body and brain. It's such a strong effect, that the body pairs the taste with the effect, and tries to repulse you with the taste, so that you will stay away from it. This theory makes sense to me because I used to smoke cigs. Then I did molly a handful of times, chainsmoked during the whole high, and now I can't smoke cigs as they are now disgusting and make me nauseous. Kinda like when you throw up after eating pizza you can never eat pizza again. 

That concept can also probably be applied to Kratom, or cough syrup, or certain types of alcohol....

Also, MDMA is bitter. Our taste buds specialized in tasting ""bitter"" objects are located at the back of the tongue, where people usually put drugs. I usually put mine in the middle of my tongue and can't taste it, but last Friday a rock rolled to the back of my tongue and the taste intensified tenfold. 

TL;DR - the more you do molly, the grosser it gets, among other drugs. And it tastes better on the middle/front of your tongue compared with the back. 

These are only my theories though, I have no other basis for coming to these conclusions.",2015-11-25 22:04:35+00:00,cxd2itm,1.0,t3_3u8a4c,21351.0,Drugs

I think there are alternatives to medication. I know for a fact when I went off my meds I had a hard time staying normal or quiet in school. I got in trouble and embarrassed myself a lot cause I had no self control. But now I was finally off the drug and able to start learning to cope with my urges to act out naturally. 

I'm nearly 21 now and I still struggle, but nonetheless, I think Ritalin and Adderall in my childhood is the cause of my lasting anxiety and zomebie-ish. I still have facial ticks and twitches too.

255,"Learn to deal with anxiety... I had awful anxiety when smoking but really wanted to smoke still. 

I used benzos to take the edge off. Until I got used to weed. It helped. But not everyone has benzos.

I suggest learning how to cope with anxiety in a way that suits you best. For some, it's breathing. For others, it's getting up and walking to the next room. For me, it's pausing and saying ""whew. I am absolutely alright right now. There is literally nothing threatening my health. This discomfort shall pass, and after I shall be happy."" I think positively. 

Listen to the others, too, about smoking less. One small hit is enough to begin with when you have no tolerance. Starting small is great. 

As for hallucinogens, no clue. Some people with anxiety do great, some don't. You have got to come to terms with potentially feeling anxiety, become okay with it, and find a way to relieve it that works for you. There's plenty of threads on Google with suggestions.

256,"Thank you soooo much for this advice. The actual act of dropping the tab and waiting to come up is, yes, already causing me severe anxiety because I feel like I'm going to worry myself into an attack like this. ""Holy shit. I just dropped acid. Oh man no going back. Fuck. fuck it's too late o my lands what have I done"" at least every time I imagine dropping it that's how anxious I get. I'm probably going to spend the whole come up going ""do I feel it? Do I feel anything? is that it? do I like it? do I dislike it? What if I dislike it?""

With MDMA, I spend my come up similarly. Before dosing I am riddled with anxiety. Then after dosing its ""Do I feel it? Is this unpleasant? Yes I've just decided this is unpleasant."" Then once I peak, from there on out I have the most fabulous time lol. If the same happens with acid then fine.

My brain just won't fucking stop. But. I loved your advice at the end about letting my friends know I'm anxious. They know I'm horrified of having a bad trip and they said they will give me all the water and blankets I need or whatever I'm wanting when I'm tripping. My anxiety builds when I don't voice it, so I think I will do that. I'll let them know that I'm feeling insanely anxious and they'll probably have some comforting things to say. 

My only fear is that they don't understand anxiety. Even though they're experienced trippers one of em says he's never had a bad trip and says i won't have one. That's clear misunderstanding of the emotion... 

Anyway thanks a lot for your advice. It feels really good being understood by an experienced, anxious tripper.

In the middle of the sea.
And there is no one.
No one,
Floating next to me.*

*There are waves 
Waves,
Though they do not move me.
I still stay here.
Right here,
And wait for something.*

*But nothing comes.
Nothing comes,
And I don't want it to.
Because no matter what happens,
There is nothing,
Nothing I want to do.*

*I am the only island here,
Floating here,
I am alone.
I want to be me,
Myself,
And stay my own home.*

*Cause once someone lives here,
Here with me,
I am not living for myself.
Once someone lives here,
My time,
Is now for someone else.*

I am not trying to rush that because I don't know what it would be just yet :) I'm moving away very soon so probably after that.

So its funny and reassuring you bring up nitrous actually saving someone from a bad trip because I had curiously considered this... I'm a 24/7 feelin-anxious kind of person, and nitrous made me realize it, as those 30 seconds were sooo freeeee of anxiety it was so blissful I could cry. I love getting rid of anxiety.

This made me realize that maybe when I'm tripping, if the world gets too crazy, I might knock the fear out with a whip it.

Only 4 in a day?? Ahh this makes me feel so much worse about my 25. Lol. I'm just gonna vowe never to do that again. ",2015-11-17 17:19:20+00:00,cx3gmgd,4.0,t1_cx3fvko,1092.0,Drugs

402,"Hey, your gf sounds a lot like me.

Anxiety/bad feeling on the come up of MDMA is really common, and happens to me aswell... with time, she will learn how to handle her anxieties on mdma - i find that mdma taught me how to handle anxiety.

Going into it, it's okay to remind yourself you might get anxious. And that it's fine if you do. Embrace the feeling while it runs it's course. I've found that fighting the anxiety or fighting the ""bad feeling"" or hoping that the bad feeling doesn't come, only makes it worse. It is easier and more freeing to say, ""yeaaa. I feel a little shitty right now. But I wanted to do this drug and it's about to be fun as fuck in a few minutes."" 

Being positive is insanely powerful when you are on MDMA. If a negative thought crosses my mind, I counteract it by saying a positive one back to myself and the vibe really lifts itself up.

Being in the moment during a shitty emotion is really beneficial. I try to remind myself, ""Hey. I feel bad but I'm here now. I popped that molly and now I'm with my friends at this rave like I wanted all week -- I did it, im here."" Truly being in the moment is a weightless feeling...

And since the come up is rough, find a safe cozy chair to sit in for the come up and drink water. Then once the anxieties pass, get up and dance!:} I find that after the come up, it's very hard to feel negative. 

Another helpful technique is to focus your anxieties outward. Instead of sitting and thinking inside about how you feel or how to feel better, try to channel your inner energy into the outside world by gripping stuff (feels great on molly), letting out big heavy sighs, talking, etc. Get that energy out of your chest and into the world.

And you, boyfriend, be there for her and squeeze her hand :} when I'm anxious on mdma my boyfriend's touch on my hands or face can really be soothing, or touching his hands or his face etc.

But most importantly, when the shitty feeling gets shitty just remember it's just the drug, it will pass, and above all else, EVERYTHING IS OKAY :}

553,"I explained explicitly that I don't know if it's from weed.

Obviously when I got the card, I got the card under the belief that smoking weed relieves the symptoms temporarily, which it does, not knowing weed could ever make anyone sick after the fact. Seeing as weed is actually used to treat nausea and lack of appetite in many conditions it reeeeally didn't seem that crazy. 

Up until a few days ago I hadn't even heard of this term and have just begun investigating. 

So, yeah, I got a medical mj card weeks ago and yeah I am done smoking for awhile. I was just seeking out answers to my curiosities about details of this condition to see how much it does or doesn't match me. 

I still am looking for answers to the above questions.
