It's killed my bank account and friendships and my life seems to have been put on pause.

So, as pressured by my parents, I went to a detox place for 6 days and tried to do residential rehab after that but left after 2 days I hated it, I realized I wasn't ready. Everyone there says ""You have to want sobriety for yourself. Not because someone else wants you to be. You'll never stay sober if inside you don't truly wish to be.""

So I left. Because I don't wanna be sober and also I am way too depressed right now to be without daily counseling. I wanted to kill myself at that rehab. No, I don't want my life to fall apart and get worse until I go to jail or die. I don't, heroin is disgusting.

But that huge part of me loves getting high. How do I beat that part of me down and let go? How do I stop thinking about all the nice, cozy times with heroin...

I had 8 days clean until today I blew it. Had some left over and did it. Wasn't even worth it really. I feel disgusted at myself. I'm a fucking idiot. Sobriety is better because emotions are so true and genuine and vibrant and I love them...why the hell did I fuck that up. fuck.

Which, I guess is kinda true, but not really. Molly (MDMA) makes me feel craaazy, crazy good like my brain is just gushing serotonin and I'm clenching my jaw and it hits my body really hard and yeah. 

Sass (MDA) was so much nicer.

The come up was so much more pleasant and gentle, I didn't take enough apparently to hallucinate really but things did look...enhanced. and if I stared at the wood long enough it would kinda move.

It was sooo much more emotional.... like I found myself feeling like I was tripping, but not so intense. Way less anxiety. Little things had big meanings. Like, I was thinking to myself while sitting outside that sass is nothing like I thought it would be - and that many things in life are that way. You have an expectation but you really don't know till you try...or get to know the person/thing etc.

Another huge difference I noticed was it was very.... naturey? If that makes sense. My friend and I sat down and gently played with little sprouting sunflowers, and it was just so glorious sitting under the trees. I felt VERY connected to the earth. I like to think it's because sass is a plant. Molly doesn't make me feel close to the earth but sass really did. I imagine it's like how acid doesn't connect you to the earth the same way shrooms do, chemical versus plant. That's just my opinion... I felt the sass root talking to me :)

I had beautiful, peaceful conversations with people... I wasn't clenching, idk, it just felt so true and nice. Kinda like tripping but also not really...less intense like I said, and it lasted longer than molly and I didn't need to take as much.

It honestly might be my new favorite drug, I just love the way it carried me so pleasantly.

My case is similar to many of yours or many you've heard; I destroyed myself taking too much molly.

I have always been a little anxious and depressed but it's been manageable until I abused molly. I used it roughly once a week for 4-5 months, usually taking .3 in a night give or take. I haven't touched it since December 14th or somethin but anyway, I'm destroyed. Depression and anxiety through the roof. I quit my job. I quit school. I broke up with my bf. I'm completely miserable and unfulfilled and I'm blaming my molly abuse. I understand time will heal my pain but when you're this miserable, waiting for time to pass can be excruciating.

I've been going to talk therapy and it's not any help. I still sob 5 times a day. So I'm gonna go to my psychiatrist and get medicated, since I clearly need a physical change. However, I am assuming they will prescribe me SSRI's, and I'm probably going to wanna do LSD again when I'm feeling better and I'm going to wanna try molly again one day in the far future, and honestly who knows what other drugs I will fuck with between now and ??? Ya know? And SSRI's are NOT okay with rolling, and fuck with tripping right?

My questions:

How do SSRI's interfere with lsd? Cause maybe I can just give up molly for good but I definitely want to do lsd again. 

And I'm also wondering if you guys know about any depression meds that don't interfere with mdma or lsd or other drugs.

And my final question, I was thinking I'd honestly just say to my psychiatrist ""hey, I'm depressed and need meds. But honestly, I anticipate myself experimenting with molly or lsd again in the future because I'm a 21 year old college student."" Then, based off of that, she could work with me. But I'm afraid she will think ""Drug addict. Can't trust her or prescribe her benzos anymore!"" Aren't you not supposed to act like a total drug enthusiast to your psychiatrist? idk.

I posted on here yesterday whining about how depressed I've been lately and how i am scared to trip cause of it. I've had to take a semester off from school, I've quit my job, broken up with my boyfriend, etcetera. I *am* planning to go back to school in 5 months or so but don't know what to do or where to go anymore.

So I'm directionless. I'm very anxious. I'm very depressed. I'm stressed out. These are all... poor mindsets for a trip.

However, I'm using this semester for personal growth. I've got a new therapist and I'm trying to figure myself out... but it's so hard. I'm so confused and sad. I just wanna feel beauty in my heart again, I wanna find the right direction...

So, thats where LSD comes in. I've tried it only one time, over a month ago when things were going better. I did one tab. It was very fun, I was with good company, but definitely intense and confusing sometimes...

I have 2 tabs right now, off the same sheet from last time. I am considering taking one or maybe one and a half, and tripping either alone or with my very close friend. I don't have many friends to call up though. For this trip, I am looking to go on a nature walk, explore my inner self, work through some things, and maybe experience some bad feelings but hopefully come out the other end with more insight.

The only thing is, I'm inexperienced and anxious. I don't want to throw myself into a bad trip I can't stop (although I was pretty good at controlling my mindset last time). 10 hours is a very lengthy time to be feeling pain if things don't go well.

So I ask any of you that have experience with psychedelics and depression/anxiety, or using psychedelics as a type of inner therapy, for advice or guidance on this scenario. What type of things do you do when you know you're planning to work through some demons during your trip?

Anyway this was maybe I don't know, 3-4 weeks ago? And it was my first and only trip.

My dab rig keeps breaking and I'm poor and lazy so I keep gluing it back together with gorilla glue. The piece I keep gluing though is the piece that holds the nail SO the glue gets heated up occasionally I would guess..

Yesterday after gluing it back together for the 4th? time, I noticed that there was a fat chunk of dried glue where the nail belongs. (Gorilla glue expands after it dries so it ends up in unintended places).

Had I not noticed the glue chunk, I would have vaporized it with my nail and smoked it on accident most likely after heating the nail.

Realizing that, I realized I probably already have inhaled melted glue fumes a few times out of that bong...

I'd always been curious about dmt, and finally had the chance to try it today, as our friend had some pure white dmt!

I was ridiculously anxious going into it. So I wasn't really holding in my hits long enough cause I was kind of scared. Failed a few times, saw only gentle rippling of things after the first few bowls, along with undertones of tranquility... I definitely didn't hold it in long enough. 

So this time my boyfriend, ""james"" lights it for me. I hold it in. ""The walls turned pink"" I start to say, but he shushes me and tells me to hold it in longer, so I do. At this point I'm incredibly captivated by the colorful video we're watching, but I can't shake the creepy visuals in my periphery, lol, eyes were faintly appearing all over everything. My anxiety got a little high here but I told myself the eyes weren't real, so it was fine.

James took the bowl and hit what was left after I was done. I laid back and felt really... intense is the only word for it. Haha. James and I were laying back, glued to the couch holding hands, watching a colorful cartoon music video on TV... in the music video, people were watching TV of people watching TV, quite a trippy video I'll try to find the link. Anyway it tripped me out because me and James in that moment were also PEOPLE WATCHING TV. it was cool. I told him I felt like we were those people and he agreed. 

The room around me, my reality, just seemed like a very odd altered version of reality. Not quite like acid but similar. Things seemed far away, etc. The visuals were very pleasing.

When I realized I could see shapes when my eyes were closed, I was happiest. It was amazing. I closed my eyes and saw the most intricate geometric patterns - it really is amazing that our brains can create that. It was really satisfying.

Weird feelings of anxiety and depression soon came after while I waited for the mini trip to end. It did. I was disappointed that I didn't hit the pipe correctly, thus resulting in a weaker trip but I figure another day I will have the opportunity. :)

So I'm familiar with weed and molly and nitrous, but I've only done acid one time, and nothing else, so I don't have a lot of psychedelic experience.

I have anxiety, so I'm scared to trip alone. My only time I tripped with my best friend who also tripped for the first time, on a hike while my bf trip sat us.

I really enjoyed the visuals, the outdoors, the adventure. I hated being indoors, or when I got stuck thinking too long inside my head (which I fear would happen if I tripped alone)

Now that was two weeks or so ago and I'm moving away in a week so I wanted to do acid this weekend one more time.

However, boyfriend doesn't want to do acid and friends aren't available but honestly I love the way acid made me look at the world. I just wanna go back outside and see the wonky world stretch and brighten with color and connect me with the earth lol...

Boyfriend has experience tripping numerous times on numerous substances, he's just over it. He is happy to trip sit me though. So I'm thinking I'll just drop acid and go on a hike with him and he can trip sit me.

I just worry about feeling isolated or alone like, ""I'm tripping and no one else is."" Or having awkward moments with my sober bf. Last time he tripsit me though, it was great interacting with him I didn't feel weird, even though we were on different levels... I just wonder if not having a tripping friend along this time will make things weird. 

I'm scared that our conflicting interests will ruin things for me and make things awkward. I'll be like ""look at that fucking tree dude"" and he can only be like ""yeah its pretty cool..."" haha ya know?

I have anxiety and depression. Wooohooo. I like weed and mdma but they do make it worse.

I'm kinda on edge 24/7 so I was very reluctant to try LSD but I DID IT and it was awesome (I posted a trip report the other day.) If I had to sum it up, I'd say LSD just makes you more YOU, and makes you feel the feelings you already have more hardcore.

It was fun while I was preoccupied running around, but every now and then when I'd slow down, my vibe would be like ""wtf"" and I would feel uncomfortable, or wrong, or anxious for a second. Like sorta on edge. Then I'd worry about having a bad trip. Luckily it was easy to push those thoughts aside, say ""you're fine"" and then look at the pretty clouds.

Until the end, I was veryyyy tired. About 7 hours into the trip, the mental and physical exhaustion made me sore and depressed, which was amplified by the acid, which made me a little anxious. I wanted the trip to end. 7 hours was enough for me (perfect timing for shrooms!)

Throughout the whole trip, little things would bother me. Getting in the car or going indoors (small spaces) made me uncomfortable. The wrong type of music made me feel creeped out. Certain parts of videos we watched would make me feel weird too, if it wasn't light hearted enough. But as long as we kept moving and hiking around it was great.

I LOVED watching the clouds spiral, the grass shift, the visuals were so fuckin sick. They were serene. I loved the distortion in perception of my surroundings, and the goofiness of it. I wanted to be goofy and laugh and yell. A couple times I'd get a weird thought like ""What if all along XYZ was just a delusion"" or some silly thought and it would weird me out. I didn't like being weirded out by weird fucky thoughts. I did however enjoy reflecting on life and crying at its beauty.

I loved playing, and the visuals, and music... HD vision in nature is so sick. I just wanted it to be shorter in duration, and easier to sleep on. Which makes me think shrooms!! Plus shrooms sound fun to try anyway :) however I hear they are more mindfucky and harder to control, and as I described above I was very pleased with my ability to control my acid trip and am not sure how anxious me would do with a more rigid substance...

Though it is important to remember I've only tried acid one time, next time could be very different!

So I ask yallz. For those of you that get trip anxiety, and did pretty good on acid, how are ya with shrooms? What is your advice? What are your comparisons?

So. I've spent months on this sub asking how to trip without anxiety. 

I have really bad anxiety, I've sworn off weed a few times. I didn't think I would *ever* have any guts or desire to trip. But once I got used to weed again LSD peeked my curiosity. 

Since then I almost did acid a few times but flaked out, I was just too afraid. But after months of talking to you guys on here, I finally decided to do it at my house with my best friend of nearly 8 years, ""Mara.""

I don't know how strong the tabs were, unfortunately... I'm assuming they weren't too high in dosage as I kept my grip pretty well?

So we drop at 11am. I'm like, shit I can't believe I did this. Haha. Immediately we realize we don't really have much to do inside to entertain ourselves while we wait to come up and I'm nervous/anxious as balllzz, it's cold and mucky outside.

We start watching adventure time, which I don't really watch but Mara wanted to. It was kinda creeping me out after a while, 30 minutes had gone by and I felt weird haha. 

Mara wasn't feeling anything, we decide to go out to her car for fresh air. We stand up and I start going in this weird loop of ""let me get all my stuff before we go. Let's go. Wait. Do I have my stuff. Let me get my stuff. Let's go. Wait."" Repeat. I just had really nervous energy.. Then I got really sick and threw up 3 times in the toilet, tried to go outside for fresh air, puked again in my hand so it wouldn't get on the carpet. 

Haha so now I'm tripping at this point. I feel big compared to Mara. Like the ice king. My nervous energy freaked Mara out, so she suggested I call my sober boyfriend, ""Josh,"" over to trip sit us, cause she didn't think we could handle it alone lol.

I'm like GREAT IDEA! Cause I was missing him anyway... so I go to call him and realized I've missed a text from him  awhile ago through the puke madness. It says ""I just smoked DMT on accident."" I almost started panicking haha he was supposed to be on standby but now he's tripping on dmt! I guess it was residue on a dab bong or something I don't know.

Luckily dmt doesn't last long and Josh made it over probably half an hour later. By this time, Mara and I had migrated to our cars in the parking lot for fresh air and were looking at the [most beautiful leaf.](http://i.imgur.com/C5vNNRi.jpg)

The purple spots were moving around inside the little leaf, and it's lime green veins were moving about. It was beautiful. 

My boyfriend walks in on the scene, pleased to see us enjoying and giggling with our little leaf in the parking lot. He decides to take us on a drive to this beautiful park by my house. The windows are down and a lady in the church parking lot waves to me. It's fucking hilarious to me, she is sober, just got out of church and has no idea I'm trippin balls. I crack up and say ""hi there lady.""

Once we get to the park, I'm amazed because I've been here a million times but today it's so different. The world is huge. The other people at the park seemed to be miles away. And nature. Fucking nature. Everything was sooo bright and green. We came across this weird puddly rock (it had been raining recently) and the colors were shifting around so beautifully, I can't really describe it. HD vision for sure.

While we're walking around, it starts to rain which is fucking awwwesssome. It then started hailing chunks down on us. It was beautiful and fun but I was a bit stuck in my head during that time. It was beautiful to see the other people at the park, freaking out and laughing in the hail...

I just felt like a little elf in the woods, kept getting distracted by nature and it's shifting colors. At one point, once it was done raining, I looked up at the clouds and the sun was shining through behind it, it was huge, massive, it looked like heaven, while [Cosmic Sense](https://soundcloud.com/future/cosmic-sense-midnight) played in the background. 

We stopped by my house, where my beautiful yet grumpy cat rejected my love and hurt my feelings, but Josh assured me he was just preoccupied doing cat things. 

Later, we went to Josh's house. He lives up on a hill so we hiked around with his dog, who is AN AMAZING TRIP BUDDY. He was just so happy to be hugged. I loved seeing him so joyful :)

I was looking at the clouds again, and watching their tips spiral and move when Josh played [this amazing song.](https://soundcloud.com/thepolishambassador/koyelia-ft-peia) I swear the cloud started dancing with the song, the visuals were one with the rhythm. It was blissful. I cry now listening to it again hahah. 

A bit later now at 6pm or so I'm mentally exhausted and take a valium to end the trip and sit down for a while. My boyfriend walks in front of me for a moment and it was like I saw him for the first time... I saw him for what he is as a person, and it was so beautiful. I thought about all his genuine kindness and generosity and love all in one bundle of of a human.... Sheer beauty. I started crying and told him I just felt like I saw him for the first time...he was touched and Mara thought it was cute.

We tried whippits, it was pretty trippy. Made me giggle at EVERYTHING. Especially Nate Bernot videos...Game seven something bout a haircut. I recommend. Although he kinda yells at you which got uncomfortable after awhile haha.

I shared a lot of giggles and love with Mara and Josh and nature... learned some ugly things bout myself I hope to change. It was so beautiful knowing I could conquer my anxiety that's been preventing me for so long, and have a mostly pleasant trip. I won't lie there were uncomfortable moments but it was such a fucking blessing either way. I wanted to experience this for so long.

The advice I've got from you guys on this sub helped me more than yall know and i love you, myself, and life... I'm touched. Haha. 

You guys are all right when you say acid let's you see the world for what it is and let's you be who you truly are. I felt so right and true. Which can be scary at times...

Afterward I found out Mara didn't have visuals, no colors shifted and moved around for her...I thought was odd but she loved her trip anyway.

Anyway reddit I didn't think it was possible someone like me could experience the beauty of lsd but I did. The amount of thoughts were overwhelming a lot of the time, so I could see this being an occasional thing. I don't know.

I've known her for about 10 years now, she's never tripped either. She's not anxious like me, but she's a little nervous of course. It's going to be only us two, and my boyfriend who is an experienced tripper knows we will be tripping and is going to be standing by at his house in case I need to call or whatever. 

We are each going to do one tab. My other friend is the dealer and they had a blast on it, they don't know the dosage but it sounds like it's in the 100ug-150ug range.

Anyway, this Saturday we both have the whole day off so we're going to drop around 11am or noon probably. The only thing is, it's going to be raining outside that day so we're going to have to spend at least *some* of the trip indoors.

My mom is going to be away for most of the day Saturday and I've told her I'm going to be having a thing with my friend... but that doesn't mean she won't drop by, I imagine she probably will, to grab some stuff, and then leave again...

I really don't want this to ruin my trip. So I'm looking for advice. We can't go to my friends house. So we have the beautiful, cold, rainy outdoors, and my apartment. My mom doesn't talk to me very often. If we just stay and chill in my room, she probably won't even realize we're home and we could chill till she leaves. But... I don't wanna ruin my first trip by worrying about her dropping in. I feel like I'm an adult though so it might not be a big deal.

This is something I have always wanted to talk about. But I have not had anyone to talk to about it. I would love to hear from those of you familiar with the subject or those of you with a history of stimulant usage.

Someone posted on this sub about adderall affecting them differently, less enjoyably so. This inspired this topic back in me again.

When I was 5 years old, I was prescribed adderral, or Ritalin, or some other generic off brand. I've taken them all, switching brand to brand, anything to make me happier. I remember my parents saying I had to take this little pill because I'm too energetic. 

And it is true. I have ADHD. But not the kind that's over diagnosed, not the fake kind. I am the utterly loud, uncontrollable, impulsive, annoying type of ADHD.

I took the pill every single day, forcibly, until I was 13 years old. So, roughly 10 years of my developing life.

I was unhappy and empty. I didn't want to talk to anybody. It was a nuisance to even interact with friends. I was an empty zombie, and I had NO DESIRES. I wanted nothing from life, making me often very bored and unfulfilled.

I never ate. Food was just not something I could enjoy or be interested in no matter how hard I tried. So I starved. Every day, until the effects wore off at dinner.

I twitched, had facial ticks, had body ticks... I would twitch my eyes so hard they would be too sore to blink. Everyone at school loved to ask about why I twitched.

I had panic attacks every single night from the age of 8 to the age of 12. Full fledged panic attacks full of tears and impending doom and staying up crying to my mom till 2 am. This, may have had nothing to do with the drug, but is interesting.

Finally when I was going into highschool, I begged my parents to let me quit taking this awful piece of shit drug. They finally caved. I still dont forgive them for taking so long. No fucking fourth grader should be running around on speed.

Anyway, i spent 10 years of my childhood on fucking stimulants. I never thought much of it, just was happy to be done with it.

But I'm 20 now. And I still twitch. My eyes still get sore sometimes. I still can't eat until dinner. I happily starve until then. 

Sometimes, I still can't feel anything.. I'm still a zombie sometimes. And I'm ridden with anxiety 24/7. I have very few desires and am fulfilled by very few things. Food and sex are nothing to me. Though I do love people still. Socializing is my thing....

Anyways... Some days I think it might be depression. Some days I think I'm just playing it up in my head. But some days I can't stop thinking about the damage stimulants must have on a developing adolescents brain.

I was forming habits at that age, that the drug caused. My appetite, my ticks... they all stuck with me, I believe, because they were strongly embedded and wired into my childhood brain. Now I can't shake the habits, even in the absence of the drug...

Anyway... I don't know. I just wanted to see what you guys had to say about all this.

I just turned 21.
My good friend is 20. And she has a 2 year old son, who's a very precious little child. 

For months, me and Friend have been talking about moving 5 hours away from here together. Because I am going away to college, and she is getting kicked out of her house. We agreed we would be roomies in the college town I'm moving to.

She has no job. She is an avid marijuana smoker like myself. I don't know how she takes care of her kid currently. I think it's from the support of her family.

Time went on, and I realized as a 21 year old college student, my endeavors may be limited in the future because I live with a mother and her 2 year old child. I could see smoking inside being an issue, friends of mine, but strangers to her coming over being an issue... kickbacks, get togethers... No one wants strangers around their kid. 

I know she would ask me to babysit, and I'm her friend, I should be there for that... but to be honest, I want to be in college. Doing my thing. I want to be 21. I want my house to be littered with bongs, not baby toys. I know that sounds horrible. But I only get this experience once and I'm freshly 21 and working to get my bachelors, and my lifestyle doesn't mix with a baby.

Not to mention, she has no job. And it's hard to find work as a single mom. Especially in a town 5 hrs away. How can I rely on her to pay rent??

So, I told her that she should move up with me, but room with somebody else. She simply said, ""No way. I have a kid. I can't live with someone random. But thanks for being honest so I'm not getting my hopes up for something that's not going to happen."" 

And it crushed me. The move is in under 2 months. So I said, ""look, I'm really stressed out about all this, I'll get back to you later today."" And I never replied. I'm at a total loss of how to tell her I don't wanna live with her because she is unreliable and will limit my experience, because those are really insulting and selfish reasons. And she has had friends deny her as a roommate in the past as well for being unreliable. I feel like a piece of shit. What do I tell her?

Reminded me of my last panic attack just with weed. It was also when I was taking a shit... stuck on the toilet.

I realized that coming up on drugs and having to isolate yourself to take a shit is just a dangerous combination man. You're like okay let's make this quick. AHH NO I'M STUCK. WHAT IF I WILL SHIT IN HERE FOREVER?? AHHH

So after this lil poop attack I'm rolling my balls off and I'm like I need to tell reddit about the poop revelation. Why?!? Cause I'm on molly. Hahah. And cuz it's really important and funny to me right now. Someone NEEDS TO KNOW RIGHT AWAY. And if I don't tell reddit, I'll tell someone else like my boyfriend and all his friends that are here.

Well turned out I'm way too fucked up to be posting on reddit so I just gave up. Sat down. And sure nuff 5 minutes later I'm like yall look I'm sorry but man coming up while you're taking a shit is some shit. So I ended up telling them the shit story. It was alright.

Anyways, now like 6 hours later everyone is asleep including my boyfriend and I am still rollin rollin rollin so HENCE I CREATED THE SHIT POST",Drugs,Here is my taking drugs + taking a shit = panic attack revelation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3r35l6/here_is_my_taking_drugs_taking_a_shit_panic/

I don't usually puke on the come-up with molly, but I do usually get a little anxious and nauseous. But I know all that is common, so it doesn't bother me.

I have almost puked once before, but I swallowed it back down.

Last time though oh lord it was a puke fest. I only took 1 point. Maybe .12 at the most. I was starting to roll and it was unpleasant, as my come-ups aways are.... the intensity grew until I upchucked, three times, everything I had. And immediately my tummy ache, along with my roll, was gone.

I had a lingering roll, you know, jaw clenching and desire for music but it wasn't the OMG I'M ROLLING that I puked up. 

I wanted to redose right away but the puke wasnt fun and i always wait a while to redose. After that, I couldn't really get the effects I wanted, I think cause I waited too long to redose.

My question is, next time I puke up my point, is it safe to just go ahead and pop another point after? Or maybe better, a half point?? Or is it maybe possible that if I throw up early, I'll lose more of my roll than if I throw up later, and so redosing really depends on when I puke and how much I feel it still after? I dunno guys.

I'm excited to feel the deep, meaningful feelings on acid and bonding with friends, looking at the world with new eyes, yeaaa kno. Though, the thought of hallucinations are abit scary.

But I need help with one thing. 

What do I do if I drop the tab and I just don't like it? What if it turns out I just don't enjoy hallucinating, the high, any of it. If I don't like how it feels.

I smoke tons of weed, I absolutely love MDMA, I've done milder things like coke, but I have never touched a psychedelic or a dissociative, as I am an anxious person and I'm trying to build up the guts to try one sometime when I feel ready.

The only time I have hallucinated was on a high dose of mdma, where I saw vivid trails of my surroundings, and it was very intense and overwhelming. Though I was rolling my balls off.

I've been rolling much too often lately, so I'm taking a break right now. However there is this haunted renegade thing I wanna go to this Friday. And I wanna get shwifty, but I still wanna be able to socialize, walk around a bit, etc. For those of you that don't know, a renegade is an outdoor event where we will be outside from like 9pm to 7am partying all night listening to electronic music. Sometimes we bring the tent sometimes we sleep in the car. The car is a fun place to hang.

Anyway, I'm interested in mescaline personally for its similarity to MDMA but boyfriend suggested K, and now K has my interest a little bit too.

But first, some questions about K.

I think I would be wanting to do a **low dosage** because we will be at a renegade, and I understand high doses are more debilitating. Also, my first time should be a low dose I'd imagine. 

So I'm wondering how a low dose feels on K? I really only read about the high dose trips online, not much is to be said about low doses. Thoughts?

Can you walk around and chat with your friends on low doses of K? If not, I wouldn't mind getting stuck in the car for an hour or so with my boyfriend -- gettin stuck places is funny sometimes, and my car is a safe place.

Also, spiraling into a bad trip or anxiety doesn't seem too likely on a low dose of K either, am I right about that? I'm avoiding acid for now due to this fear but k is a different ballpark I'm thinkin.

Oh and how does it interact with alcohol? I might get a little tipsy beforehand to pregame my nerves away.

Weed used to give me severe anxiety but I've learned to cope, never happens now. Molly gives me anxiety on the come up but I cope with that alright as well.

I've had awful panic attacks on weed though, so I know the power of getting stuck in a bad place when your mind is altered. 

I've been wanting to try a hallucinogen. I was thinking acid -- because i hear its clearer, I'm less concerned about having a bad trip on acid than on shrooms. It sounds easier to handle. Shrooms I hear are a more deeply rooted anxiety. Bigger mindfuck. Harder to come out of.

BUT -- dropping acid is frightening too, because it lasts for 5 fucking hours or so. (Edit: pardon me, much longer than 5 hours). If I decide I don't like it within an hour, I have a long way to go. And that in itself might freak me out on the trip. 

Last time I did mdma/molly I'm pretty sure there was some MDA/sass in there because I was seeing vivid, crisp, trails of everything in front of me. If I waved my hand, a perfect, dancing trail of waved behind it. And I felt like my body was moving with the trails. I could be wrong, but either way I was seeing shit.

I decided it was very overwhelming, I wasn't so sure I liked seeing shit that wasn't there. It's one thing to comprehend you're gonna hallucinate on drugs and it's another to see it in fucking front of you. So, I closed my eyes till the trails left. The closed eye visuals were much less intense, just colored lines. Haha it was so weird how your mind does it on its own, I don't know how I feel about it!

So that said -- I still want to experience everything. I want to experience psychedelics for their perspective changing beauty and because I want to explore new experiences before I die....

But, I'd like to dip my toes in first before diving into a 6+ hour trip of insanity. I want a better idea of what I'm getting into.

I love MDMA, I've used it roughly 5 times now give or take. I was bad this month (though I'm on a break now) and did it a couple times over a short period so I was feeling my tolerance go down.

So when my boyfriend and I went to this renegade Friday night, we decided we should eat a point and a half instead of just one point (our usual dose).

This ends up being a shitty and also amazing idea, given how potent these moonrocks were.

We were a little early to the renegade (which is an outdoor rave in the middle of the woods basically), so we were just sitting in the car waiting for the music to start when we ate our rocks.

His point and a half consisted of a few rocks, mine was just one solid rock I swallowed whole. 

Within half an hour, we're sitting in my car, im on his lap in the driver seat, and he says he's rolling his balls off. I think, ""that sucks, I feel nothing."" 

After a while he says he needs to get out the car and get fresh air. Things were escalating quickly for him. He sat next to my car leaning on my knee with his head down, obviously suffering from really bad come up anxiety, telling me he is rolling way too hard, and trying not to vomit. While the whole time, I'm totally sober.

I give up on getting high with him after about an hour, and try to relax him by cuddling him. Next thing I know I open my eyes annd the whole fucking world is trails. Everywhere. My big fat rock had finally dissolved. 

It was a lil dark in the car, so I didn't get to look at light trails; instead, I saw vivid, distinct, crisp trails of literally everything. I waved my hand and watched it's trails dance behind it, and it felt like my body was trailing along with everything too in rhythm. The whole world was alive and it was... overwhelming as fuck, so I just closed my eyes and layed back in the most sedated, deep molly high ever. But when I closed my eyes to get away, there were little blue and green and red choppy lines that danced on my eyelids. This tripped me out a little.

We proceeded to lay in the front seat of the car like melted puddles, occasionally moaning from the molly pleasure, or getting stuck staring into eachothers massive pupils, but not much else. Ahah we probably looked so funny. 

After another hour of this, we finally get out the car and suddenly the party is BUMPIN. Things escalated quickly during the 2 hours we got stuck in the car. Haha, so we moved on with our night and had a great time outside of the car.

But yeah, those visuals man. I've never tried a hallucinogen before. And ive never had molly get me like that before, so that was my first time seeing shit -- and I had actually been planning on trying acid soon but damn idk how much I like hallucinating anymore!

I am really new to all of this, so if I seem naive or ill-informed just know I'm still learning and that's why I'm here!

So, growing up in highschool I only fucked with weed. And it gave me horrible anxiety a couple times so I quit. I was so scared of weed. But I enjoyed the effects when I wasn't anxious, so I quit on and off.

Due to that, I never tried harder drugs. No molly no nothing. If I couldn't hand weed I figured I couldn't handle anything else.

Well, I am 20 now, much more mature, and I started smoking weed again 8 months ago and I'm great with it. I smoke it everyday, all the time, can't get ""too high"" anymore. When I get too high, I have a grip on my anxiety. I've had slight super stoned anxiety a couple times but it's sooo tolerable and miniscule. This whole experience has been awesome-- because I have become very good at managing anxiety, sober or stoned.

So I tried molly -- I fucking loved it, however, my first 2 rolls were so very intense that there was quite a bit of anxiety during the ""come up."" Both times I mostly kept my cool, and found ways to cure it quickly. The anxiety was really unenjoyable of course, but the more I did molly, the more I found ways to cope with and fix the come up anxiety. And very quickly molly quit making me anxious. And when it does give me a lil anxiety, I am very good at coping now as I've gotten to know the drug, and I'm learning from myself very well how to manage anxiety from all this.

Now... I love drugs, at least molly. But I can't do it all the time. It's not healthy.

Yet these fun festivals and shows happen so often, and Molly has really expanded my mind a bit. I find the happy, open, free-love mindset lasting weeks after the drug. It is a bonding, enlightening thing and I know psychedelics are even only more enlightening...

But despite the enlightening and fun and trippy shit, they don't mix well with the weak minded or those prone to anxiety I would imagine.

I wouldn't drop acid or eat shrooms right now because of that, ""What if I have a bad trip?"" Feeling. I'm just not ready. I've had bad marijuana highs when I was in highschool where I was MISERABLE WITH MY ANXIETY and I'm not tryna go back there on harder drugs.

But I'm slowly opening up as a person as I continue on. I haven't FREAKED OUT in a hot minute, I'm growing older, more mature, more easygoing....

So my questions are, what are some fun drugs that i have less risk of freaking the fuck out on?

Or maybe, if anyone wants to share their experiences with acid/shrooms and anxiety??? And how you overcame it or some advice?

Been experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, sour stomach, lack of appetite, and a lot of shitty painful empty stomach aches. Started 4 months ago when I began smoking weed heavily and incidentally 2 months after beginning zoloft and tegretol. They are progressively worsening to frequent vomiting of projectile clear fluid, weakness from lack of nutrition, Yada ya.


My questions:

1. Is it possible to develop CHS within only a year of heavy, heavy smoking?

2. How many days of abstaining from cannabis does it usually take for one to feel relief?

3. When the user returns to smoking after some recovery of symptoms, do the symptoms come right back?

4. How can marijuana cause a lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting when it is usually thought to do the opposite?

5. Anymore info you can give me, please, feel free. A couple months after becoming a heavy heavy user the symptoms began slowly, so I got a medical mj card for my recurring vomiting and nausea and inability to eat, and have found temporary relief when high, but after the fact, I plunge right back into illness.

Edit: I got my mj card weeks ago when I was oblivious to the fact that weed could cause nausea. I did not think it was from weed at the time. I have only just begun speculating and that is why I am stopping for a while, and trying to get answers about this weird condition.

I dont even know if i have this, but ive got to trouble shoot. Today I am beginning a temporary abstinence from weed, but given the lack of research, I'm having a hard time getting answers.

**TL;DWR** I smoke a lot of weed and can't get high off it so now I smoke 1 bowl a night to try and lower the tolerance. But is 1 bowl a night gonna lower it even or do I need to go cold turkey for a few days?

I'm an every day weed smoker. I started smoking mehh 4 months ago. Went from zero smoking to total stoner. Fabulous right. But my tolerance sky rocketed. 

I used to get way too high off just one hit of shitty leafy bud. ONE LOVELY LITTLE HIT. imagine how far an ounce gets you when you smoke like that.

Now i have to smoke like 6 bowls of top-shelf weed from the club. In California. Just for a buzz. I eat entire brownies, and don't feel a damn thing. I couldn't even fall asleep after my last brownie lol.

I have never met anyone that can out-smoke me. Which, despite what I used to think, is totally not a cool thing. I wanna be high off one bowl. Not 5

Yeah, so. Naturally I'm sad because i haven't actually felt high in weeks despite the fact that I've been actively smoking.

Also I should mention I'm on tegretol and Zoloft which I think is what let's me be this fucking immune to weed sometimes

So why not smoke for a few days yea? Well, I've been tryin. It's not that hard, but I actually have a horrific appetite condition and I happily won't eat for days and days, and weed remedies this.

So instead of going 2 or 3 days straight without smoking - I've been smoking only one or two bowls just at night at that's it. I haven't been getting high off of it but it puts me to sleep. My question is are these little one-bowl nights even helping my tolerance or do I need to be legit cold turkey for a few days? 

I miss being a solid {6} at least!! I only get to a 3 these days...

* never dabbed, never purchase oils, open to the idea but for some reason im afraid of dabs after hearing bad stories annnnd i feel like flower/herb is a sacred type of high...",trees,Guys... my tolerance is fucked up.

Edibles make me freak out. They don't give me a head high but they make my body tense up and feel incredibly nervous. So it's sorta unfortunate given that those are a pretty convenient way to discretely consume.

I've considered vaporizers, but looking into other stuff too. I don't really want a body high like edibles, more looking for a classic high you'll get from smoking flower.
