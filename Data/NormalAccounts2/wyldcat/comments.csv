8,"&gt; At an Alt-Right conference being held, of all places, in a federal building in Washington D.C., Spencer didn't even attempt to hide his bigotry and anti-Semitism.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the NY Times, He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the ""children of the sun,"" a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J. Trump, were ""awakening to their own identity.""
&gt; 
&gt; As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazi salute. When Mr. Spencer, or perhaps another person standing near him at the front of the room — it was not clear who — shouted, ""Heil the people! Heil victory,"" the room shouted it back.

&gt; 
&gt; **""This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.""**

Which is pretty straightforward to what he means: it's clear that a nation state is behind it, to attempt to achieve a specific effect of the election. What that effect is is also pretty clear (to sway the election), but he doesn't talk about outcome just that they tried to achieve a specific effect.

Then at Halifax he said:

&gt; Host: I'm interest in whether you're, essentially saying Russia achieved what it wanted in Donald Trumps victory?
&gt; 
&gt; Rogers: No I certainly didn't talk about outcome or effect, I talked about effort, desire and intent, which is different than outcome. I agree with senator McCain who said earlier ""I didn't really think it achieved.... and I agree with that statement, I don't think in the end it had the effect they potentially hoped that it might.

Here the host asks if Russia achieved the effect they wanted from hacking the election. Rogers reminds him that he didn't talk about outcome previously but only desire and intent and says that he thinks Russia didn't achieve the effect **they** wanted because the hacks and DNC emails didn't sway the election that much, just a tiny bit.

Also worth mentioning is that the DNC noticed they'd been compromised in April, hired Crowdstrike in May and it became a story in June and the rest is history. ",2016-11-21 00:32:57+00:00,da8v414,6.0,t1_da8siha,3586.0,politics
23,"What do you mean ""before they had proof""? What's that based on? The DNC noticed in April that they had been compromised and Crowstrike started to investigate and expelled the threat from the DNC servers in May already. 

&gt; [Cyber attacks that successfully penetrated the DNC computing system began in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks). Attacks by ""Cozy Bear"" began in the summer of 2015. Attacks by ""Fancy Bear"" began in April 2016. It was after the ""Fancy Bear"" group began their activities that the compromised system became apparent the groups were presumed to have been spying on communications, stealing opposition research on Donald Trump, as well as reading all email and chats. 

&gt;Both were finally identified by CrowdStrike in May 2016. Both groups of intruders were successfully expelled from the DNC systems within hours after detection. These attacks are considered to be part of a group of recent attacks targeting U.S. government departments and several political organizations, including 2016 campaign organizations.
____

&gt; ""Cozy Bear"" had access to DNC systems since the summer of 2015; and ""Fancy Bear"", since April 2016. There was no evidence of collaboration or knowledge of the other's presence within the system. Rather, the ""two Russian espionage groups compromised the same systems and engaged separately in the theft of identical credentials"".[4][22][24] ""Cozy Bear"" employed the ""Sea Daddy"" implant and a ""Power Shell"" backdoor launching malicious code enabled at various times and in various DNC systems. ""Fancy Bear"" employed X Agent malware which enabled distant command execution, transmissions of files and keylogging, as well as the ""X-Tunnel"" malware. DNC leaders became aware of the compromise in April 2016.

&gt; The DNC commissioned the cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike, to defeat the intrusions. Its Chief Technology Officer, Dmitri Alperovitch, who is also a cybersecurity expert stated:
&gt; 
&gt; CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016[...] We've had lots of experience with both of these actors attempting to target our customers in the past and know them well. In fact, our team considers them some of the best adversaries out of all the numerous nation-state, criminal and hacktivist/terrorist groups we encounter on a daily basis. Their tradecraft is superb, operational security second to none and the extensive usage of 'living-off-the-land' techniques enables them to easily bypass many security solutions they encounter.[4]
&gt; 
&gt; Other cybersecurity firms, Fidelis Cybersecurity and FireEye, independently reviewed the malware and came to the same conclusion as CrowdStrike—that expert Russian hacking groups were responsible for the breach.[25]

[It became a story in June](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html) and the leaks happened in the end of July. 

&gt; On July 22, 2016, the hacker calling himself ""Guccifer 2.0"" claimed he hacked and then leaked the DNC emails to website WikiLeaks.[29][30][31] The ""Guccifer 2.0"" individual claimed on his website that he is not Russian.

Don't get me wrong, you're allowed to speculate how much you want. But now you're claiming that it's more ""realistic"" that it was a whistle-blower  and says it's laughable that it was Russians (who have a long history of doing things like this both in the US and in Europe, China etc) without presenting ANY proof to back you up. 

First you talk about some emails, then you link to a Snopes news story which is from July that just got snippets from other articles of what people knew during that time, and then you link to a CNN video article which is already in the Snopes article.

You're also missing out that the hacks were first reported about in WaPo in mid-June so of course it had been talked about before that 25th of July interview you linked to earlier.

Mean the theory about Russia was unproven at the time was because Crowdstrike hadn't released their report publicly then.

Now he just says that he doesn't think the hack had the effect the nation-state wanted. Which was to sway the election so far it would lead to Clinton dropping out, instead she held on and had a solid lead during most of the election.

No he says that he doesn't think it had **the effect the foreign government had hoped it might**. Which is a big difference from what you're saying. 

The hack would under normal circumstances be the downfall of a candidate and it didn't, most people didn't care that much about them and Hillary went on and had a decent lead up until her pneumonia incident and Comey's letter.

However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.

On the other hand the Republicans, a year earlier, voted to cut funding on Embassy security around the world. That is the reason for those deaths.

Thousands of our diplomatic personnel are serving overseas in facilities that do not come close to meeting the minimal requirements for security established by the so-called Inman commission’s report on overseas diplomatic security to President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state more than two decades ago.

&gt; In the 2011 continuing resolution, Congress, at the insistence of the House of Representatives, slashed the president’s request for embassy security and construction and forced another cut in fiscal year 2012. Altogether Congress has eliminated $296 million from embassy security and construction in the last two years with additional cuts in other State Department security accounts.
&gt; 
&gt; Sequestration required under the Budget Control Act of 2011 will take more than $100 million more out of the program in 2013 if the current Congress does not overcome the impasse over budget cuts and tax revenues by yearend. Those cuts are largely the result of the draconian and unrealistically low budget caps placed by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) on all discretionary spending, falling particularly hard on the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee with responsibility for embassy security.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not the kind of treatment our dedicated government servants and men and women in uniform protecting them deserve.

&gt; But hidden beneath the GOP campaign is the fact that House Republicans voted to cut nearly $300 million from the U.S. embassy security budget. When asked if he voted to cut the funds this morning on CNN, Chaffetz said, “Absolutely”:

&gt; O’BRIEN: Is it true that you voted to cut the funding for embassy security?
&gt; 
&gt; CHAFFETZ: Absolutely. Look, we have to make priorities and choices in this country. We have — think about this — 15,000 contractors in Iraq. We have more than 6,000 contractors, private army there for President Obama in Baghdad.
&gt; 
&gt; And we’re talking about can we get two dozen or so people into Libya to help protect our forces? When you’re in tough economic times, you have to make difficult choices how to prioritize this.

The emails also got investigated and FBI reach the conclusion that Clinton's actions were ""extremely reckless"" but it wouldn't hold up in court. End of story. What should've been investigated is the use of a private server for Bush W which was set up by the RNC. His admin deleted **22 million** emails and many of them were about the Iraq war. 

Clinton used bleachbit and destroyed the devices because that's the government regulation. If anything she didn't destroy them well enough because usually they would go to recycling or be reused by someone else depending on what they contained. 

&gt; A State Department official explained in a statement to [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/actually-clinton-destroyed-phones-better/) that “department security policies mandate that all electronic devices are cleared of sensitive or classified information prior to reuse or disposal.” Some devices are wiped and reused, in other words, while others are destroyed as part of the recycling process.

86,"No matter what you believe he raises some interesting points:

&gt; Finally, there were four swing states in which Hillary Clinton was definitively favored to win, but she ended up losing: Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvnia, and Michigan. In the final tallies she lost each of them by right around one percent of the vote. That’s not how numbers work. If Trump had won those four states legitimately due to pockets of voters that pollsters didn’t know about, we would have seen a more random dispersion of the results. Trump might have won one of those states by four percent, won another of them by two percent, lost another one percent, and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; It is statistically suspicious that in every state where Donald Trump pulled off an upset, he won it by right around one percent, just what he needed to win it, no more and no less. Results don’t naturally play out that way. The final tallies in Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvnia, and Michigan read like someone went through and nudged each of them just over the mark so Trump would win them, but didn’t want to arouse too much suspicion by giving him any larger of a victory in those states than he needed.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; In order to believe that the official vote tallies are legitimate, you have to accept that all of the above legitimately happened: African-Americans in the south went from turning out in droves for Hillary Clinton in the primary to not caring if she won the general election. Donald Trump got perhaps seventy percent of the same-day voting in Florida. The polling averages were wrong for the first time in modern history. Trump beat his poll numbers despite having spent the primary season tending to fall below them. Clinton fell below her poll numbers despite having spent the primary season tending to beat them. In every state where Trump pulled off a shocking upset victory, he just happened to do it with one percent of the vote. And in an election that everyone cared particularly deeply about, no one really turned out to vote at all. I can accept any one of the above things happening as an isolated fluke. I cannot accept all the above happening.

EDIT: 

Also this from /u/cjp96's link:

&gt; “This country is violently divided. There simply aren’t enough white guys to elect Trump nor a Republican Senate.

&gt; 
&gt; According to the exit polls last Tuesday, 88% of black voters voted for Hillary Clinton, as well as  65% of hispanic and asian American voters.
&gt; 
&gt; “The list is loaded overwhelmingly with voters of colour and the poor,” says Palast. “Many didn’t discover that their vote was stolen until they turned up last Tuesday and found their name missing. In the US they are given something called a provisional ballot, but if your name is not on the voter roll, you can fill out all the provisional votes you like they’re not going to count your vote. – They can’t even if you’re wrongly removed.

The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave us the wherewithal.

94,"&gt; In addition to brokering the purchases, Fugazy helped arrange a deal that year between Trump and auto executive Lee Iacocca, one of his closest friends, to buy a condo building in Florida. In the photo below (from left) Iacocca, Fugazy and Trump are attending the 1987 wedding of their pal George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite his rich and powerful friends, Fugazy was in deep financial trouble in 1986, and declared personal bankruptcy that summer. Prosecutors later alleged that Fugazy lied in bankruptcy filings about who owned one of his companies. He struck a deal to avoid prison by pleading guilty to perjury. President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 2001, just hours before leaving office.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever Fugazy’s motive, it would have been difficult for anyone to make a solid case that Trump deserved an award for “helping America’s inner cities,” in 1986.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time, Trump and his father held the dubious honor of having been the defendants in one of the largest-ever housing discrimination lawsuits, a case sparked by a Justice Department civil rights investigation that found the Trumps discriminated against prospective tenants who were black.
&gt; 
&gt; The discrimination case was settled with an extensive consent decree. But by the mid-1980s Trump was back in court, this time trying to force poor and elderly tenants from their rent-controlled apartments in one of his buildings. In addition to the lawsuit, Trump shut off the water in the building and refused to make repairs.
&gt; 
&gt; As Trump’s longtime special counsel, Cohen has been deeply involved in the GOP nominee’s largely unsuccessful effort to win support from black and Latino voters, primarily as the founder and co-chair of Trump’s minority outreach group, The National Diversity Coalition for Trump. Earlier this year, Cohen arranged for Trump to meet with black religious leaders in New York and then in Detroit, helping secure a small number of high-profile endorsements.

About the donation of an office to mr Jackson. Good for Trump but that doesn't make him any less racist just because he did one good deed. It doesn't take away that he's ben discriminating against black people, Latinos, Muslims and other immigrants. It doesn't take away that he said that black people are born with a trait of laziness. 

It doesn't take away that he violated the civil rights act by refusing to rent homes to black people, ordered blacks to leave casino floor whenever him or wife arrives on property,  built a casino in black majority city and breaks promise to mayor about hiring locals, refrains to hire the minorities and opting to staff the casino with almost exclusively all Caucasian employees, refused to disavow support from the Klu Klux Klan multiple times during interview only to change his mind later on twitter, retweets message from Pro-Hitler, white genocide conspiracy Twitter account, picks famed white supremacist leader as delegate, picks an entire administration who have a history of racism and discrimination,  gives press credentials to white supremacist radio host,  discriminated against Native-Americans as well and much much more.

95,"Sigh, Trump supporters have tried all year to use that Robert Byrd KKK connection to their advantage and it fails every time. [Byrd denounced the KKK in the 60s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd#Ku_Klux_Klan)!

&gt; 1952, he announced ""After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan."" He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was anti-communist.[13]
&gt; 
&gt; In 1997, Byrd told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also warned, ""Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that albatross around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena.""[22] In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he ""was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision — a jejune and immature outlook — seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions.""[23] Byrd also said, in 2005, ""I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times ... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened.""[13]

[Even the NAACP wrote this about him when he died:](http://www.snopes.com/clinton-byrd-photo-klan/)

&gt; The NAACP is saddened by the passing of United States Senator Robert Byrd. Byrd, the longest serving member of congress was first elected to the U.S. House from [West Virginia] in 1952 and was elected Senator in 1958. Byrd passed away this morning at the age of 92.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Senator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,"" stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. ""Senator Byrd went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Senator Byrd came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda, doing well on the NAACP Annual Civil Rights Report Card. He stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the historic health care legislation of 2010 and his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention legislation,"" stated Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy. ""Senator Byrd was a master of the Senate Rules, and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of Americans. He will be sorely missed.""

[About the Ellis Island Medal of Honor](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-naacp_us_580ac881e4b000d0b156e6e2), it's a bullshit award founded by William Fugazy, in spite of a real award called Medals of Liberty. William Fugazy later pleaded guilty to perjury. In the photo they are even standing next to anti-gay activist Anita Bryant. The founder couldn't handle that the real award Medals of Liberty went to immigrants in NY so he made his own award.

The only reason Trump got the award was most likely because he was a friend and business associate with the founder. It was certainly not because of his open mind towards black people.

&gt;Trump was one of [80 individuals to receive the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 1986](http://www.snopes.com/trump-received-ellis-island-award-in-1986/), the first year that the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations handed out the award. However, the fact that Donald Trump received the award and posed for a photograph says little about his motivations or whether or not he has racist tendencies, only that he received an award and participated in a ceremony meant to honor him (and others). 

&gt; A photograph of Donald Trump, Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks that the founder of Trump’s “diversity coalition” hailed as evidence the Republican nominee won an “NAACP medal” for “helping America’s inner cities” was actually taken at an awards ceremony organized by a business associate with an ethnic grievance.
&gt; 
&gt; William Fugazy, a politically well-connected businessman who later pleaded guilty to perjury, gave the awards to Trump and 79 other people, most of them white, to protest the awarding of “medals of liberty” to a group of 12 recent immigrants that included a Chinese-born architect, a Costa Rica-born astronaut, a leading expert on the psychology of race, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, but no “Irish, Italian, or Polish” people.
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, adviser and campaign surrogate, posted the photo on Twitter earlier this week of Trump, Parks and Ali, “receiving NAACP medals for helping America’s inner cities. A man for ALL people!”
&gt; 
&gt; The NAACP has not awarded any medals to Trump for “helping America’s inner cities,” the group told HuffPost. Nor have any other civil rights groups, according to Trump’s biographers.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s the real story. In 1986, as preparations began for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, a civic committee selected a group of 12 naturalized citizens to receive “medals of liberty” from President Ronald Reagan. The final list, announced that March, included composer Irving Berlin, who emigrated from Russia; Franklin Chang Diaz, an astronaut from Costa Rica; I.M. Pei, an architect born in China; and entertainment legend Bob Hope, who was born in England.
&gt; 
&gt; There was an immediate outcry. Fugazy, then Trump’s real estate broker and head of the Coalition of Italo-American Associations, was angry that there were no native-born citizens among the 12 liberty medal winners (which was inevitable, since the award was for naturalized citizens) and that the list excluded certain ethnicities, “like the Irish, Italians and Poles.”
&gt; 
&gt; Fugazy’s Coalition of Italo-American Associations helped lead the campaign against the selections. “We think it’s an insult to ― on the one hand ― ask for donations to restore the foremost international symbol of freedom for immigrants and ― on the other hand ― to exclude most of them from the Medal of Liberty list,” Joseph Martorana, the group’s executive director, told the Miami Herald, before claiming that “the ethnic groups excluded account for 76 percent of the nation’s population.”
&gt; 
&gt; Fugazy had plenty of support. New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, called the selections “idiotic” and announced plans to hand out his own awards.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s almost like denying some of the building blocks of the nation. It’s an historical betrayal,” New York City Council majority leader Peter Vallone told the Herald.
&gt; 
&gt; Six of the 12 recipients of the medals, including Berlin, Kissinger, violinist Itzhak Perlman, polio vaccine inventor Albert Sabin, author Elie Wiesel and University of Chicago president Hanna Holborn Gray, were of Jewish descent.
&gt; 
&gt; ”These are shameful concessions to a Hollywood producer who lives in the world of fantasy,” Paul O’Dwyer, a former New York City Council president, told the Herald, presumably referring to “Roots” producer David Wolper, also Jewish, who had organized the centennial festivities. “I don’t know what some of these people have done for history ― although Kissinger and Bob Hope have certainly done well for themselves,” he added. “All in all, it shows an abysmal ignorance of the history of our country.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some people tried to defend the awards. “The great wave of Irish and Italian immigration took place before the First World War. It is therefore hardly surprising that most Irish Americans and Italian Americans are Americans by birth, not naturalization,” historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a member of the committee that selected the 12 winners, noted in a letter to The New York Times.
&gt; 
&gt; But Schlesinger’s letter didn’t put the matter to rest. That the committee had included Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was of Irish descent, as well as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, both of Italian descent, didn’t seem to absolve the committee, either.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, the controversy continued into the summer. That June, Fugazy created a new organization, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, or NECO, and a new award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump, Ali and Parks were among 80 people honored at NECO’s first awards ceremony on Ellis Island on Oct. 27, 1986. Only four of the 80 winners were black.
&gt; 
&gt; In the original, uncropped version of the photo that Cohen shared, there are six people: baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, humorist Victor Borge, singer and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant, Ali, Parks and Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; Since 1986, more than 2,000 people have been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including then-first lady Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Officially, the medal criteria are broad and inclusive: Winners should “uphold the ideals and spirit of America,” while “maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage.”
&gt; 
&gt; In practice, the winners are mostly white Americans of European descent. NECO maintains a database of past medal honorees, which in many cases cites their “ethnic heritage.” Below is McCain’s listing, which notes his heritage is “Scottish/Irish.”
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not clear precisely why Fugazy selected Trump to receive the medal in its inaugural year, save for their friendship and Trump’s success in business. Fugazy died in 2015. Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about the award or about Cohen’s tweet.
&gt; But Fugazy was working as a broker for Trump in 1986, helping him to purchase two new properties, a 1987 government ethics report revealed. Trump ultimately paid Fugazy more than $500,000 in fees.

&gt; [BANNON HAS EMBRACED THE ALT RIGHT, A LOOSE NETWORK OF WHITE NATIONALISTS AND ANTI-SEMITES](http://www.adl.org/sp/stephen-bannon-backgrounder/bannon-backgrounder.html).
&gt; 
&gt; The alt right is a loose network of individuals and groups that promote white identity and reject mainstream conservatism in favor of politics that embrace implicit or explicit racism, anti-Semitism and white supremacy. Often by leveraging social media and the Internet, alt right adherents express opposition to multiculturalism, immigration and often claim that there is a Jewish conspiracy to advocate for “white genocide.”  Bannon “proudly” told a reporter at the 2016 Republican National Convention “we’re the platform for the alt right.” In the same interview in Mother Jones magazine, he denied that the alt right is inherently racist or anti-Semitic, although a vast majority of people affiliated with that movement hold racist and anti-Semitic views. 

&gt; In addition, under Bannon, Breitbart News published an article co-authored by Milo Yiannopoulos, a figure who is associated with the alt right, that played down the racism of some of the alt right’s main ideologues.  In The Daily Beast in August 2016, alt right figure Richard Spencer, said: 

&gt;“Breitbart has elective affinities with the alt-right and the alt-right has clearly influenced Breitbart. In this way, Breitbart has acted as a ‘gateway’ to alt-right ideas and writers.” Bannon has also been embraced by white supremacists for his views in recent days. Numerous well-known white supremacists weighed in on President-elect Trump’s appointment of Bannon as his chief strategist. David Duke called the selection of Bannon “excellent,” adding that Bannon was “basically creating the ideological aspects of where we’re going.” Peter Brimelow, who runs the racist site VDare, said that the Bannon hire was “amazing.”  Jared Taylor of American Renaissance and Brad Griffin who runs the Occidental Dissent website both said that Bannon would help hold Trump to his campaign rhetoric on immigration and other issues.  Rocky Suhayda of the American Nazi Party voiced the same view.  

In addition, Bannon has reportedly reached out to far-right figure and French political activist Marine Le Pen. She tweeted that he had invited her to work together with the new Trump administration.

&gt; While there is a long fact pattern of evidence that Breitbart served as a platform for a wide range of bigotry and there is some controversy related to statements from Mr. Bannon’s divorce proceedings in 2007, we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements made by Bannon himself.  In fact, Jewish employees of Breitbart have challenged the characterization of him and defended him from charges of anti-Semitism. Some have pointed out that Breitbart Jerusalem was launched during his tenure. 
&gt; 
&gt; UNDER BANNON, BREITBART NEWS PUBLISHED INFLAMMATORY PIECES ABOUT WOMEN, MUSLIMS AND OTHER GROUPS.
&gt; 
&gt; Bannon has been on leave from Breitbart since August 2016, when he took over as CEO of the Trump campaign. In his absence, the right-wing “news” site has continued to publish a stream of inflammatory, creatively-sourced “stories.” Many of the Breitbart headlines published under Bannon’s tenure illustrate the website’s virulently anti-Muslim, misogynistic, worldview, including: “Planned Parenthood’s Body Count Under Cecile Richards is Up to Half a Holocaust,” “Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?” and “Political Correctness Protects Muslim Rape Culture.” As Bannon’s defenders have pointed out, these headlines are designed to attract attention and readers, and are not necessarily evidence that Bannon himself is an anti-Semite, a misogynist or an anti-Muslim bigot.
&gt; 
&gt; However, under Bannon, Breitbart News has provided a platform for anti-Muslim extremists such as Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer and others to advocate their agendas. More recently, the website published a number of articles attacking the family of Capt. Humayun Khan, who died while serving in Iraq, and accusing his father Khizr Khan of having “deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia—and to international Islamist investors.” Advocating for the Muslim immigration ban, which president-elect Trump suggested during his presidential campaign, the website called it an “‘Extraordinary, Brilliant’ Move” and published articles defending its constitutionality.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, Bannon essentially has established himself as the chief curator for the alt right. Under his stewardship, Breitbart has emerged as the leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and promote hate.

So does it matter that he specifically haven't said anything publicy about Jews? His ex-wife said he didn't like Jews in court and he has embraced the ""alt-right"" and the embrace of anti-Semites from all over the globe and employs them.

His biographer said:

&gt; Trump’s father instilled in him the idea that their family’s success was genetic, according to Trump biographer Michael D’Antonio.
&gt; 
&gt; “The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,” D’Antonio says in the documentary. “They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.”

145,"&gt; A claim of emergency powers was at the center of President Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus without Congressional approval in 1861.  Lincoln claimed that the rebellion created an emergency that permitted him the extraordinary power of unilaterally suspending the writ. With Chief Justice Roger Taney sitting as judge, the Federal District Court of Maryland struck down the suspension in Ex Parte Merryman, although Lincoln ignored the order.  17 F. Cas. 144 (1861).
&gt; 
&gt; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt similarly invoked emergency powers when he issued Executive Order 9066 directing that all Japanese Americans residing on the West Coast be placed into internment camps during World War II.  Because Congress had already declared war, the U.S. Supreme Court found Congress to have recognized an ongoing emergency.  Consequently, the President by issuing the order had acted in accordance with Congress's expressed intent, which was to respond to the emergency of war.  For this reason, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Executive Order 9066 in Korematsu v. United States as a constitutional exercise of Presidential Commander in Chief and emergency powers.  323 U.S. 214 (1944). 
&gt; 
&gt; Harry Truman declared the use of emergency powers when he seized private steel mills that failed to produce steel because of a labor strike in 1952.  With the Korean War ongoing, Truman asserted that he could not wage war successfully if the economy failed to provide him with the material resources necessary to keep the troops well-equipped.  The U.S. Supreme Court, however, refused to buy the argument in Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, voting 6-3 that neither Commander in Chief powers nor any claimed emergency powers gave the President the authority to unilaterally seize private property without Congressional legislation.  343 U.S. 579.

If anyone is worried, this bullshit lie from Trump is not going unheard in the rest of the world. 

This is from the biggest newspaper in Sweden [Dagens Nyheter](http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/donald-trump-tar-at-sig-aran-for-fordbeslut/):

&gt; First page headline: **Car Plant ""rescued"" from relocation by Trump**
&gt; 
&gt; Article headline: **Donald Trump takes credit for Ford-decision**
&gt; 
&gt; US president-elect Donald Trump has stated on Twitter that he worked hard to get Ford Motor Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to preserve a car plant in Kentucky. According to Ford Motor there has never been an issue to close the factory.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It was probably not even a possibility to close the factory, in the light of the guarantees the automaker has given to the employees of the United Auto Workers union that runs the 2019.
&gt; 
&gt; It is about a factory with 4700 employees in Louisville, Kentucky, which produces SUV's with brands Lincoln and Ford Escape.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford is questioned. Last year, he claimed that he persuaded Ford to move jobs from Mexico to the US state of Ohio when the decision was in fact made in 2011 - several years before Trump announced his presidential campaign.",2016-11-18 08:56:33+00:00,da5g79g,2.0,t1_da59exe,16078.0,politics

155,"Oh yeah now I remember, thanks! 

&gt;In his latest video posted on GQ, Keith Olbermann demonstrated the links between Trump’s presidential campaign and the so-called right-wing conspiracy that tried — and failed — to bring down Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1990s.

&gt;“While certainly they want to defeat Hillary, relitigating the Bill Clinton legacy for the 4,000th time and beating her up and beating him up is almost as satisfying,” Olbermann said.

&gt;Olbermann recalled conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, who he was dating at the time, explaining what he needed to know in 1998 about the “vast right-wing conspiracy” working to bring down President Bill Clinton.

&gt;Ingraham showed him a fax machine, where rumors and allegations were disseminated and then injected into the media conversation by Matt Drudge.

&gt;She explained there were only about a dozen conspirators involved, including pollster and opposition researcher Kellyanne Fitzpatrick and disgraced political investigator David Bossie.

&gt;Fitzpatrick went on to marry attorney George Conway, who had represented Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton, and Bossie became the director of the conservative Citizens United activist group.

&gt;They now serve as Trump’s campaign manager and deputy campaign manager — and Olbermann suspects the real estate developer and former reality TV star might be something of a victim in their ongoing efforts to destroy the Clintons.

&gt;“There are two things to understand,” Olbermann said. “When Hillary Clinton said there was a vast right-wing conspiracy to undermine her husband, she was wrong. It wasn’t vast, but it sure had stamina, even as its public faces like Newt Gingrich committed career suicide trying to lay the Clintons low. It stayed alive, often underground, until the opportunity arose for a comeback — you know, like Dracula.”

&gt;“That’s the second thing to understand,” Olbermann continued. “That opportunity was Donald Trump. He probably doesn’t even realize it, but now you do, and in this part of this nightmare journey Trump is actually something of a victim. Sure, Ingram and Conway and Bossie and Drudge and the others would like to see him elected, but if he crashes and burns and ruins his businesses and has to leave the country in disgrace and goes into the history books as the man who tried to replace the government of the United States with a dictatorship with a bad combover — hey, at least they scuffed Hillary up again. And a President Hillary means they can get the band back together and spend the next four years conspiring against her. They got what they wanted.”

Seriously, fuck the people. 

&gt;They waged war against the Clintons in the '90s, founding what Hillary Clinton would famously describe as the 'vast right wing conspiracy' working to discredit her husband. 

&gt;Clinton revived the term in her 2016 campaign, saying the same actors were out to get her family now - they're just better funded than they were when her husband held the White House and operating in the open.

&gt;Along with Conway, Bossie, and The Drudge Report's Matt Drudge, Ingraham helped publicize allegations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton, Ingraham's ex-boyfriend, Keith Olbermann, the liberal commentator told GQ in October.

&gt; Her (Ingraham) first book, published in 2000, The Hillary Trap: Looking for Power in All the Wrong Places, took aim at the former first lady for pushing a form of feminism that 'rewards dependency' and 'celebrates victimhood.'

159,"&gt;In a testy exchange with Yahoo News during the Republican Convention in Cleveland in July, Flynn acknowledged that he was paid through his speakers bureau to attend the RT event, but he declined to say how much.

&gt;What was striking, according to ethics experts, is that given his overseas consulting business, Flynn began sitting in on classified intelligence briefings with Trump last summer. Flynn was reportedly so assertive during the initial briefing in August, peppering the briefers with rapid-fire questions, that Trump’s adviser Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who also attended the briefing, was prompted to try to calm him down by placing a hand on his arm. 

&gt;Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, an outside watchdog group, said that she finds it “deeply disturbing” that Flynn attended these briefings at a time that he was representing foreign clients with interests before the U.S. government. “It’s exactly the kind of foreign entanglements our laws are designed to prevent,” she said.

&gt;One retired military officer who has advised both Republican and Democratic presidents said of the allegations about Flynn: “If this is true, it’s a disqualifying conflict of interest — if not by ethics laws, certainly in the spirit of conflict of interest, not to mention security regulations. We should be deeply concerned about his ethical judgment, but more specifically how can he possibly provide unbiased advice to the POTUS about Turkey and Russia, when he’s taken money from both.”

There's too many things that are deeply disturbing about Flynn for him to be a so close to the future president. Even Christie seemed to know that he should shut up during the briefings.

182,"&gt; “They accused me of spreading false information and hatred, and demanded an apology,” Huckabee told The Forward, a Jewish-American publication. “And they’re right, I do owe readers an apology.”

Did he post the apology to his facebook too? Otherwise his ignorant followers won't get the message. 

EDIT: 

Found his ""[Apology](https://www.facebook.com/mikehuckabee/)"":
&gt; 
&gt; The New York Daily News attacked me for linking to a story from Conservative Tribune about two students who were arrested for defacing the chapel at Northwestern University with racist, anti-gay, and anti-Semitic graffiti and the word, “Trump.” They accused me of spreading false information and hatred, and demanded an apology. And they’re right, I do owe readers an apology. Due to a posting error, the story was actually from last March, but it appeared to be a new story. I didn’t remember the original story and assumed it was new. For that mistake, I sincerely apologize. But the facts of the story were otherwise accurate.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the rest of the paper’s attacks on me, which included a disputed report that the vandals were Jewish, that was part of the original story and was certainly not intended as any sort of slur on Jews. It was considered relevant only because the hateful graffiti included a swastika, obviously intended to make it falsely appear that the vandalism was committed by anti-Jewish Trump supporters.
&gt; 
&gt; The Daily News writer went on to attack on me for defending Trump supporters from charges of widespread hate crimes, insinuating that there is a wave of hate crimes in America, all aimed in one direction: right against left. For the record: I would never defend anyone who is legitimately accused of a hate crime. There is no excuse for anyone to attack someone else because of who they are or what they believe. I have been a lifelong advocate for freedom of speech for all views, in the face of an ever-growing PC movement that would seek to gut the First Amendment and pre-censor people’s beliefs even to the point of depriving them of their livelihoods simply for holding certain religious beliefs.
&gt; 
&gt; But as we learned from Project Veritas, there has been a concerted effort over the past year to slander and demonize Trump supporters, even to the point of inciting violence at Trump rallies to blame it on Trump supporters. We know now that the much-ridiculed “hidden Trump vote” was real, because Trump supporters were intimidated into keeping their political views silent due to fears of intolerant leftists who were vandalizing cars, stealing yards signs and threatening them personally, all across the country. In the wake of that, I think it’s wise to maintain a little skepticism about reports of fire-breathing, violent Trump supporters. And if you want an example of a hate crime, how about this story from Rockville, Maryland, involving a 15-year-old boy in a “Make America Great Again” cap who was brutally beaten by anti-Trump protesters?
&gt; It’s not clear if any words were exchanged before the attack, but that’s the point. If you truly believe in non-violence and that “love trumps hate,” then it shouldn’t matter what words were exchanged. Nobody on either side of a political issue should ever respond to words with violence.

183,"&gt; Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department’s civil rights division was rebuilt into what former Atty. Gen. Eric Holder called the agency’s’ “crown jewel.”
&gt; 
&gt; But many civil rights advocates and legal scholars are worried the unit faces an uncertain future under a Trump administration and, at a minimum, a dramatically different focus.
&gt; 
&gt; They predict the Justice Department in the coming years will be less likely to sue states over voting restrictions that target the poor or minorities, to hold police departments accountable for abuses or fight in court for the rights of transgender people.
&gt; 
&gt; Also vulnerable are Justice Department guidelines set under President Obama that sought more lenient sentences for nonviolent offenders and restricted racial profiling and surveillance of Muslims.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a radical shift of priorities would come as the country continues to grapple with the aftermath of widespread unrest and frustration sparked by the killings of unarmed black men by police officers in cities and towns across the nation. 
&gt;
&gt; “We are very concerned that simple inactivity by the Department of Justice will help undo the progress made over the last eight years,” said Michael W. Macleod-Ball, attorney at the ACLU in Washington. “It’s not a good time to unwind efforts intended to make life fairer for vulnerable populations.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Civil rights groups are particularly anxious that such changes might follow an election in which Trump’s candidacy was enthusiastically backed by the alt-right movement, white supremacists and hate groups with long histories of seeking to repress minorities.
&gt; 
&gt; “There are many in the civil rights community who are prepared to stand opposed to anyone who would turn back the clock,” said  Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.  “These are among the most important issues in our country now.”

&gt; Much will depend on whom Trump taps to lead an agency that has more than 100,000 employees and a $28.7-billion annual budget.
&gt; 
&gt; Among those on Trump’s shortlist for attorney general, according to Republican sources, are Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who has led investigations into the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya; Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a rival during the primaries; and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
&gt; 
&gt; All three are known for their conservative credentials and are considered to hold views similar to those who ran the Justice Department during the most recent Bush administration, when civil rights enforcement was often overshadowed by other issues, such as combating terrorism.

186,"&gt; The United States on Wednesday announced an ambitious new goal to rapidly reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury, despite the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, a man who has called the phenomenon a “hoax” invented by the Chinese.
&gt; 
&gt; Secretary of State John Kerry said at a news conference in Marrakech, Morocco, that he couldn’t “speculate about what policies our president-elect will pursue.” But he noted that “some issues look a little bit different when you’re actually in office compared to when you’re on the campaign trail,” adding that climate change should cease being a partisan issue.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s abundantly clear we have the ability to prevent the worst impacts of climate change,” Kerry said during the United Nation’s annual climate summit. “But again we’re forced to ask: Do we have the collective will? Because our success is not going to happen by accident.”
&gt; 
&gt; Under the newly released strategy, which aims to rapidly “decarbonize” America, emissions would be slashed about 80 percent by 2050, compared with levels set in 2005. The U.S. has already promised a 26 percent to 28 percent cut in emissions by 2025 and would build on those pledges through a transition to renewable energy production, carbon removal technology and efforts to curb emissions from agriculture and other sources.",2016-11-17 19:25:17+00:00,da4ld00,1.0,t3_5dhq0v,190.0,politics

226,"&gt; The leader of the National Security Agency says there shouldn't be ""any doubt in anybody's mind"" that there was a conscious effort by a nation-state to sway the result of the 2016 presidential election.
&gt; 
&gt; Adm. Michael Rogers, who leads both the NSA and US Cyber Command, made the comments in response to a question about Wikileaks' release of nearly 20,000 internal DNC emails during a conference presented by The Wall Street Journal.
&gt; 
&gt; **“There shouldn’t be any doubt in anybody’s minds,"" Rogers said. ""This was not something that was done casually. This was not something that was done by chance. This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily. This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Rogers did not specify the nation-state or the specific effect, though US intelligence officials suspect Russia provided the emails to Wikileaks, after hackers stole them from inside DNC servers and the personal email account of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta.
&gt; 
&gt; At least two different hacker groups associated with the Russian government were found inside the networks of the DNC over the past year, reading emails, chats, and downloading private documents. Many of those files were later released by Wikileaks.
&gt; 
&gt; The hack, which was investigated by the FBI and cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, was linked to Russia through a lengthy technical analysis, which was detailed on the firm's blog. Former NSA research scientist Dave Aitel, who now leads a cybersecurity firm, called the analysis ""pretty dead on.""
&gt; 
&gt; The hack of Podesta's private Gmail address was traced back by cybersecurity researchers to hackers with Russia's foreign intelligence service, the GRU, since the group made a critical error during its campaign of ""spear phishing"" targets, tricking them into clicking on malicious links or give up their passwords. The firm, Dell SecureWorks, found the group had targeted more than 100 email addresses that were associated with the Clinton campaign, according to The New York Times.
&gt; 
&gt; The Obama administration publicly accused Russia of being behind the hacks in October.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The US intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails,"" read a statement from the Department of Homeland Security. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.""

256,"[WRONG!](http://i.giphy.com/3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu.gif)

They didn't have a meeting in exchange for $1 million. You have either misinterpreted the original email, listened to Pence and Fox News or you're just lying. Here's what the email said and [what they wanted out of the meeting](http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/did-qatar-promise-clinton-foundation-1-million-fiv/):

&gt; Amitabh Desai, the Clinton Foundation’s foreign policy director, emailed three Clinton Foundation employees and Doug Band, Bill Clinton’s personal aide on April 16, 2012, about his meetings with ambassadors from Qatar and a few other foreign countries. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.

&gt; &gt;""Qatar — Would like to see WJC (William Jefferson Clinton) for ‘five minutes’ in NYC, to present $1 million check that Qatar promises from WJC’s birthday in 2011,"" Desai wrote. **""Qatar would welcome our suggestions for investments in Haiti — particularly on education and health**. They have allocated most of their $20 million but are happy to consider projects we suggest. I'm collecting input from CF Haiti team.""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So the government of Qatar was going to give the Clinton Foundation $1 million as part of a five-minute meeting, according to this email.
&gt; 
&gt; But Pence could have been more accurate in his description.
&gt; 
&gt; Pence said Qatar ""was going to"" make a $1 million donation in exchange for a five-minute meeting. But according to Desai’s email, Qatar had promised the check for Bill Clinton’s birthday the previous year. The meeting was to present the check.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, it’s not clear if the Qatari ambassador ever got his ""five minutes"" with the former president.

257,"Nope, still no evidence of it going into his own pockets. It went to the Clinton Foundation for charity work and it wasn't the first time they had donated to to them.

267,"Because it's an almost made up award done in spite of ""Medals of Liberty"". The only reason Trump got the award was most likely because he was a friend and business associate with the founder. It was certainly not because of his open mind towards black people.

&gt;[ A photograph of Donald Trump, Muhammad Ali and Rosa Parks that the founder of Trump’s “diversity coalition”](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-naacp_us_580ac881e4b000d0b156e6e2) hailed as evidence the Republican nominee won an “NAACP medal” for “helping America’s inner cities” was actually taken at an awards ceremony organized by a business associate with an ethnic grievance.
&gt; 
&gt; William Fugazy, a politically well-connected businessman who later pleaded guilty to perjury, gave the awards to Trump and 79 other people, most of them white, to protest the awarding of “medals of liberty” to a group of 12 recent immigrants that included a Chinese-born architect, a Costa Rica-born astronaut, a leading expert on the psychology of race, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, but no “Irish, Italian, or Polish” people.
&gt; 
&gt; Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime attorney, adviser and campaign surrogate, posted the photo on Twitter earlier this week of Trump, Parks and Ali, “receiving NAACP medals for helping America’s inner cities. A man for ALL people!”
&gt; 
&gt; The NAACP has not awarded any medals to Trump for “helping America’s inner cities,” the group told HuffPost. Nor have any other civil rights groups, according to Trump’s biographers.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s the real story. In 1986, as preparations began for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty, a civic committee selected a group of 12 naturalized citizens to receive “medals of liberty” from President Ronald Reagan. The final list, announced that March, included composer Irving Berlin, who emigrated from Russia; Franklin Chang Diaz, an astronaut from Costa Rica; I.M. Pei, an architect born in China; and entertainment legend Bob Hope, who was born in England.
&gt; 
&gt; There was an immediate outcry. Fugazy, then Trump’s real estate broker and head of the Coalition of Italo-American Associations, was angry that there were no native-born citizens among the 12 liberty medal winners (which was inevitable, since the award was for naturalized citizens) and that the list excluded certain ethnicities, “like the Irish, Italians and Poles.”
&gt; 
&gt; Fugazy’s Coalition of Italo-American Associations helped lead the campaign against the selections. “We think it’s an insult to ― on the one hand ― ask for donations to restore the foremost international symbol of freedom for immigrants and ― on the other hand ― to exclude most of them from the Medal of Liberty list,” Joseph Martorana, the group’s executive director, told the Miami Herald, before claiming that “the ethnic groups excluded account for 76 percent of the nation’s population.”
&gt; 
&gt; Fugazy had plenty of support. New York Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, called the selections “idiotic” and announced plans to hand out his own awards.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s almost like denying some of the building blocks of the nation. It’s an historical betrayal,” New York City Council majority leader Peter Vallone told the Herald.
&gt; 
&gt; Six of the 12 recipients of the medals, including Berlin, Kissinger, violinist Itzhak Perlman, polio vaccine inventor Albert Sabin, author Elie Wiesel and University of Chicago president Hanna Holborn Gray, were of Jewish descent.
&gt; 
&gt; ”These are shameful concessions to a Hollywood producer who lives in the world of fantasy,” Paul O’Dwyer, a former New York City Council president, told the Herald, presumably referring to “Roots” producer David Wolper, also Jewish, who had organized the centennial festivities. “I don’t know what some of these people have done for history ― although Kissinger and Bob Hope have certainly done well for themselves,” he added. “All in all, it shows an abysmal ignorance of the history of our country.”
&gt; 
&gt; Some people tried to defend the awards. “The great wave of Irish and Italian immigration took place before the First World War. It is therefore hardly surprising that most Irish Americans and Italian Americans are Americans by birth, not naturalization,” historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a member of the committee that selected the 12 winners, noted in a letter to The New York Times.
&gt; 
&gt; But Schlesinger’s letter didn’t put the matter to rest. That the committee had included Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who was of Irish descent, as well as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, both of Italian descent, didn’t seem to absolve the committee, either.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead, the controversy continued into the summer. That June, Fugazy created a new organization, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, or NECO, and a new award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump, Ali and Parks were among 80 people honored at NECO’s first awards ceremony on Ellis Island on Oct. 27, 1986. Only four of the 80 winners were black.
&gt; 
&gt; In the original, uncropped version of the photo that Cohen shared, there are six people: baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, humorist Victor Borge, singer and anti-gay activist Anita Bryant, Ali, Parks and Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; Since 1986, more than 2,000 people have been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including then-first lady Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Officially, the medal criteria are broad and inclusive: Winners should “uphold the ideals and spirit of America,” while “maintaining the traditions of their ethnic heritage.”
&gt; 
&gt; In practice, the winners are mostly white Americans of European descent. NECO maintains a database of past medal honorees, which in many cases cites their “ethnic heritage.” Below is McCain’s listing, which notes his heritage is “Scottish/Irish.” 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not clear precisely why Fugazy selected Trump to receive the medal in its inaugural year, save for their friendship and Trump’s success in business. Fugazy died in 2015. Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about the award or about Cohen’s tweet.
&gt; 
&gt; But Fugazy was working as a broker for Trump in 1986, helping him to purchase two new properties, a 1987 government ethics report revealed. Trump ultimately paid Fugazy more than $500,000 in fees.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to brokering the purchases, Fugazy helped arrange a deal that year between Trump and auto executive Lee Iacocca, one of his closest friends, to buy a condo building in Florida. In the photo below (from left) Iacocca, Fugazy and Trump are attending the 1987 wedding of their pal George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite his rich and powerful friends, Fugazy was in deep financial trouble in 1986, and declared personal bankruptcy that summer. Prosecutors later alleged that Fugazy lied in bankruptcy filings about who owned one of his companies. He struck a deal to avoid prison by pleading guilty to perjury. President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 2001, just hours before leaving office.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever Fugazy’s motive, it would have been difficult for anyone to make a solid case that Trump deserved an award for “helping America’s inner cities,” in 1986.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time, Trump and his father held the dubious honor of having been the defendants in one of the largest-ever housing discrimination lawsuits, a case sparked by a Justice Department civil rights investigation that found the Trumps discriminated against prospective tenants who were black.
&gt; 
&gt; The discrimination case was settled with an extensive consent decree. But by the mid-1980s Trump was back in court, this time trying to force poor and elderly tenants from their rent-controlled apartments in one of his buildings. In addition to the lawsuit, Trump shut off the water in the building and refused to make repairs.
&gt; 
&gt; As Trump’s longtime special counsel, Cohen has been deeply involved in the GOP nominee’s largely unsuccessful effort to win support from black and Latino voters, primarily as the founder and co-chair of Trump’s minority outreach group, The National Diversity Coalition for Trump. Earlier this year, Cohen arranged for Trump to meet with black religious leaders in New York and then in Detroit, helping secure a small number of high-profile endorsements. And he frequently defends Trump against critics who point to Trump’s long history of racist statements as proof that he is indeed racist.

293,"Well first you got to understand that this has been a talking point which Russia use against countries who are close to joining NATO for several years back. They use it as an excuse to say that they feel threatened if that particular country joins NATO because ""it will lead to WWIII"".

Trumpers have since picked this up from fringe right-wing media such as Breitbart/Infowars and they've also started to use a certain video from a hearing where a US general says that a no-fly zone will end in a war in Syria against Russians if the US would control the airspace. 

But for some reason Trump supporters always link to the first part of the video which doesn't show that the general actually misunderstands the question and changes his mind when John McCain interrupts him and clarifies the question. When the general understands the question he says that a no fly zone would not lead to war. 

They'd also like to say that Clinton is for a no-fly zone, which in their minds = war. But they fail to see that this is not the way a no-fly zone would be handled. 

Clinton's approach was that she was certain she could negotiate and make a deal with the Russians on a joint no-fly zone or a ""safe zone"" as she also called it so refugees would be safe from Russian and Syrian bombs (because earlier Russia and Syria had been bombing hospitals, UN aid convoys, the families of rebels and US backed rebel groups instead of only striking ISIS).

&gt; Bannon himself has described his website as the champion of the alt-right. Here's how his own website describes the alt-right:
&gt; https://archive.is/hZkG0

&gt; Natural conservatives can broadly be described as the group that the intellectuals above were writing for. They are mostly white, mostly male middle-American radicals, who are unapologetically embracing a new identity politics that prioritises the interests of their own demographic.

&gt; ...

&gt; The conservative instinct, as described by Haidt, includes a preference for homogeneity over diversity, for stability over change, and for hierarchy and order over radical egalitarianism. Their instinctive wariness of the foreign and the unfamiliar is an instinct that we all share – an evolutionary safeguard against excessive, potentially perilous curiosity – but natural conservatives feel it with more intensity. They instinctively prefer familiar societies, familiar norms, and familiar institutions.

&gt; ...

&gt; The really interesting members of the alt-right though, and the most numerous, are the natural conservatives.
&gt; In short, he champions a movement that explicitly rejects the virtues of diversity and argues in favor of white nationalism. Whether or not it is a white supremacist movement depends on your definition of white supremacist. It's generally not about lynching black people, so there's that. However, white nationalism can be accurately described as a sort of neo-white supremacy movement.

&gt; Hardcore white supremacists eventually realized that their views became unacceptable to an overwhelming majority of Americans, so they changed things up. They replaced their message of ""fuck black people they're the worst"" with ""we want to fight for white culture"". Using that framing they slowly built up their membership, and now they have a champion in the Oval Office.
&gt; White supremacy may not be a fair description since they don't ever make that argument explicitly, but it undoubtedly grew from white supremacist movements.

&gt; Breitbart has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and it served as a clearinghouse for attacks on Mr. Trump’s adversaries, spreading unsubstantiated rumors about Hillary Clinton’s health and undermining its own reporter, Michelle Fields, after she accused Corey Lewandowski, then Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, of assaulting her.

EDIT: 

Here's another example of Russian propaganda techniques in regards to protests where they tried to blame the US embassy for inciting a protest against Putin, by [pro-Kremlin REN-TV](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-tv-lambasted-photoshopping-us-envoy-151612240.html?ref=gs).

[Faked photo of US ambassador Tefft close to the protest](http://i.imgur.com/SQJphXC.jpg)

&gt; The US embassy in Moscow on Monday ridiculed a Russian television channel after it posted a picture of the ambassador crudely photoshopped into an opposition rally.
&gt; 
&gt; The Ren TV channel claimed in headlines that US Ambassador John Tefft ""was sent to the opposition rally"" held Sunday, posting a picture of him facing a media scrum with protesters in the background.
&gt; 
&gt; Russia's President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of sparking protests against his rule, and state media frequently repeats the allegation, accusing protesters of taking money from foreign governments.
&gt; 
&gt; But the the US embassy said that the ambassador was nowhere near the protest and the ""fake"" picture involved a photo of the envoy at an event in February with the protest pasted into the background.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Ambassador Tefft spent his day off at home, but one can end up anywhere thanks to Photoshop,"" the embassy said on its official Facebook page, posting joke pictures of Tefft in a Moon landing and at a hockey match.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Russia's Ren TV published a fake,"" wrote embassy spokesman Will Stevens.
&gt; 
&gt; The Kremlin-loyal channel is part of the National Media Group holding which also owns Russia's most popular Channel One.
&gt; 
&gt; The channel backtracked on Monday, saying they merely shared a picture which was ""launched by bloggers"" and offered its ""apologies due to publishing misinformation.""
&gt; 
&gt; Russian channels have a history of publishing false information on their official social networking pages like Twitter, particularly about the conflict in Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; A recent tweet by the Zvezda channel, which is owned by the Russian defence ministry, took a photo of Ukrainian soldiers carrying a wounded comrade and pasted a picture of a cow on top of the soldiers body, headlining the story ""Ukrainian troops steal cattle from civilians.""",2016-11-14 20:48:44+00:00,da0as4m,2.0,t1_d9zwh2w,17653.0,politics

303,"&gt; Much ink has been spilled and many viral videos made arguing that Donald Trump won the election because liberals — college students, the media, the coastal clique — are out of touch with America. And their borderline hysteria over creeping authoritarianism since Trump’s surprise victory, the argument goes, just proves how out of touch they are.
&gt; 
&gt; But what about folks who have some experience with political earthquakes, and where the legacy of authoritarianism looms large? How do young liberals in what used to be called the Eastern Bloc view the rise of Trump?
&gt; 
&gt; The short answer is that the young intelligentsia — the liberal elite of Prague, Warsaw, Tbilisi, and Sofia — were surprised and disappointed, as were many of the liberal elite in the United States. “This has been a big blow to [those of] us believing in liberal, democratic America,” Nino Vardiashvili of Tbilisi, Georgia told Foreign Policy.
&gt; 
&gt; Marcin Buzanski, director of the Peace and Stabilization Strategies Programme at Pulaski Foundation in Warsaw, Poland noted that few expected Trump to win, and that nobody has a clue how he might turn his campaign rhetoric into governing. That’s not cause for optimism. Calling the election “extremely worrying,” he said, “We have actually felt what authoritarian rule means before, so if we see the signs that we’re heading this way, they should somehow be addressed and addressed quite quickly.”
&gt; 
&gt; Such sentiments were echoed by Matteo Mazzini, who is a doctoral student based in Warsaw. “When I was growing up in a freshly democratized Poland,” he said, “the United States was always shown as blueprint of a strong constitutional order, respect for civil liberties, a model we wanted to look up to, no matter who was in power. Now, however, for the past year the government in Poland has made all efforts possible to dismantle the Constitutional Court and tighten their grip on civic liberties, attacking women, immigrants, minorities. And since they control all branches of power, there is no way to stop them — I feel the U.S. runs a serious risk of going down the same path.”
&gt; 
&gt; In the Czech Republic, where Trump’s win was as surprising as anywhere else, “Many people are horrified,” said Jessie Hronesova, a Czech pursuing a doctorate in England. “I can give you the view of my parents. They lived through 1968 and 1989. They lived through the politics of truth and love of [Vaclav] Havel and then its gradual entanglement by [Vaclav] Klaus and [Milos] Zeman,” she said. “And now they are watching that liberal peace unravel across Europe and then the U.S., too.”
&gt; 
&gt; Still, many noted that one election does not an authoritarian system make, particularly because the United States has strong civic and political institutions.
&gt; 
&gt; “I don’t think you are in danger of authoritarianism — just four very unpleasant years,” said Johana Sedlackova Vamberska, a lecturer and businesswoman based in Prague. “Also, I believe that people who voted for Trump won’t gain any particular advantages during his presidency and, once they realize that, their support will weaken or vanish.”

A foundation which already had a agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative when Hillary became SoS. 

&gt; A Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, **which was permissible under the agreement**, but also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria for **earthquake relief in Haiti**, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review, but did not. Foundation officials said that if the former secretary decided to run for president in 2016, they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations.[73] But in general, they stressed that, ""As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.""

&gt; Charitable grants are not a major focus of the Clinton Foundation, which instead keeps most of its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs.[7] In September 2016, the charity watchdog group Charity Navigator gave it its highest possible rating, four out of four stars, after its customary review of the Foundation's financial records and tax statements.[8] A different charity monitor, CharityWatch, says that 88% of the foundation's money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an A rating for 2016. In 2015, based on revenue of $223 million and an expense ratio of 12% the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission.[9]",2016-11-14 20:13:52+00:00,da0915e,6.0,t1_da03x9v,6182.0,politics

&gt; **1980s: The 'fat picture'**
&gt; 
&gt; Former Trump employee Louise Sunshine, who worked from his from 1973-1985, told the Washington Post that the billionaire kept a 'fat picture' of her in his desk drawer, that he would take out when she did something he didn’t like.
&gt; 
&gt; She said it was “a reminder that I wasn’t perfect"" and added that she still remembers it today: “When I gain weight, I think of that picture.” 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **1992: There are no words**
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview with New York Magazine ('who keeps letting this guy speak to the press?' asked precisely no one), Trump uttered this charming phrase about women: 'You have to treat 'em like s----'.
&gt; 
&gt; **1994: When he demanded 'dinner on the table'**
&gt; 
&gt; In a 1994 interview with ABC News, Trump let rip on his perception of wifely duties.
&gt; 
&gt; “I have days where, if I come home — and I don't want to sound too much like a chauvinist,” the Republican said, “but when I come home and dinner's not ready, I go through the roof.”
&gt; 
&gt; He was married to Marla Maples at the time. In the same interview, he compared women to buildings and added that he gets bored when they become successful :
&gt; 
&gt; “I think that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing,” said Trump. “Unfortunately, after they're a star, the fun is over for me. It's like a creation process. It's almost like creating a building. It's pretty sad.”
&gt; 
&gt; **1997: When he said all women are gold diggers**
&gt; 
&gt; From seminal tome Trump: The Art of the Comeback on prenuptial agreements:
&gt; 
&gt; “There are basically three types of women and reactions. One is the good woman who very much loves her future husband, solely for himself, but refuses to sign the agreement on principle. I fully understand this, but the man should take a pass anyway and find someone else.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The other is the calculating woman who refuses to sign the prenuptial agreement because she is expecting to take advantage of the poor, unsuspecting sucker she’s got in her grasp. There is also the woman who will openly and quickly sign a prenuptial agreement in order to make a quick hit and take the money given to her.”
&gt; 
&gt; **2006: When he slagged off Rosie O’Donnell - part one**
&gt; 
&gt; It’s no secret that there’s no love lost between Trump and comedian O’Donnell. Perhaps his most notorious rant against her came on American TV show Entertainment Tonight in 2006, when he said: “Rosie O'Donnell is disgusting, both inside and out. If you take a look at her, she's a slob. How does she even get on television? If I were running The View, I'd fire Rosie. I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and say, 'Rosie, you're fired.'
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **2008: When he called Anne Hathaway a gold digger**
&gt; 
&gt; When the actress's marriage broke up, following her husband Raffello Follieri’s financial and legal troubles, Trump told Access Hollywood:
&gt; 
&gt; ""So when he had plenty of money, she liked him. But then after that, not as good, right?
&gt; 
&gt; **2011: When he called breastfeeding 'disgusting’** 
&gt; 
&gt; Trump was in court testifying in a deposition over a failed Florida real estate project when lawyer Elizabeth Beck asked to take a break to breastfeed her three-month old daughter.
&gt; 
&gt; The property mogul and his team objected, so she pulled out her breast pump to prove it. In an incident that Trump ""does not dispute"", he walked out of the room, telling Beck she was ""disgusting"".
&gt; 
&gt; **2011: When he called a female journalist a ‘dog’**
&gt; 
&gt; After New York Times columnist Gail Collins wrote about rumours of Trump’s bankruptcy, he sent her a copy of her own article, with her picture circled and ""the face of a dog!"" scrawled across it.
&gt; 
&gt; **August 8, 2015: When he used the word 'bimbo'**
&gt; 
&gt; After the debate, Trump responded by seeming to call her a ""bimbo"" on Twitter.
&gt; 
&gt; And in a later CNN interview, he suggested her questioning was a result of her menstruating: ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever."" Trump has denied this was his intention.
&gt; 
&gt; @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly  Fox viewers give low marks to bimbo @MegynKelly will consider other programs!""
&gt; 
&gt; **September 9, 2015: When he insulted Carly Fiorina**
&gt; 
&gt; Carly Fiorina is the former Hewlett-Packard boss and Trump’s Republican rival. According to Rolling Stone magazine, he said: ""Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that?
&gt; 
&gt; ""Can you imagine that, the face of our next next president? I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?""
&gt; **
&gt; November 10, 2015: When he insulted Fiorina - part two**
&gt; 
&gt; Trump singled out his female Republican rival for a dressing down, ignoring the fact that his male counterparts were also talking over one another.
&gt; 
&gt; His comment - ""Why does she keep interrupting everybody?"" - was immediately called sexist on social media.
&gt; 
&gt; **March 30, 2016: When he said abortion was 'punishable'** 
&gt; 
&gt; Trump caused mass outage after advocating ""some form of punishment"" for women who have abortions if the practice is banned (which it likely will be if he gets his way).
&gt; 
&gt; The Republican said he has ""evolved"" on the issue of abortion. He was pro-choice for years before changing his position and backing a ban. He believes the Supreme Court ruling legalising abortion should be overturned and that individual states should be allowed to ban it. His campaign said he believes abortion should be legal only in instances of rape, incest or when the life of the mother was at stake.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There has to be some form of punishment,"" he told MSNBC, referring to women who would seek to defy the ban.
&gt; 
&gt; **September 30, 2016: When he called a woman 'Miss Piggy'**
&gt; 
&gt; This one actually dates back to 1996. But in the early hours of the morning, in September 2016, Trump posted a series of comments on Twitter continuing his attack on the former Miss Universe winner and Venezuelan actress Alicia Machado. 
&gt; 
&gt; Machado's name had been raised by Hillary Clinton, during the first Presidential debate, when she accused Trump of having called the model ""fat"". Miss Machado has claimed Mr Trump called her ""Miss Piggy"" and ""Miss Housekeeping"".

&gt;**October 7, 2016: When video emerged of him talking about 'grabbing' (women) 'by the p----'**

&gt;Mr Trump hit a new low after the emergence of a video in which he discusses ""grabbing (women) by the p----"" and states that “when you’re a star, they let you do it”.

&gt;The 70-year-old uses lewd and sexually aggressive language to brag about groping and trying to have sex with women, including someone who was married, in footage obtained by the Washington Post.

&gt;In the video, Trump is recorded talking about an unnamed woman to Billy Bush, who was a host for Access Hollywood, a TV entertainment show.

&gt;“I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it,” Trump says. “I did try and f--- her. She was married.

&gt;“And I moved on her very heavily... I moved on her like a b----, but I couldn’t get there. And she was married.""

&gt;**October 13, 2016: When a tape showed him leering at a 10-year-old girl**

&gt;Those leaks just won't be plugged. Another unearthed tape of Trump from a 1992 appearance on TV show Entertainment Tonight, showed the billionaire watching a group of young girls going up the escalator in Trump Tower.

&gt;""I am going to be dating her in 10 years. Can you believe it?"" he is heard saying of one of them. He was 46 at the time.

All of this combined is the behavior of a man who despises women and think he's better than them. 

I guess we will say goodbye then and good for you for voting democrat! Have a good evening!

336,"&gt; Donald Trump's campaign CEO Stephen Bannon was branded an anti-Semite by the same ex-wife who claimed he choked her, court documents reveal.
&gt; 
&gt; Mary Louise Piccard said in a 2007 court declaration that Bannon didn't want their twin daughters attending the Archer School for Girls in Los Angeles because many Jewish students were enrolled at the elite institution.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,"" Piccard said in her statement signed on June 27, 2007.
&gt; 
&gt; ""He said that he doesn't like the way they raise their kids to be 'whiny brats' and that he didn't want the girls going to school with Jews,"" Piccard wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; Stephen Bannon, Trump campaign CEO, allegedly attacked ex-wife
&gt; ""I told him that there are children who are Jewish at (a competing school), and he asked me what the percentage was. I told him that I didn't know because it wasn't an issue for me as I am not raising the girls to be either anti-Semitic or prejudiced against anyone,"" she wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; Bannon asked his ex-wife if it bothered her that a second school, the Willows Community School, used to be a Temple.
&gt; 
&gt; And while checking out yet another school, Bannon asked the director during a sit down why there were “so many Chanukah books in the library.”
&gt; 
&gt; “At the time, Mr. Bannon never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education.” a spokeswoman for Bannon told the Daily News.
&gt; 
&gt; Piccard and Bannon were locked in a contentious child custody war when she accused him of the bigoted behavior a decade after first filing for divorce.

337,"&gt; President-elect Donald Trump sent conflicting messages about his hopes for the supreme court on Sunday, saying he will appoint justices who will send abortion rights “back to the states”, but not those who seek to repeal marriage equality “because it was already settled”.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump made the comments in his first broadcast interview as president-elect, with CBS’s 60 Minutes, which aired on Sunday evening.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump also suggested he might retain parts of Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms, and said that he intends to deport as many as 3 million undocumented migrants with criminal records.
&gt; 
&gt; The supreme court currently has eight members, after the death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February, since when Senate Republicans have refused to even consider Obama’s nominee for the seat, Merrick Garland.
&gt; 
&gt; The vacant seat became a central campaign issue for conservatives, and CBS host Lesley Stahl asked Trump whether he would appoint a supreme court justice who wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that upheld the right to abortion.

&gt; “So look,” Trump said. “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to – I’m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life.”
&gt; 
&gt; Pressed, he said: “Having to do with abortion – if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states.” That did not mean women would not be able to get an abortion, Trump said, but “they’ll perhaps have to go, they’ll have to go to another state”.
&gt; 
&gt; “Well, we’ll see what happens,” he added. “It’s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.”
&gt; 
&gt; In March, Trump suggested that women should face “some form of punishment” for having abortions, before reversing and saying states and Congress should lead lawmaking.
&gt; 
&gt; Asked by Stahl whether he supported marriage equality, which was made law by the supreme court in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015, Trump suggested the case did not concern him to the degree of Roe v Wade.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s irrelevant,” he said, “Because it was already settled. It’s law. It was settled in the supreme court. I mean it’s done.”",2016-11-14 00:21:49+00:00,d9z4ulf,1.0,t3_5ct19j,234.0,politics

&gt; The New York Times asked Trump if he’d object to Japan or South Korea having nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump responded, ""At some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. ... And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem.""

&gt; 
&gt; CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Trump, ""If you're concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn't that proliferation?""
&gt; 
&gt; As part of a winding response, Trump said that he both opposes nuclear proliferation (""No, no, not proliferation. I hate nuclear more than any;"" ""I don't want more nuclear weapons"") and supports some countries obtaining nuclear weapons for the first time.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" he asked Cooper.
&gt; 
&gt; Cooper also asked Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?""
&gt; 
&gt; Trump: ""Saudi Arabia, absolutely.""
&gt; 
&gt; Cooper: ""You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?""
&gt; 
&gt; Trump: ""No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves, or they have to pay us.""

&gt; 
&gt; Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace asked Trump, ""You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?""

&gt; Trump: ""In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.""

359,"&gt; Donald Trump’s business empire owes hundreds of millions of dollars to a giant German bank cast into crisis by settlement negotiations with the Justice Department, a relationship some lawyers say sheds light on the massive financial entanglements he could face as president.
&gt; 
&gt; Federal regulators are seeking a $14 billion fine from Deutsche Bank, Trump’s top lender, to settle claims that the bank issued toxic mortgages amid the housing crisis. German media have suggested the bank has sought a state bailout that could lead to partial ownership of the bank by the German government.
&gt; 
&gt; A settlement could be reached before a new president takes office, but government-ethics experts say the Deutsche Bank situation is a stark reminder of how Trump could face a conflicting set of interests as the nation's negotiator in chief.
&gt; 
&gt; As head of the executive branch, he’d oversee the Justice Department and the United States' relations with the rest of the world. But he’d still have a lengthy series of financial relationships with private institutions and countries with business before the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s certainly foreseeable that he could intervene with the DOJ so as to not upset the financing of his companies,” said Trevor Potter, a former Federal Election Commission chairman and general counsel of George H.W. Bush and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; If Deutsche’s financial health was in danger, that could also potentially threaten Trump’s corporate interests, because the bank could freeze future lending to his companies. If the German government partially owned the bank, lawyers said, Trump’s dual rule as a business executive and chief diplomat could come into conflict.
&gt; 
&gt; **“The level of entanglements here are unprecedented,”** said Ken Gross, the former elections enforcement official and lawyer who has advised presidential candidates from both parties, speaking generally outside the Deutsche case.
&gt; 
&gt; **“He’ll have to deal with conflict entanglements almost on a daily basis**, based on the holdings he has, particularly those involving international issues. It’s just going to plague him, one way or another.”

For instance, events were sometimes portrayed in Klanwatch Intelligence Reports as more militant and dangerous with higher turnouts than we observed.""[122] Rory McVeigh, the chair of the University of Notre Dame Sociology Department, wrote that ""its outstanding reputation is well established, and the SPLC has been an excellent source of information for social scientists who study racist organizations.""[111]

378,"[Found this which could be relevant](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/06/07/can-the-white-house-revoke-a-reporters-credentials/):

&gt; To get accredited for the White House, a reporter first needs to be approved for a congressional press pass by the Standing Committee of Correspondents, elected by accredited reporters. (A notable exception to this rule was Jeff Gannon of the conservative website Talon News, who was repeatedly allowed to ask — usually friendly — questions during the George W. Bush administration’s White House press briefings despite never being given a congressional pass. Gannon’s presence in the press room became a minor scandal when liberal bloggers revealed that he had posted X-rated pictures of himself on the Internet and had worked as a gay escort.)
&gt; 
&gt; Among other requirements, congressional reporters must demonstrate that they work for a publication whose ""principal business is the daily dissemination of original news and opinion of interest to a broad segment of the public"" and is ""editorially independent of any institution, foundation or interest group that lobbies the federal government."" The White House also requires an additional Secret Service background check. The White House Correspondents‘ Association (WHCA), a professional association of journalists who cover the president, is not involved in the credentialing process, and White House reporters are not required to be WHCA members.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you’ve got the pass, you can renew it every year without additional scrutiny. More than 2,000 reporters have ""hard passes"" to the White House, though the vast majority don’t work out of the building every day and the briefing room seats just 50 people, with standing room for about another 30.
&gt; 
&gt; Because administrations generally don’t want to be seen as deciding who is or isn’t a qualified journalist, it’s unheard of for a reporter to be suspended for the quality of his or her reporting or behavior, though there are a few notable cases of reporters being barred for security reasons.
____

&gt;Other dubious press corps veterans include Baltimore radio host Les Kinsolving, who covers the White House for the conspiratorially minded website WorldNetDaily. On the rare occasions when he gets called on, Kinsolving is known for launching into opinionated diatribes that only occasionally take the form of questions. Lately he has become fixated on the authenticity of President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Kinsolving bills himself on his own website as ""one of the few who has the guts to ask probing questions and even providing [sic] comic relief.""

415,"&gt; In the U.S., the Kremlin is hacking emails. In the Balkans, it’s staging coups.
&gt; 
&gt; For the past few months, Americans have been contemplating the possibility that the integrity of their electoral process may have been compromised.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence is compelling. The U.S. government has officially pointed to Russia as the culprit in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, and the FBI suspects that Moscow hacked into Hillary Clinton’s campaign emails. And yet, whatever meddling Russia has been doing in the United States has so far remained subtle enough to leave a shadow of doubt among at least some Americans regarding what is actually taking place.
&gt; 
&gt; Not so in the Balkans. Americans looking for a glimpse at what it looks like when the Kremlin really, really wants to mess with an election and its aftermath need only look at recent events in this part of southern Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; The Balkan states have become an important soft power target for Moscow, which worries about NATO and European Union encroachment in its near abroad, as well as the presence of more or less successful models of democratic transitions on its doorstep. It therefore seeks to block further NATO expansion there and slow progress toward joining the EU. Failing that, Russia aims to increase its influence within various Balkan states, with a view toward using this to its advantage in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; But the region has been inching westward, attracted by the prospect of European standards of living as well as Western freedoms. Many Balkan countries are already in NATO or the EU, or on track to enter.
&gt; 
&gt; Moscow has not given up on the Balkans, however. It relies on Orthodox churches to preach Slavic solidarity, crony deals for oil and gas, rigged privatizations to enrich its favored politicians, and encourages ethnic nationalists — especially in the security forces — to pursue a pro-Russian, pan-Slavic agenda. Brexit, the tottering euro, and an American presidential candidate who sounds like an ethnic nationalist and admires Vladimir Putin have made it easier for Russia and its surrogates to argue that the EU is on its last legs, while Washington is turning in Moscow’s direction.Brexit, the tottering euro, and an American presidential candidate who sounds like an ethnic nationalist and admires Vladimir Putin have made it easier for Russia and its surrogates to argue that the EU is on its last legs, while Washington is turning in Moscow’s direction.

421,"Some highlights:
&gt; 
&gt; For most of the world, Donald Trump’s election feels like a nightmare that lacks that one saving grace. For the last few days we have all been in free fall, with the ground fast approaching, except that we also know we are wide awake.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump May Undermine America’s Liberal Democracy**
&gt; 
&gt; First and foremost, we must not underestimate the possibility that Donald Trump may prove a serious threat to liberal democracy in the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; **He May Kill the Dream of a Multiethnic Democracy**
&gt; 
&gt; It is rarely noted that democracy took hold in many European countries at the precise moment when decades of war and ethnic cleansing had turned them extremely homogeneous. This is probably no coincidence. In the modern era, democracy has always gone hand-in-hand with nationalism. And the popular perception of who truly belongs to these nations has, in turn, been deeply restrictive. In most times and places, you did not truly belong to the volk unless you descended from the same ethnic stock as the majority of your co-citizens.
&gt; 
&gt; **The Illiberal International Will Be on the March**
&gt; 
&gt; During the election campaign, global opinion polls showed an overwhelming preference for Hillary Clinton in most parts of the world. But these polls missed a crucial detail: among the illiberal populists who are now on the rise in such diverse countries as France, Sweden, Hungary and Russia, Trump has always enjoyed strong support.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump May Embolden Dictators Around The World**
&gt; 
&gt; During the election campaign, much was made of Donald Trump’s praise of Vladimir Putin. Some journalists even speculated that Trump or some of his close advisors might have a personal financial interest in an alliance with Putin. But that misses a much scarier point: Trump praises Putin because he genuinely likes the guy — and much of what he stands for.
&gt; 
&gt; **America’s Allies May Start Looking Elsewhere**
&gt; 
&gt; Even in the best case, American foreign policy will remain unpredictable for the coming years. For countries whose security has always depended on the reliability of their American allies, this is deeply scary. For now, they will be extremely vulnerable to the caprices of President Trump.",2016-11-12 14:08:57+00:00,d9x5qpm,1.0,t3_5ckhzs,465.0,politics

428,"Looked through each point and I think everyone should be aware of them. Here's a short part from each point: 

1. Rule #1: **Believe the autocrat. He means what he says.** Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the unacceptable. 

1. Rule #2: **Do not be taken in by small signs of normality.** Consider the financial markets this week, which, having tanked overnight, rebounded following the Clinton and Obama speeches. Confronted with political volatility, the markets become suckers for calming rhetoric from authority figures. So do people. Panic can be neutralized by falsely reassuring words about how the world as we know it has not ended. 

1. Rule #3: **Institutions will not save you.** It took Putin a year to take over the Russian media and four years to dismantle its electoral system; the judiciary collapsed unnoticed. The capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even faster, by a man once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey into the EU. Poland has in less than a year undone half of a quarter century’s accomplishments in building a constitutional democracy.

1. Rule #4: **Be outraged.** If you follow Rule #1 and believe what the autocrat-elect is saying, you will not be surprised. But in the face of the impulse to normalize, it is essential to maintain one’s capacity for shock. This will lead people to call you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of overreacting. It is no fun to be the only hysterical person in the room. Prepare yourself.

1. Rule #5: **Don’t make compromises**. Like Ted Cruz, who made the journey from calling Trump “utterly amoral” and a “pathological liar” to endorsing him in late September to praising his win as an “amazing victory for the American worker,” Republican politicians have fallen into line. Conservative pundits who broke ranks during the campaign will return to the fold. Democrats in Congress will begin to make the case for cooperation, for the sake of getting anything done—or at least, they will say, minimizing the damage. 

1. Rule #6: **Remember the future. Nothing lasts forever**. Donald Trump certainly will not, and Trumpism, to the extent that it is centered on Trump’s persona, will not either. Failure to imagine the future may have lost the Democrats this election. They offered no vision of the future to counterbalance Trump’s all-too-familiar white-populist vision of an imaginary past.

&gt; 
&gt; President-elect Trump could hold sway over regulators’ investigations into banks that have lent his businesses hundreds of millions of dollars. He’ll be directing relations with foreign governments, such as Saudi Arabia’s, whose rulers have bought everything from real estate to a yacht from him as he struggled to pay off debts.

He added bluntly: “I hope the election campaign is now over and it is not yet time to panic.”

&gt;  Some are neo-fascist, neo-Nazi or Third Positionist; others are politicised around some form of white ethnic nationalism or identity politics,[70] and a few have national anarchist tendencies. 
&gt; 
&gt; Some critics argue that white nationalists — while posturing as civil rights groups advocating the interests of their racial group — frequently draw on the nativist traditions of the KKK and the British National Front.[80] Critics have noted the anti-semitic rhetoric used by some white nationalists, as highlighted by the promotion of conspiracy theories such as Zionist Occupation Government.[81]

456,"&gt; During Donald Trump's presidential campaign, in which he embraced hard-line immigration policies championed by white nationalists, his backers scoffed at the idea that he was winking at the white nationalists who cheered him on. But the ties between Trump and far-right white nationalist groups are coming into focus. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has joined Trump's transition team to advise him on immigration, spoke last year at a conference for a white nationalist group.
&gt; 
&gt; Last October, Kobach was a featured speaker at a writers' workshop hosted by the Social Contract Press in Washington, DC. The Southern Poverty Law Centers has designated the press as an anti-immigrant hate group for its ties to white nationalists and for publishing their work. As its website notes, ""Recent articles in its main product, The Social Contract, have propagated the myth that Latino activists want to occupy and 'reclaim' the American Southwest, argued that no Muslim immigrants should be allowed into the U.S., and claimed that multiculturalists are trying to replace 'successful Euro-American culture' with 'dysfunctional Third World cultures.'""
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than apologize for speaking at the event, Kobach, who is well known as the legal architect of anti-immigrant policies across the country,  defended the group. He has ties to its founder. In May, the white nationalist website VDARE.com, another SPLC-designated hate website that publishes race scientists and anti-Semites, called on Trump to pick Kobach as his running mate. He is now one step closer to President-elect Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if Newt Gingrich is right that one of Trump's signature promises was just a ""campaign device,"" Trump's appointment of Kobach would indicate that he remains committed to the anti-immigrant stances he campaigned on.

So now there's an [anti-LGBTQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ca6lq/antilgbtq_extremists_tapped_for_roles_on_trump/) adviser, an anti-immigrant adviser and oh yeah Mike ""Anti-gay"" Pence and [Stephen ""I hate Jews"" Bannon as possible WH Chief of staff](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/796824306105876480).

&gt; [FBI ‘Granted FISA Warrant’ Covering Trump Camp’s Ties To Russia](http://heatst.com/world/exclusive-fbi-granted-fisa-warrant-covering-trump-camps-ties-to-russia/).
&gt; 
&gt; Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; Contrary to earlier reporting in the New York Times, which cited FBI sources as saying that the agency did not believe that the private server in Donald Trump’s Trump Tower which was connected to a Russian bank had any nefarious purpose, the FBI’s counter-intelligence arm, sources say, re-drew an earlier FISA court request around possible financial and banking offenses related to the server. The first request, which, sources say, named Trump, was denied back in June, but the second was drawn more narrowly and was granted in October after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia’s Alfa Bank. While the Times story speaks of metadata, sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons.
&gt; 
&gt; The FBI agents who talked to the New York Times, and rubbished the ground-breaking stories of Slate ( Franklin Foer) and Mother Jones (David Corn) may not have known about the FISA warrant, sources say, because the counter-intelligence and criminal sides of the FBI often work independently of each other employing the principle of ‘compartmentalization’.
&gt; 
&gt; The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank. However, it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any ‘US person’ connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates. The warrant was sought, they say, because actionable intelligence on the matter provided by friendly foreign agencies could not properly be examined without a warrant by US intelligence as it involves ‘US Persons’ who come under the remit of the FBI and not the CIA. Should a counter-intelligence investigation lead to criminal prosecutions, sources say, the Justice Department is concerned that the chain of evidence have a basis in a clear  warrant.

507,"That's not how a blind trust would work. Conflicts of interest would be severe and a national security risk. 
&gt; 

&gt; The onslaught of words, to the uninformed, may have sounded persuasive. Voters could be excused for thinking the Trumps had solved the problem. They haven’t. Worse, if the Trumps believe what they are saying, there is no question a President Trump would be America’s most conflicted chief executive, forcing the United States to confront a problem that would be unprecedented.
&gt; 
&gt; The Newsweek article dug into the deals of the Trump Organization, a private entity with a global web of financial ties. The company—which made its name as a real estate developer and a (failed) casino operator—has not been in either business for years.
&gt; 
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt;** These conflicts cannot be resolved with the simpleminded solutions offered by the Trump family. Start with Trump’s “blind trust” argument. Politicians using a blind trust hand over their investment portfolios to independent third parties that make trades of stocks and bonds without seeking permission or informing the politician. As a result, the politician doesn’t know what is in the trading account, thus eliminating the danger that financial interests will influence governmental decisions**.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Trump says he will “sever” his relationship with the Trump Organization, and his children will be running the company and will be its primary financial beneficiaries. In a true blind trust, the beneficiary continues to receive the financial rewards of the investment. So will money keep flowing to Trump? He won’t say. And it doesn’t matter, because it is clear he could easily enrich his kids and “their” company from the Oval Office.
&gt; ___
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, there was the explanation of this blind trust ruse advanced by Ivanka Trump on Good Morning America. Regarding the Newsweek article, she said, “There’s something so much bigger than our business at stake, and that's the future of this country. As a private business, we can make decisions that are not in our best interest…. We can say, ‘You know what? We'll do less deals,’ and, ‘Not going to do that deal, even though it's a fine deal.’ It's economically reasonable because it could create a conflict of interest, and we'll act incredibly responsibly.”Let’s unpack this stunning statement. First, note that it contains an admission that Trump Organization deals would create multiple conflicts of interest for a President Trump. Second, we should just trust the Trump children to figure out which deals they pursue could affect American national security. Unless Ivanka Trump is suggesting that she and her brothers will be in the White House for foreign policy and national security briefings, or that their dad will give them occasional phone calls to discuss classified information, how will the Trump children know how to steer clear of U.S. foreign policy?

519,"It's not misleading. There's a reason why Carter Page and Paul Manafort is under investigation for their dealings with Russia while working for Trump. Also if it wasn't an issue why did the Trump campaign try to distance themselves after all this broke out?

&gt; [Intelligence officials in the United States are investigating whether Carter Page](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/23/trump-advisor-under-investigation-for-russia-ties-report/), a businessman described by Donald Trump as a foreign policy advisor, has been making backroom promises to Moscow to lift some sanctions against top Kremlin officials if Trump is elected.
&gt; 
&gt; In recent briefings with senior members of Congress about apparent attempts by Moscow to influence the presidential contest between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, intelligence officials have raised concerns about Page’s travels to Moscow, according to a Yahoo News report on Friday afternoon. Intelligence officials believe Page has had meetings with Russian officials currently sanctioned by the Treasury Department for involvement in Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.” Many top Kremlin officials and business associates of President Vladimir Putin are in U.S. sanctions crosshairs.

&gt;[But U.S. officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip](https://www.yahoo.com/news/u-s-intel-officials-probe-ties-between-trump-adviser-and-kremlin-175046002.html), Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft, Russian’s leading oil company, a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News. That meeting, if confirmed, is viewed as especially problematic by U.S. officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russia’s “illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine.” (The Treasury announcement described Sechin as “utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin — a key component to his current standing.” At their alleged meeting, Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page, the Western intelligence source said.

&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow — Igor Diveykin. A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.

531,"&gt;MOSCOW — Russian government officials had contacts with members of Donald Trump’s campaign team, a senior Russian diplomat said Thursday, in a report that could reopen scrutiny over the Kremlin’s role in the president-elect’s bitter race against Hillary Clinton.

&gt;Facing questions about his ties to Moscow because of his statements in favor of Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, Trump repeatedly denied having any contact with the Russian government.  

&gt;But Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with the state-run Interfax news agency, said that ""there were contacts"" with the Trump team.

&gt;""Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,” Rybakov said. “Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives.”

546,"&gt; Water boarding is not torture and it's a valuable tool. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed proved that to us.

No it didn't. Read it again if you actually believe that. Waterboarding does meet the legal definition of torture and I will quote this again from the United Nations Convention Against Torture:

&gt; “torture” means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession… when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public office or other person acting in an official capacity.",2016-11-10 00:54:44+00:00,d9to0yo,6.0,t1_d9tnr9t,375.0,politics

548,"&gt; For the purposes of this Convention, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is ...

Torture doesn't have to leave permanent physical injuries or scarring. 

And about [Khalid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed#Transfer_to_Guant.C3.A1namo_and_hearing_before_his_Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal) what you're saying isn't quite true at all.

&gt; CIA officials have previously told ABC News that ""Mohammed lasted the longest under waterboarding, two and a half minutes, before beginning to talk.""[90] **Legal experts say this could taint all his statements. Forensic psychiatrist Michael Welner, M.D., an expert in false confessions, observed from the testimony transcript that his concerns about his family may have been far more influential in soliciting Mohammed’s cooperation than any earlier reported mistreatment**.[91]

&gt; **One CIA official cautioned that ""many of Mohammed's claims during interrogation were 'white noise' designed to send the U.S. on wild goose chases or to get him through the day's interrogation session**."" 

&gt;For example, according to Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and the top Republican on the terrorism panel of the House Intelligence Committee, he admitted responsibility for the Bali nightclub bombing, but his involvement ""could have been as small as arranging a safe house for travel. It could have been arranging finance."" Mohammed also made the admission that he was ""responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center Operation,"" which killed six and injured more than 1,000 when a bomb was detonated in an underground garage, Mohammed did not plan the attack, but he may have supported it. Michael Welner noted that by offering legitimate information to interrogators, Mohammed had secured the leverage to provide misinformation as well.[92]

&gt; In an article discussing the reliability of Khalid's confession and the motive for giving misinformation under torture, Ali Soufan, a former FBI special agent with considerable experience interrogating al-Qaeda operatives, pointed out that:

&gt; **When they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you're getting is useless**.

&gt; His words are echoed by the US Army Training Manual's section on interrogation, which suggests that:

&gt; **the use of force is a poor technique, as it ... can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear**.
&gt; 
&gt; **As an example of this the article discloses that although the George W. Bush administration made claims that the water-boarding (simulated drowning) of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed produced vital information that allowed them to break up a plot to attack the U.S. Bank Tower (formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center) in Los Angeles in 2002, this has been proven to be untrue**. In 2002 Shaikh Mohammed was busy evading capture in Pakistan.[93] **Likewise the claim by the Obama administration that torture of Kahlid Mohammed led to the lead in finding Osama Bin Laden has also been shown to be false**. 

&gt;According to U.S. Senator John McCain, ""The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times... **not only did the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed; it actually produced false and misleading information**.",2016-11-10 00:39:42+00:00,d9tndzs,2.0,t1_d9tn1lr,496.0,politics
549,"He should call Sean Hannity and ask how his waterboarding test went.

EDIT: 

Everyone claiming that [waterboarding isn't torture should watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUkj9pjx3H0) and read more about a specific case regarding [Khalid Sheik Mohammed](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5c4tih/sen_tom_cotton_waterboarding_isnt_torture/d9tndzs/) which I wrote about in a reply to another comment which showed that waterboarding most likely will lead to false statements and misinformation. 

Also waterboarding does meet the legal definition of torture according to the UN Convention against torture:

&gt; “torture” means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession… when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public office or other person acting in an official capacity.

&gt;[In addition, U.S. federal law \(18 USC Section 2340\) defines torture as something that “specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering” — and of course, the U.S. Constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual punishment.”](http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/ted-cruz-is-wrong-waterboarding-is-considered-legal-torture-by-most/) 


Also worth mentioning are the torture scenes in **Zero Dark Thirty** which gives the impression that waterboarding actually worked for the CIA in their search for Bin Laden, this is actually not accurate. 

&gt;[ Zero Dark Thirty'](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/25/zero-dark-thirty-reel-history)s torture scenes create the impression that these interrogations provided early clues as to the identity of Osama bin Laden's courier, who would ultimately lead the CIA to the man himself. This has outraged some US senators, including John McCain, who deny that in the strongest terms on the basis of their access to classified CIA material which is still not publicly available. The CIA document mentioned above says that: ""The Agency's detention and interrogation of terrorists has provided intelligence that has enabled the identification and apprehension of other terrorists."" This does not relate explicitly to the finding of Bin Laden, and not merely because the document was written before he was found. As war on terror expert Jane Mayer has pointed out, former CIA director Leon Panetta has stated that ""we first learned about 'the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre' from a detainee not in the CIA's custody"" and that ""no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts"".
&gt; 

&gt; Along with what the senators have said, and further evidence quoted by Mayer and others, this appears to corroborate the view that torture interrogations were irrelevant to finding Bin Laden. ""Torture was, however, as we all know, employed in the early years of the hunt,"" Bigelow wrote. ""That doesn't mean it was the key to finding Bin Laden. It means it is a part of the story we couldn't ignore."" That depends on which story you're telling. Torture is part of the story of how the CIA operated in the early 2000s. Based on currently available evidence, though, there is a strong case to argue that torture is not part of the story of finding Bin Laden.

&gt; Officials in Ukraine had expressed fear prior to the vote that a Trump presidency could see them thrown under the bus in favour of improved ties with Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; The three Baltic states were similarly tentative in their welcome to the newcomer on the world stage.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has previously suggested his administration could be less committed to Nato and would not automatically defend a Nato country under attack, statements that have worried leaders in the three Baltic nations – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia – who fear a newly assertive Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; Lithuania’s president Dalia Grybauskaite said the US remained “our firmest and closest ally”. But the country’s incoming prime minister Saulius Skvernelis said that he hoped Trump’s remarks on defence and Russia were campaign rhetoric. He added bluntly: “I hope the election campaign is now over and it is not yet time to panic.”
&gt; 
&gt; The mood in Latvia was also anxious. Latvian MEP Sandra Kalniete said the result showed the US embracing isolationism, which would weaken American involvement in Nato. In Estonia, meanwhile, the government collapsed yesterday, after prime minister Taavi Roivas lost a no-confidence vote in parliament. This could see a pro-Russian party join the ruling coalition.

603,"&gt;  Han har lyckats väl i affärsvärlden.

Bland det roligaste jag läst på /r/Sweden haha. Ingen seriös affärsman håller med dig kan jag säga. Han är en en av de sämsta affärsmän någonsin. Om han bara investera pengarna han ärvde i fonder så hade han varit rikare idag.

Nu för tiden får han inte ens längre låna pengar från amerikanska banker för han har gått i konkurs så ofta och lurat en massa människor, nu lånar han istället från Deutsche bank och licenserar ut sitt namn till olika människor som vill försöka tjäna en slant det är därför han satsar på Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Trump Taj, Trump Castle, Trump Plaza, Trump Dubai, Trump University, Trump Toronto, Trump Hollywood, TrumpMortgage, TrumpFinancial, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, Trump Shuttle, http://GoTrump.com m fl. Alla dom har misslyckats förresten. 

Han har endast överlevt genom att låna mer och mer pengar från sin pappa, samt tvättat pengar genom sina kasinon, gjort affärer med skumma typer i Azerbaijan, Ryssland, Iran, Saudi och har sysslat med lobbying för att Sydkorea ska få kärnvapen för 8 miljoner dollar varje år. Han har även flera kopplingar till Rysk maffia och maffiabossar i USA och även olika diktatorer som Gaddafi t ex.

Många av hans affärspartners i andra länder är under utredning av olika anledningar och ofta för bedrägeri på olika sätt.

Hans tre kasinon tog kunder ifrån varandra vilket gjorde att alla gick åt helvete, inte bra business.

Han har ljugit regelbundet i rätten om hur han skött sina affärer, förstört rättsliga dokument som behövdes för utredningar och fördröjt rättegångar med flera år för att dra ut på det hela så kostnaderna för hans motståndare skulle bli skyhöga. 

Att han fick 1 miljon är också en lögn, egentligen så fick han uppemot 100 miljoner av sin pappa och har dessutom lånat pengar från flertal människor som han aldrig betalat tillbaka. På tal om det så har han varit i rätten flera gånger för att han vägrat betala småföretagare som jobbat åt honom för att han har tyckt att dom inte gjort ett tillräckligt bra jobb trots att dom gjort det och när dom vågat säga emot så han har hotat dom med alla hans advokater. 

Han har också påstått att han är värd minst 8 miljarder dollar men det har visat sig vara lögn. Deutsche bank uppger att han endast är värd runt 700 miljoner medan forbes har uppget ca 3 miljarder. Trump själv har sagt att hans värde beror på vilket humör han är på den dagen!!

På tal om krig så har Trump begärt militären att begå minst tre krigsbrott, frågat högt uppsatta militärer om varför dom inte kan använda kärnvapen när dom ändå har dom och har uppget att han gärna vill att fler länder ska ha kärnvapen. Att säga att han skulle vara den minst krigiska presidenten sedan Carter är skrattretande. Isånnafall har du verkligen ingen koll på något han har sagt sen han startade sin kampanj eller innan. 

Han har själv sagt att han inte skulle låta hånande Iranier komma undan med att dom reta amerikanska fartyg och sa at han hade startat krig med dom om han fick bestämma. Hans militärkunskaper är skrattretande samtidigt som dom är otroligt läskiga för han har så extremt lite koll på hur allting faktiskt fungerar. 

Han hade även låtit Ryssland ta en större roll i mellanöstern och baltländerna och eventuellt Skandinavien genom att försvaga NATO-länderna. 

För att sammanfatta: han har i princip gjort allt man inte ska göra för att få kalla sig en lyckad affärsman. Han är en av dem farligaste politikerna någonsin för han kan bli så lätt manipulerad och triggad av bara ett tweet och om han blev president hade ekonomin gått åt helvete för alla länder.

&gt; Could this be the reason Carter Page stepped down from Trump's campaign last September?

&gt;&gt; In September, the scientists tried to get the public to pay attention to their data. One of them posted a link to the logs in a Reddit thread. Soon, the New York Times’ Eric Lichtblau and Steven Lee Myers began chasing the story. (They are still pursuing it.) Lichtblau met with a Washington representative of Alfa Bank on Sept. 21, and the bank denied having any connection to Trump. (Lichtblau told me that Times policy prevents him from commenting on his reporting.)

&gt; He steps down on September 26th:

&gt;&gt; One of Donald Trump's foreign policy advisers said Monday he was stepping down from the campaign, while pushing back on allegations that he had engaged in private communications with top Russian officials.
&gt; Carter Page said in an interview with Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin that the claims were ""just complete garbage,” but nonetheless he had chosen to take a leave of absence from campaign become the accusations were causing a ""distraction.""

&gt; EDIT:
&gt; So Clinton just tweeted about this so this is definitely getting in the news now.

&gt; [No he's (Trump) too stupid for that but someone using that server might be in contact with Kremlin or an associate in Alfa Bank.

EDIT:

 So for some reason you sent tons of pm's instead of replying here and I'm going to include our convo here because you semi-answered to me here but also in pm's.:


**Suzerain1:**

Can you kindly explain why I am racist for asking ""Waht did black Hillary voters think about white People"" raccist, but the other way around is not racist?

**Wyldcat:**

Because you seem to assume that all black people are the same.

**Suzerain1:**

Exactly
I was making a point about the article and how hypocritical it was, not commenting on black people.
What I asked was prejudice/ignoratn, but it was asked to point out how racist the article you linked was as well..... The article was talking about white trump voters, I was talking about black hillary supporters. Either both should be OK to stereotype, or neither.
Why are black Hillary supporters not OK to stereotype/make generalizations about but white trump supporters its OK to do so?

**Wyldcat:**

They did a survey. There's been many surveys pointing to Trump supporters being in some way very racist.
It's as simple as that. It's not about stereotyping.
This article isn't racist for making a survey which shows that more than one third Trump supporters see black people as less evolved. The racism are in those trump supporters.
and I don't think that amount of black clinton voters would view white people as less evolved.

**Suzerain1:**

according to crime statistics blackks murder at 10x the rate whites do. Is it wrong to seterotype them for that since there is data to back it up? Yes or no?

**Wyldcat:**

It's not a stereotype if it's a fact.

&gt; Stereotype: a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing

**Suzerain1:**

why is stereotyping people as racist OK, but stereotyping people as violent or criminal wrong?

Also, people troll that shit all the time, I usually fill out the dumbest answer possible in polls like that, many do.

**Wyldcat:**

Well, haha, what can I say to that? That's just stupid and a waste of everyone's time if you actually do that.

**Suzerain1:**

so its not racist to stereotye blacks for being more criminal you are saying?

**Wyldcat:**

I'm still not sure if you know what ""stereotype"" mean?
If the facts points to that there's a higher criminality rate among black men in the US then those are the facts. It doesn't mean though that the data is racist. It's just data.

What you do with that information can be racist if you judge them based on that to fit your world view that they are violent, savages or less evolved. That's racist.

But if you instead consider the factors that has led to those situations and what the data concluded: social issues, poverty, education, living standards, jobs, racism against them, police violence, drugs etc
Then you might understand why the data points to more crime.

**Suzerain1:**

3x the rate of single parent homes and the culture of having multiple ""baby mommas"" is my guess. I think a higher % of blacks subscribing to hip hop culture is the main reason for the plight of the black community in 2016. Japanese were rounded up and put in camps during WWII but they dont seem to be doing as bad

**Wyldcat:**

Now you see, that's racist. You're literally judging ALL black people thinking they have a culture of multiple ""baby mommas"", listen to hip hop and for some really odd reason you compare them to Japanese interns during WWII.

Where do you live and what made you think like this?

I'm speechless.

**Suzerain1:**

No, I'm judging black people that subscribe to that culture, as well as the white and hispanic and others that do as well. It just so happens that a larger percentage of blacks subscribe to that culture. I am not saying All black people, just the ones that subscribe to that culture. Just like the article you linked was only talking about the # of trump voters that said ""less evolved""

Black children grow up with 1 parent at 3 times the rate as white children. That is a fact. I am not judging all blacks, just the ones that willingly not raise thier children, or committing criminal I never said MOST blacks- just that they do it at higher rates than everybody else.

**Wyldcat:**

You're judging those black people that ""subscribe"" to that culture and other people. That's still racist and stupid.
The article haven't said anything about all trump supporters. They wrote one third of the trump supporters they surveyed. So your logic is all over the place here, using your own stereotypes and prejudices against it.

So what if they grow up with 1 parent? Does that make them something... less than you? Again you're not taking the social context into your argument.


**Suzerain1:**

&gt; and other people.

nah im not tho

&gt;The article haven't said anything about all trump supporters.

Ok so ~1/3rd of black hillary supporters then.... I maybe like 1/5th. I dont know an exact number. Neither do you, about trump supporters and how many of them actually thinks blacks are less evolved.

&gt;So what if they grow up with 1 parent? Does that make them something... less than you?

absolutely not! I grew up in foster care. the number of parents you grow up with is one of the biggest known predictors of success.

**Wyldcat:**

Okay but if we should conclude, what exactly is your point?

And why don't you like hip hop music haha?

**Suzerain1:**

I love hip hop music, especially the violent kind. Huge fan of Terror Squad, Lox, biggie, dipset, em, mostly older stuff from late 90s early 00s, not as much new stuff.

the hip-hop culture I was referring to was living the actual life. I should've described it as gang culture I suppose

I think his main point was that the 650K number isn't accurate. I don't really care about the actual number to be honest and I think people are to focused on that particular thing. Even Eichenwald seems a bit too focused about that now when he's getting defensive on Twitter. If he has more facts about this he should talk about those instead because people are just focusing on if it would fit on a laptop or not.

628,"&gt; Over the course of decades, Donald Trump’s companies have systematically destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, digital records and paper documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders. These tactics—exposed by a Newsweek review of thousands of pages of court filings, judicial orders and affidavits from an array of court cases—have enraged judges, prosecutors, opposing lawyers and the many ordinary citizens entangled in litigation with Trump. In each instance, Trump and entities he controlled also erected numerous hurdles that made lawsuits drag on for years, forcing courtroom opponents to spend huge sums of money in legal fees as they struggled—sometimes in vain—to obtain records.
&gt; 
&gt; This behavior is of particular import given Trump’s frequent condemnations of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for having deleted more than 30,000 emails from a server she used during her time as secretary of state. While Clinton and her lawyers have said all of those emails were personal, Trump has suggested repeatedly on the campaign trail that they were government documents Clinton was trying to hide and that destroying them constituted a crime. The allegation—which the FBI concluded was not supported by any evidence—is a crowd-pleaser at Trump rallies, often greeted by supporters chanting, “Lock her up!”",2016-11-07 02:12:57+00:00,d9p04yw,1.0,t3_5bjj89,1513.0,politics

EDIT 6:

I'm getting a lot of people saying that 650K emails would indeed fit into a laptop. Absolutely it could be possible but that's not really Eichenwald's point. 

He's saying that 650K emails wouldn't fit into that particular laptop that Weiner had. As we don't know the hdd size of it yet it's pretty unnecessary to speculate about this. 

He's also saying that the number of ""650 000"" emails don't have a proper source when it first appeared in the WSJ article, that's why no other media reported on that particular number, not even an anonymous source so it's not even certain that it's an accurate amount of emails.

765,"&gt; Here is how Moscow operates its campaigns: Hackers pilfer information from a variety of organizations both inside and outside Western governments; that is distributed to individuals who feed it into what a source told a European intelligence expert was a “pipeline.” This so-called pipeline can involve multiple steps before hacked information is disclosed through the media or online. For example, that source reported that documents in the United States intended to disrupt the American election are distributed through WikiLeaks. However, there are so many layers of individuals between the hackers and that organization there is a strong possibility that WikiLeaks does not know with certainty the ultimate source of these records; throughout 2016, the site has been posting emails from various Democratic Party organizations that were originally obtained through Russian hacking.

I didn't say it was safe, I said it was ironic that from what it **appears** she wasn't hacked and didn't get intel leaked.

She shouldn't have had the server absolutely. I've said that already to someone else who misinterpreted what I wrote there. 

She could certainly have been attacked by different APT groups but what I'm saying is that there is no proof of it out there on the interwebz about it. Several state actors could have gotten access to it and kept the intel they gathered from it. So for some reason you are again misunderstanding what I meant. 


She didn't brake any law because the FBI didn't think it would hold up as a case in the court of law. But yes it was extremely careless, as they said. It wasn't illegal to have her own set up but it wasn't recommended by the DOJ.

DWS stepped down because of what she said in the emails and because she had treated him unjustly during the race and the DNC felt they needed to be more transparent to bring over Sanders supporters.

I like Clinton because she's been doing this for a long time. She got great experience first as a lawyer, then as FLOTUS, Senator, running a top charity foundation and now she could be President. She's hard as nails and have put up with shit thrown at her by Republicans for 30 years trying to bring her down because she's a hard working woman in a mostly male workplace. 

She's done tons for children and women both in the US and abroad. Sure she's had many moments where I questioned her intensely like when she ""dodged snipers"" in Bosnia and her server use of course. 

But on the other hand after working with this for 30 years of course someone is going to mess up, sometimes badly but she's only human. Working as a politician in the US (and the rest of the world) you're bound to mess up several times over, just look at the all the other candidates and politicians talked about this year. 

Her screw ups haven't shown her be guilty of anything criminal so far so I'm moving on from the email thing and focusing on her policies that she has on her platform and those policies make her the best candidate to be president this year.

&gt; 
&gt; Clinton: ...17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
&gt; 
&gt; Trump: And our country has no idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton: ...agencies.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton: Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...
&gt; 
&gt; Trump: She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
&gt; 
&gt; The words that so shocked the British were “our country has no idea,” and “I doubt it.” All of the NATO allies are sure Russia is behind the hacking. All of America’s intelligence agencies are, too. The foreign intelligence services had been sharing what they knew about this with the Americans, and Trump had been told about it. But he blithely dismissed the conclusion of not only the United States but its allies as well, based on absolutely nothing. Trump had no apparent means of developing his own information to contradict the findings of intelligence agencies around the world. And that he would so aggressively fight to clear Putin and cast aspersions on all Western intelligence agencies, left the British officials slack-jawed.
&gt; 
&gt; “They didn’t know what to think,” says one former British official who has spoken to numerous members of the government about Trump’s comments in that debate. “A lot of people are now trying to connect the dots of all the data [in the intelligence files] to try and understand Trump.... There certainly are a lot of conspiracy theories being bandied about, but no question there is a lot of concern about what’s going on in Trump’s head...and whether we would be able to work with him.”
&gt; 
&gt; Even as Trump was disputing the role played by the Kremlin in the hacking, his campaign was scouring sites publicly identified by American intelligence as sources for Russian propaganda. Ten days before the third debate, Newsweek published an article disclosing that a document altered by Russian propagandists and put out on the internet—ultimately published by Sputnik—had been cited by Trump at a rally as fact. (The information distributed on the internet placed words that had appeared in Newsweek into the mouth of Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton confidante. Taken in that context, they suggested that her closest allies believed she bore responsibility for the attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya.)
&gt; 
&gt; Subsequently, Sputnik, which took down that article, published another one essentially denying the news organization was controlled by the Kremlin and attacking Newsweek. Before the day was out, the Trump campaign was emailing links to the article from the Russian propaganda site to multiple reporters, urging them to pursue the story.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Officials in Western Europe say they are dismayed that they now feel compelled to gather intelligence on a man who could be the next president of the United States but believe they have no choice. Moscow is seen as a direct threat to their interests—both in its aggressive efforts to reshape global alliances and for its power to damage Western Europe, which obtains almost 40 percent of its natural gas from Russia. Should the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.",2016-11-04 14:14:24+00:00,d9lhf6t,5.0,t1_d9lheco,33.0,politics
833,"&gt; The Kremlin’s campaign is motivated not so much to support Trump as it is to hurt the Democratic nominee. During Clinton’s time as secretary of state, Putin publicly accused her of interfering in Moscow’s affairs. For example, her statement that Russian parliamentary elections in December 2011—which involved blatant cheating—were “neither free nor fair” infuriated Putin. He was also encouraged by the relentlessly positive comments about him by Trump, even after the Republican nominee began receiving criticism within his own party for sounding too supportive of the Kremlin, according to information obtained from within Russia by a Western intelligence source.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Trump and Clinton were monitored by Russian intelligence during their visits to Moscow over the years, according to American and European intelligence sources, in hopes of gathering kompromat—compromising material about a politician or public figure. The dossier on Clinton mainly contains recordings of conversations and intercepted phone calls; the intelligence source said the dossier has been controlled by Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. When she was secretary of state, however, Clinton knew her conversations in Moscow might be recorded, so the dossier appears to have been used mainly for intelligence rather than to embarrass her with allies, the source said. The Kremlin also has both video and audio recordings of Trump in a kompromat file. Newsweek could not confirm if there is anything compromising in those recordings.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This massive Russian campaign has led to significant disputes within the Kremlin. Russian officials originally believed it could be conducted without any significant blowback from the United States. According to information obtained by the Western intelligence source, Sergei Ivanov, the chief of staff for the presidential executive office in the Kremlin, came to believe this summer that the hacking and disinformation campaign, which has been orchestrated in part by Peskov, had gone too far. Articles implying that Russian had been trying to split the supporters of Democratic primary runner-up Bernie Sanders and Clinton while building up Trump set off fears among Peskov and others that they would be held responsible for the backlash from the United States, according to the information obtained by the Western intelligence source.
&gt; 
&gt; Ivanov was also furious that Peskov led what he considered to be an ill-conceived and botched attempt to use the hacking and disinformation campaign to interfere in the failed coup attempt in Turkey in July. The web of relationships involving Turkey, Western Europe, the United States, Syria and Trump is complex, and Ivanov expressed disbelief that an attempt to interfere with the coup was undertaken without examining the possible ramifications. The Incirlik air base in Turkey has been used as a primary staging area for American bombers engaged in attacks on the Islamic State group in both Syria and Iraq; Russia supports President Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president who is fighting off a variety of rebel outfits, including ISIS, which has led the Kremlin to authorize bombing campaigns there. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan despises Trump and his associates because of the Republican nominee’s anti-Muslim rhetoric (in March, one of Trump’s Turkish business partners was indicted in what some Erdogan critics described as retribution). Erdogan has told associates he will not cooperate militarily with a Trump administration, according to a Middle Eastern financier in direct contact with senior Turkish officials.
&gt; 
&gt; By interfering in the Turkish coup with propaganda efforts, one faction in the Kremlin believes Moscow might have squandered the advantages to be gained from Erdogan’s contempt for Trump, according to both European and Middle Eastern intelligence sources. If Erdogan is angry at the next American president, the ability of the United States to engage in military action in Syria would be severely limited. If Russian interference in the coup leads Erdogan to turn his fury on Moscow, the Americans might maintain access to the air base.
&gt; 
&gt; Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, is also deeply concerned about the cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, according to information obtained by a Western intelligence source. He wants to maintain a close relationship with the United States so he can travel to America both officially and privately. As a result, he is refusing to support Peskov or to strongly combat U.S. charges about the hacking campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite these qualms, Putin remained satisfied with the campaign, regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election, according to information obtained by the Western intelligence source. Should Clinton win, he has told associates, her administration would be bogged down trying to heal divisions within the United States brought about by releases and misrepresentations of hacked information, and would have little time or political capital to confront Russia’s efforts in Syria, Ukraine and other locales.
&gt; 
&gt; By August, however, fears began to emerge within the Kremlin that the effort was falling apart. Trump’s attacks on the parents of a slain Muslim American soldier following the father’s speech at the Democratic convention created dismay in the Kremlin. Top Russian officials came to believe Trump would be forced to withdraw from the race because of his psychological state and apparent unsuitability for the presidency, according to information obtained by the Western intelligence source. In particular, Kremlin officials feared they could not predict what impact it might have on Russia should Trump step aside. As a result, the Russians decided to stop forwarding material through channels to WikiLeaks, although some material was already in the pipeline. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ivanov expressed his belief that, while the United States has failed to split the Russian elite with sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, the cyberattacks had created political division in the United States. Still, he had strong concerns about the impact of continuing the campaign in the aftermath of Trump’s attack on the parents who had lost a child in war. By that time, though, the internal controversy over the cyberattacks and disinformation campaign had taken its toll, and a decision was reached to “sweep it all under the rug,” according to a report obtained by Western counterintelligence officials. On August 12, Ivanov—a close ally of Putin for decades—was forced out of office by the Russian strongman and replaced by Anton Vaino, who had been the deputy chief of staff.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Two days later, The New York Times reported that Manafort, then Trump’s campaign manager, may have illegally received $12.7 million from Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions; Manafort has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer, Richard Hibey, said his client never received any such payments. Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign not long after the article ran. According to information obtained from inside Russia by Western intelligence, Putin later met with Yanukovych in secret near Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad. Yanukovych assured Putin there was no documentary trail showing payments to Manafort, although Putin told associates he did not believe the Ukrainian president, according to the information obtained by the Western intelligence source.
&gt; 
&gt; By October, “buyer’s remorse” had set in at the Kremlin, according to a report obtained by Western counterintelligence. Russia came to see Trump as too unpredictable and feared that, should he win, the Kremlin would not be able to rely on him or even anticipate his actions.
&gt; 
&gt; On October 7, the Obama administration finally broke its silence on America’s knowledge about the Russian campaign. “These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,” Jeh Johnson, the secretary of homeland security, and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, said in a statement. “We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.” The White House stated that Obama was considering a “proportional response”—a statement that suggested the United States would be launching cyberattacks against Russia. (Shortly afterward, Ukrainian hackers began posting emails and other documents obtained from inside the Kremlin, although it is not clear if this effort was done in coordination with the American government.)
&gt; 
&gt; Less than two weeks later—despite his intelligence briefings about the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign, despite the public statements by top American intelligence officials confirming its existence and despite the White House proclamation that it was preparing to respond to the unprecedented interference by Moscow—Trump once again dismissed all of the evidence and came to Russia’s defense. Intelligence and other government officials in Britain were horrified, according to one person with direct knowledge of the reaction there. 
&gt; 
&gt; The incident that so stunned the British officials was largely overlooked in the United States, where media analysts were more focused on Trump’s refusal to say whether he would accept the outcome of the election. Instead, it came in the course of a discussion during the third presidential debate, when the two candidates talked about the Russian hacking.

834,"Sure: Here's the entire article, split into 3 parts:

&gt; In phone calls, meetings and cables, America’s European allies have expressed alarm to one another about Donald Trump’s public statements denying Moscow’s role in cyberattacks designed to interfere with the U.S. election. They fear the Republican nominee for president has emboldened the Kremlin in its unprecedented cybercampaign to disrupt elections in multiple countries in hopes of weakening Western alliances, according to intelligence, law enforcement and other government officials in the United States and Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; While American intelligence officers have privately briefed Trump about Russia’s attempts to influence the U.S. election, he has publicly dismissed that information as unreliable, instead saying this hacking of incredible sophistication and technical complexity could have been done by some 400-pound “guy sitting on their bed” or even a child.

&gt; 
&gt; Officials from two European countries tell Newsweek that Trump’s comments about Russia’s hacking have alarmed several NATO partners because it suggests he either does not believe the information he receives in intelligence briefings, does not pay attention to it, does not understand it or is misleading the American public for unknown reasons. One British official says members of that government who are aware of the scope of Russia’s cyberattacks both in Western Europe and America found Trump’s comments “quite disturbing” because they fear that, if elected, the Republican presidential nominee would continue to ignore information gathered by intelligence services in the formulation of U.S. foreign policy.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump’s behavior, however, has at times concerned the Russians, leading them to revise their hacking and disinformation strategy. For example, when Trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race. As a result, Moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold, ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized, both personally and in the polls, according to reports provided to Western intelligence.
&gt; 
&gt; America’s European partners are also troubled by the actions of several people close to Trump’s campaign and company. Trump has been surrounded by advisers and associates with economic and familial links to Russia. The publicized connections and contacts between former campaign manager Paul Manafort with Ukraine have raised concerns. Former Trump adviser Carter Page is being probed by American and European intelligence on allegations that he engaged in back-channel discussions with Russian government officials over the summer. Page did travel to Moscow, but he denies any inappropriate contact with Russian officials. The allies are also uneasy about retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser who was reportedly considered a possible running mate for the GOP nominee. Last December, Flynn attended a dinner at the Metropol Hotel in honor of the 10th anniversary of RT, a Russian news agency that has been publicly identified by American intelligence as a primary outlet for Moscow’s disinformation campaigns. Flynn, who was two seats away from Russian President Vladimir Putin at the dinner, has frequently appeared on RT, despite public warnings by American intelligence that the news agency is used for Russian propaganda.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Western intelligence has also obtained reports that a Trump associate met with a pro-Putin member of Russian parliament at a building in Eastern Europe maintained by Rossotrudnichestvo, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that is charged with administering language, education and support programs for civilians. While the purpose of that meeting is unclear, and there is no evidence that Trump was aware it took place, it has become another fact that has alarmed officials from at least one NATO ally. Finally, Trump’s repeated glowing statements about Putin throughout the campaign—and his shocking comment that the Russians were not in Crimea—have perplexed some foreign officials, who fear that under a Trump presidency, the United States would no longer stand with Western Europe in regard to Moscow.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump and his campaign have also spread propaganda created as part of the Kremlin's effort, relying on bogus information generated through traditional Russian disinformation techniques. In one instance, a manipulated document was put out onto the internet anonymously by propagandists working with Russia; within hours, Trump was reciting that false information at a campaign rally. The Trump campaign has also spread claims from Sputnik, another news outlet identified by American intelligence as part of the Russian disinformation campaign. For example, almost immediately after the posting of an article by Sputnik attacking this Newsweek reporter, the Trump campaign emailed a link to the piece to American reporters, urging them to pursue the same story.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, did not respond to emails from Newsweek on Monday and Thursday asking how it became aware of the Sputnik story so quickly, why it almost immediately promoted information from the Russian propaganda site to U.S. reporters, and what led the Republican nominee to disregard the intelligence he has been provided in briefings about Moscow’s propaganda and hacking campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; American intelligence officials know Russia used cyberattacks and misinformation to interfere with recent elections in Western Europe, including the German elections last month that resulted in victories for right-wing populists, and the United Kingdom’s vote in June on Brexit, a referendum that called for Britain to leave the European Union.
&gt; 
&gt; Western intelligence and law enforcement say tens of thousands of people have been working with Russia on its hacking and disinformation campaign for many years. They include propagandists and cyberoperatives stationed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk, located in the southwestern part of Siberia. Operations have also been conducted in the United States, primarily out of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Those involved include a large number of Russian émigrés, as well as Americans and other foreign nationals. Intelligence operations in Europe and the U.S. have determined that the money these émigrés receive for their work is disguised as payments from a Russian pension system. One U.S. official says there is evidence many of these Americans and foreign nationals do not know they are part of Russia’s propaganda operation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Here is how Moscow operates its campaigns: Hackers pilfer information from a variety of organizations both inside and outside Western governments; that is distributed to individuals who feed it into what a source told a European intelligence expert was a “pipeline.” This so-called pipeline can involve multiple steps before hacked information is disclosed through the media or online. For example, that source reported that documents in the United States intended to disrupt the American election are distributed through WikiLeaks. However, there are so many layers of individuals between the hackers and that organization there is a strong possibility that WikiLeaks does not know with certainty the ultimate source of these records; throughout 2016, the site has been posting emails from various Democratic Party organizations that were originally obtained through Russian hacking.
&gt; 
&gt; The Russian penetration in the United States is far more extensive than previously revealed publicly, although most of it has been targeted either at government departments or nongovernment organizations connected to the Democratic Party. Russian hackers penetrated the White House, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department. The State Department cyberattack, which began in 2014 and lasted more than a year, was particularly severe, with Russian hackers gaining entry into its unclassified system, including emails. (Hillary Clinton left the State Department in 2013, which means that if she had used its unclassified email system rather than her private server—a decision that has dogged her throughout the campaign—any of her emails on the government system could have been obtained by Russian hackers.)
&gt; 
&gt; The breadth of the cyberattacks of nongovernmental organizations is astonishing. Russian hackers have obtained emails and other information out of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, but also have struck at organizations with looser ties to the party, including think tanks such as the Brookings Institution, where some of Clinton’s longtime friends and colleagues work.
&gt; 
&gt; Once the documents are obtained by hackers and then distributed, a large group of propagandists around the world begin promoting them on social media—in comments sections of websites and other locations online—hoping to generate negative news stories that undermine Democratic officials, particularly Clinton.",2016-11-04 14:13:24+00:00,d9lhdo1,3.0,t1_d9lgegg,1416.0,politics

880,"Because that would never have passed Congress with Republicans as the majority, they barely passed Obamacare remember? So apparently (because of the GOP) you need to change things slowly step by step. 

But also, he's been for a Public Option, which is like a mix between single-payer and ACA:

&gt; [ObamaCare](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-and-the-public-option/) allows for a public option, a public health insurance plan that can compete with private companies and works with the ACA. This “ObamaCare public option” can work a few ways.
&gt; 
&gt; President Obama previously expressed support for a national public option and suggested that states create state-based public options via sec. 1332 waivers, especially in regions with low competition. Initially it looked like only state-based options would fly, but recent action in the Senate and additional support from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, means that a national public option could be on the table too (if Democrats can get an ungutted bill by the Republican controlled Congress).

&gt; A public option is simply a public health insurance agency, typically a government-run agency, that can compete with the private insurers. This is sort of a half-way point between single payer and the pre-ACA private market. Almost how original Medicare is public and supplemental Medicare is private, except the public option is a full health plan and supplemental likely wouldn’t be needed.
&gt; 
It's fine if you don't want to debate more, I understand it's been a long year but I will say one thing that I'm 100% certain of and that is a Trump presidency would be several steps back for the US on all the issues I listed but also a danger to the entire world, both economically and foreign policy.

911,"&gt; Low gas prices and President Barack Obama's high approval ratings are key factors that favor Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the White House in next week's election, according to a model from Moody's Analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine U.S. presidential contests.
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton is forecast to pick up 332 Electoral College votes against 206 for Republican Donald Trump, Moody's Analytics predicted on Tuesday in the final update of its model before Election Day on Nov. 8. That would match Obama's margin of victory over Republican challenger Mitt Romney in 2012.
&gt; 
&gt; The Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project also predicts a Clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president.
&gt; 
&gt; The Moody's Analytics model is based on a combination of state-level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since Republican Ronald Reagan unseated Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rather than focus on the individual candidates in a race, the model instead centers on whether current economic and political conditions favor the incumbent party in the White House. This year those factors point to Clinton becoming the 45th U.S. president**.
&gt; 
&gt; The economic factors Moody's measures include the two-year percentage changes in real personal income per household, as well as house and gasoline prices.
&gt; 
&gt; Among the political factors weighed, Moody's said the most important is the share of the vote in any one state that went to the incumbent party in the previous election. It also takes into account voter fatigue and the incumbent president's approval ratings.
&gt; 
&gt; This year, with Obama enjoying some of his highest job approval ratings since his first year in office in 2009 and gasoline prices holding steady at well-below-average levels, the model suggests the Democrats will win their third straight presidential election, Moody's said. That would mark the first time since the 1988 election of Republican George H.W. Bush that one party has won three consecutive presidential contests.
&gt; 
&gt; Moody's warns, however, that its model does not take into account any individual characteristics of specific candidates.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Given the unusual nature of the 2016 election cycle to date, it is very possible that voters will react to changing economic and political conditions differently than they have in past election cycles, placing some risk in the model outcome, particularly state-by-state projections,"" Moody's analytics economist Dan White wrote in the report.

945,"&gt; This year, the German public television network ZDF produced a documentary **tracing the ideological and financial ties between Russia and extreme right-wing elements**; among those elements was Elsässer. His own blogs show an over-the-top enthusiasm for the Russian regime, such as comparing Putin’s bombing of Aleppo with the Russian defense of Stalingrad. Whatever the realities of the situation in Syria, Russian intervention in the conflict hardly merits comparison with the decisive turning point of the Second World War.
&gt; 
&gt; There were other suggestions of Russian fingerprints on Elsässer’s magazine. It was printed on coated stock, with lots of photos and fairly high production values. Fringe parties generally can’t afford the production costs of this sort of thing—unless they are getting a bit of financial help. The editorial tone was a kind of unholy marriage between Breitbart.com and the Russian-funded website Sputnik, with a little Völkischer Beobachter thrown in for good measure (there was generous use of the term “Lügenpresse”—the lying press, a term popularized by the Nazis.) More to the point, it was written in the breathless, apocalyptic manner of the Soviet anti-NATO propaganda I used to see as a national-security analyst in Congress in the 1980s—with one exception.

&gt; Classic Soviet propaganda always treated Democrats and Republicans as essentially indistinguishable and interchangeable components of the bourgeois power structure, both equally worthy of denunciation. **Compact, however, had several articles explicitly endorsing Donald J. Trump as an all-around swell guy, with one explaining how a President Trump would improve U.S. relations with Russia**.
&gt;___

&gt;There is a fascinating historical parallel here: Throughout the Cold War, Moscow subsidized the leftist fringe in Western Europe. Now it does the same with right-wing parties there—same tactics, different ideological players.

&gt; The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasn’t the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversation—conversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasn’t an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank.

&gt; Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie. In the world of DNS experts, there’s no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, “The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.” Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence. Over the summer, the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance.“It’s the interpacket gap, the spacing between the conversations, the total volume. If you look at those time stamps, they are not simulated. This bears every indication that it was collected from a live link.”

&gt; F.B.I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 “look-up” messages — a first step for one system’s computers to talk to another — to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. But the F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.

Why the hell would a bank send 2,700 marketing emails/spam to Trump's server? It also uses the words ""concluded that there **could be** an innocuous explanation"" which doesn't really rule out that it could be something else as well.

&gt; On Wednesday, however, Trump found himself among a roomful of policy wonks when he delivered his first major foreign policy address at the Mayflower Hotel under the auspices of a Washington establishment think tank: **the Center for the National Interest**. 
&gt; ____

&gt; That Trump would choose the Center for the National Interest as the place to premier his new seriousness **on foreign policy has Manafort’s fingerprints all over it**. For Manafort and the Center have something very important in common: **both have ties to the Russian regime of President Vladimir Putin, (whose ambassador to the United States sat in the front row for Trump’s address)**.
&gt; ____
&gt; As for **the Center, both it and its journal, the National Interest, are two of the most Kremlin-sympathetic institutions in the nation’s capital**, even more so that the Carnegie Moscow Center,
&gt; _____
&gt; **For years, the Center for the National Interest partnered with the Russian government-funded Institute for Democracy and Cooperation**, a New York-based institution whose head, Adranik Migranyan, was **personally appointed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov**, according to a State Department cable released by Wikileaks. In May 2014, **the two think tanks held a press conference defending Russia’s position in Ukraine**.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Another association connecting Trump to the Center is **Richard Burt**, **chairman of the National Interest’s advisory council,** and a former ambassador to Germany and State Department official during the Reagan administration. According to a knowledgeable source, Burt, who had previously worked as an unpaid advisor to former Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, **has been enlisted by Manafort to join Trump’s campaign and helped draft his speech** (neither Burt nor Manafort responded to inquiries). **Burt sits on the senior advisory board of the** **Russian Alfa Bank**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; **Burt also expressed skepticism about the relevance of NATO, another Trump talking point**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; [Burt] spoke favorably of Trump’s “America First” policy (a term that Trump explicitly used in his speech Wednesday, declaring that it “will be the major and overriding theme of my administration”) and expressed agreement with the candidate’s comments on America’s allies posing a “free rider problem.” (Perhaps blowing a kiss at Trump, on April 14 the Center hosted a panel discussion with Burt and University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer entitled, **“Does America Need Allies?”**)

General Flynn, Boris Epschteyn, Howard Lorber, Richard Burt.

&gt; On Wednesday, however, Trump found himself among a roomful of policy wonks when he delivered his first major foreign policy address at the Mayflower Hotel under the auspices of a Washington establishment think tank: **the Center for the National Interest**. 
&gt; ____

&gt; That Trump would choose the Center for the National Interest as the place to premier his new seriousness **on foreign policy has Manafort’s fingerprints all over it**. For Manafort and the Center have something very important in common: **both have ties to the Russian regime of President Vladimir Putin, (whose ambassador to the United States sat in the front row for Trump’s address)**.
&gt; ____
&gt; As for **the Center, both it and its journal, the National Interest, are two of the most Kremlin-sympathetic institutions in the nation’s capital**, even more so that the Carnegie Moscow Center,
&gt; _____
&gt; **For years, the Center for the National Interest partnered with the Russian government-funded Institute for Democracy and Cooperation**, a New York-based institution whose head, Adranik Migranyan, was** personally appointed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,** according to a State Department cable released by Wikileaks. In May 2014, **the two think tanks held a press conference defending Russia’s position in Ukraine**.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Another association connecting Trump to the Center is **Richard Burt**, **chairman of the National Interest’s advisory council,** and a former ambassador to Germany and State Department official during the Reagan administration. According to a knowledgeable source, Burt, who had previously worked as an unpaid advisor to former Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, **has been enlisted by Manafort to join Trump’s campaign and helped draft his speech** (neither Burt nor Manafort responded to inquiries). **Burt sits on the senior advisory board of the** **Russian Alfa Bank**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; **Burt also expressed skepticism about the relevance of NATO, another Trump talking point**.
&gt; _____
&gt; 
&gt; [Burt] spoke favorably of Trump’s “America First” policy (a term that Trump explicitly used in his speech Wednesday, declaring that it “will be the major and overriding theme of my administration”) and expressed agreement with the candidate’s comments on America’s allies posing a “free rider problem.” (Perhaps blowing a kiss at Trump, on April 14 the Center hosted a panel discussion with Burt and University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer entitled, **“Does America Need Allies?”**)

&gt; 
&gt; ""The email server, set up for marketing purposes and operated by a third-party, has not been used since 2010.  **The current traffic on the server from Alphabank's [sic] IP address is regular DNS server traffic—not email traffic**.  To be clear, The Trump Organization is not sending or receiving any communications from this email server. The Trump Organization has no communication or relationship with this entity or any Russian entity""
&gt; 
&gt; I asked Hicks to explain what caused the Trump Organization to rename its host after the New York Times called Alfa. I also asked how the Trump Organization arrived at its judgment that there was no e-mail traffic. (**Furthermore, there’s no such thing as “regular” DNS server traffic, at least not according to the computer scientists I consulted. The very reason DNS exists is to enable e-mail and other means of communication**.) She never provided me with a response.
&gt; 
&gt; What the scientists amassed wasn’t isn’t a smoking gun. It’s a suggestive body of evidence that doesn’t absolutely preclude alternative explanations. But this evidence arrives in the broader context of the campaign and everything else that has come to light: The efforts of Donald Trump’s former campaign manager to bring Ukraine into Vladimir Putin’s orbit; the other Trump advisor whose communications with senior Russian officials have worried intelligence officials; the Russian hacking of the DNC and John Podesta’s email.

&gt; Comey's disclosure of the emails ignited fierce criticism, particularly from Clinton, who called the move an ""unprecedented"" departure from FBI policy.
&gt; 
&gt; On Sunday, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid scolded Comey as well, saying in a letter that he ""demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another.""
&gt; 
&gt; Reid added that his office determined that Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which bars government officials from using their authority to influence elections.
&gt; 
&gt; The FBI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Reid letter.

* FBI agents knew of these emails a month ago but didn't tell Comey about them until last Thursday.

* Comey decides he should acknowledge these new findings to Congress by writing an extremely vague letter to them ([despite the DOJ advising him not to do that](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/30/robby-mook/clinton-campaign-says-comey-letter-violates-justic/)).

* Chaffetz (who re-endorsed Trump on Wednesday the 26th, the day before the FBI agents briefed Comey about the new emails) ~~and other Republicans received them first and~~ decides to tweet about it making it into a news story on Friday afternoon.

* Comey writes in the letter that they don't know any details about these emails but that they could be important to the investigation.

* Trump goes on a lying spree and makes up all kinds of bullshit to use the situation to his advantage.

* News comes out that the emails might not involve Clinton at all but her aide Huma Abedin.

* News gets out that the FBI hasn't even looked at the emails.

* More news gets out that the FBI hasn't even requested a search warrant to read the emails (which should've been step 1).

* [The FBI now has the warrant](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-obtains-warrant-needed-start-reviewing-emails-found/story?id=43179164).

3) The FBI, while investigating Weiner, noticed that many emails on his computer located in an  account belonging to Huma Abedin. 

The next day without the proper warrant and no time for investigators to check the emails he decides that he needs to update Congress on the current situation so he sends the letter because he wanted to be transparent to them as he had earlier told them that the investigation was completed. 

Chaffetz receives the letter first and decides to go to twitter to post it. 

No matter what you think about Comey's decision to even make that letter I think this is what happened.

&gt;[Wicker pushes Carter and Dunford about a enforcing a no-fly zone in Syria but calling it by a different name \(""more palatable terms""\). Carter stammers while giving his answer.

[Gen Dunford said last year that they are considering all options to find the best solutions and that a no-fly zone was one of the options that could work](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/11/13/joseph-dunford-chairman-joint-chiefs-staff-warns-generational-struggle-against-terrorism/gFMAJ8R2IbrLxD0TESL4AO/story.html). The situation has obviously changed from last year and is even more complicated now that [Russia has put a anti-aircraft missile defense systems in Syria which could threaten US and coalition airforces](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/25/intelligence-director-wouldnt-put-it-past-russia-to-fire-at-u-s-aircraft-in-syria/). 

John Kerry is also for a no-fly zone because it could save a lot of lives IF Russia would stand down and play by the book and stop bombing the shit out of hospitals, UN convoys, kids and families etc so coalition forces could carry out missions against ISIS or help rebel groups. 

If they wouldn't be willing to stand down I doubt anyone would enforce a no-fly zone considering the consequences.

&gt; In the past, Clinton has called for “safe zones” and “no-fly zones” in Syria. During the third presidential debate last week, moderator Chris Wallace asked Clinton whether she would fire on Russian aircraft that were violating a U.S.-imposed no-fly zone. She did not answer the question, [saying only that a no-fly zone “would take a lot of negotiation,” and that she thinks she could “strike a deal” where Russian planes would avoid no-fly zones](https://theintercept.com/2016/10/25/intelligence-director-wouldnt-put-it-past-russia-to-fire-at-u-s-aircraft-in-syria/). 
______

More info from Dunford and Kerry shows that this situation is very complicated:

&gt; This view was reiterated Thursday by General Dunford, who declared that based on the “combination of their behavior and their military capability, Russia is the most significant threat to our national interests.” Asked if he supported the proposal for intelligence sharing, Dunford responded, “We don’t have any intention of having an intelligence-sharing arrangement with the Russians.”
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking in New York Thursday night after the so-called International Syria Support Group ended a meeting with no progress toward restoring the US-Russian ceasefire agreement, Secretary of State Kerry declared: “The only way to achieve that [cessation of hostilities and violence] is if the ones who have the air power in this part of the conflict simply stop using it—not for one day or two, but for as long as possible so that everyone can see that they are serious.”

&gt; The imposition of a no-fly zone over Aleppo and other Al Nusra-controlled areas is increasingly seen as a life and death matter for the US-backed Islamists. As Thursday’s Senate hearing indicated, while Kerry is appealing to Russia to voluntarily stand down, there are significant elements within the US state that are calling for the imposition of the no-fly zone by force.

And don't think that Clinton or Democrats are the only ones wondering about a no-fly zone:


&gt; 
&gt; **Gen. Dunford was asked by Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker if the US could take “decisive action” in imposing a no-fly zone**. Wicker indicated that he had discussed the matter with Democrats, who indicated that they would support such a venture if the US intervention were given another name.

Same-sex unions:

&gt; December 1999: Clinton told a group of gay contributors at a fundraiser that she was against the ""don't ask, don't tell"" military policy signed by her husband.
&gt; 
&gt; The New York Times reported that Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act but added that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets.""

&gt; 
&gt; October 2006: Clinton told a group of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I support states making the decision,"" she said
&gt; 
&gt; August 2007: In a Democratic primary debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and LOGO Network (a gay-oriented TV station) Clinton was asked ""What is at the heart of your opposition to same-sex marriage?""
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton replied: ""Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it’s a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we’re having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges.""

I highly doubt she actually had anything against people who were of the same sex and wanted to marry, but to her maybe ""marriage"" was something a man and a woman did in a Christian church, as she is Christian and is raised in those traditions. As the country got more liberal her views changed. When she was a senator she fought for legislations to address hate crimes and ""*...fought for federal non-discrimination legislation to protect LGBT Americans in the workplace, and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked LGBT Americans from adopting children*"".

Obama was against same sex marriage in 2008, but was for it a while before and of course after. So apparently it's not that strange considering how much of a hot topic this used to be in the US especially when it comes to politics. 

Now she's for it so does it really matter that she was only partly-pro same-sex marriage 20 years ago? The Democrats platform is the most progressive platform ever and it's strong on LGBTQ issues. What's not to like about that?

If she would be against same sex-marriage in privat (for some odd reason) but swears to uphold the right for same-sex marriage and equality because that's the party platform, even then should would have my support.

[Ukraine is regarded to have good relations with the US:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93United_States_relations)

&gt; The United States enjoys cordially friendly and strategic relations with Ukraine and attaches great importance to the success of Ukraine's transition to a democratic state with a flourishing market economy. The United States supports Ukraine’s bid to join NATO despite Russia’s objections. 


&gt;[U.S.-UKRAINE RELATIONS](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3211.htm)

&gt; It also emphasizes the continued commitment of the United States to support enhanced engagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine. To fulfill one of the key tenets of the charter, the two countries have established the Strategic Partnership Commission.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Assistance to Ukraine
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. Government assistance to Ukraine aims to support the development of a democratic, prosperous, and secure Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. A fact sheet on U.S. assistance to Ukraine can be found here.

So as soon as they join NATO they are officially a US ally.

&gt; Why do we need to have proxy wars and waste our resources on geopolitical issues that have no relevance to our or our allies?

NATO countries are allies of the US, NATO countries and Scandinavian countries are in danger of Russian expansion and intrusions as are other European countries (more allies). The US is also backing SA partly because they are seen as the gatekeepers in ME against a bigger threat partly by Iran and ISIS, see war in Yemen as an example as well.

Okay this is awkward, did you even read your own source? They write that the Trumps do indeed have business in Russia, according to **Donald Trump Jr**:

&gt; The statement from Trump press secretary Hope Hicks did not address questions about Russian money in the real estate mogul’s businesses in the United States or elsewhere outside Russia. His son Donald Jr. said eight years ago that Russian investors had put plenty of money into the family’s enterprises.
&gt; 
&gt; “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Donald Trump Jr. said at a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication, cited by The Washington Post. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”


And from[ Time](http://time.com/4433880/donald-trump-ties-to-russia/), which is also ""pretty reliable"" wrote:

&gt; The truth, as several columnists and reporters have painstakingly shown since the first hack of a Clinton-affiliated group took place in late May or early June, is that several of Trump’s businesses outside of Russia are entangled with Russian financiers inside Putin’s circle.
&gt; 
&gt; So, yes, it’s true that Trump has failed to land a business venture inside Russia. But the real truth is that, as major banks in America stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies, the Trump organization was forced to seek financing from non-traditional institutions. Several had direct ties to Russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows. What’s more, several of Trump’s senior advisors have business ties to Russia or its satellite politicians.
&gt; 
&gt; “The Trump-Russia links beneath the surface are even more extensive,” Max Boot wrote in the Los Angeles Times. “Trump has sought and received funding from Russian investors for his business ventures, especially after most American banks stopped lending to him following his multiple bankruptcies.”
&gt; 
&gt; What’s more, three of Trump’s top advisors all have extensive financial and business ties to Russian financiers, wrote Boot, the former editor of the Op Ed page of the Wall Street Journal and now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

If your so called friends are all accomplished business people they would know that does business in Russia. If that wouldn't be enough for you and your accomplished friends there's this article from [TPM](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trump-putin-yes-it-s-really-a-thing) as well:

&gt; Let's start with the basic facts. There is a lot of Russian money flowing into Trump's coffers and he is conspicuously solicitous of Russian foreign policy priorities.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll list off some facts.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. All the other discussions of Trump's finances aside, his debt load has grown dramatically over the last year, from $350 million to $630 million. This is in just one year while his liquid assets have also decreased. Trump has been blackballed by all major US banks.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Post-bankruptcy Trump has been highly reliant on money from Russia, most of which has over the years become increasingly concentrated among oligarchs and sub-garchs close to Vladimir Putin. Here's a good overview from The Washington Post, with one morsel for illustration ...
&gt; Since the 1980s, Trump and his family members have made numerous trips to Moscow in search of business opportunities, and they have relied on Russian investors to buy their properties around the world.
&gt; “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Trump’s son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008, according to an account posted on the website of eTurboNews, a trade publication. “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”

&gt; 3. One example of this is the Trump Soho development in Manhattan, one of Trump's largest recent endeavors. The project was the hit with a series of lawsuits in response to some typically Trumpian efforts to defraud investors by making fraudulent claims about the financial health of the project. Emerging out of that litigation however was news about secret financing for the project from Russia and Kazakhstan. Most attention about the project has focused on the presence of a twice imprisoned Russian immigrant with extensive ties to the Russian criminal underworld. But that's not the most salient part of the story. As the Times put it,
&gt; 
&gt; ""Mr. Lauria brokered a $50 million investment in Trump SoHo and three other Bayrock projects by an Icelandic firm preferred by wealthy Russians “in favor with” President Vladimir V. Putin, according to a lawsuit against Bayrock by one of its former executives. The Icelandic company, FL Group, was identified in a Bayrock investor presentation as a “strategic partner,” along with Alexander Mashkevich, a billionaire once charged in a corruption case involving fees paid by a Belgian company seeking business in Kazakhstan; that case was settled with no admission of guilt.""
&gt; Another suit alleged the project ""occasionally received unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in Kazakhstan and Russia.""

Maybe you should inform your friends that Mike Pence wants to ""help""  them with this thing called Conversion Therapy, repeal their rights to marry and condones discrimination against them. Don't forget how he works against women's health issues as well so you could pass that on to that girl. Trump himself are against LGBTQ rights in his own country, what does that make him? Clinton are for all of your friends rights to be treated equal. 

Then you could tell them that Trump's bff Putin routinely discriminates against people who are gay, condones homophobia and hatecrimes against them. 

&gt; In the 21st century, Russia began to receive worldwide attention for their legal treatment of LGBT citizens, which has been referred to as one of the worst human rights violations in the post-Soviet era. 

&gt; Since 2006, numerous regions in Russia have enacted varying laws restricting the distribution of materials promoting LGBT relationships to minors; in June 2013, a federal law criminalizing the distribution of materials among minors in support of ""non-traditional"" sexual relationships, was enacted as an amendment to an existing child protection law. The law has resulted in the numerous arrests of Russian LGBT citizens publicly opposing the law and there has reportedly been a surge of homophobic propaganda, violence, and even hate crimes, many of whom use the law as justification.

&gt; It has received international criticism from human rights observers, LGBT activists, and media outlets and has been viewed as de facto means of criminalizing LGBT culture. Russian historian and human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva has called it ""a step toward the Middle Ages.""

&gt;Same-sex marriage: Neither same-sex marriages nor civil unions of same-sex couples are allowed in Russia

&gt;A Russian motorcycle club called the Night Wolves, which is closely associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin and which suggests ""Death to faggots"" as an alternate name for itself,[14] organized a large Anti-Maidan rally in February 2015 at which a popular slogan was ""We don't need Western ideology and gay parades!""[15]

85% of the Russian people are against same sex marriage.

1126,"&gt; **The 2016 Republican party platform has been criticized as the “most anti-LGBT” in history**. **It condemns the 2015 court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. It also advocates for conversion therapy** ― a practice that’s meant to change an LGBT person’s gender or sexual orientation to fit heteronormative expectations and has been condemned by every mainstream mental health and medical association in the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout Trump’s campaign, he has vocalized support toward the queer community. After the tragic mass shooting in June at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Trump said in his convention speech that he “will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.”
&gt; 
&gt; But those promised claims conflict with statements he’s made that he would walk back numerous protections the federal government has put in place to defend gender identity and sexual orientation. **Trump has said he opposes same-sex marriage and would “strongly consider” appointing judges to overturn the historic marriage equality legislation passed last year. In 2011, Trump compared his stance on same-sex marriage to his dislike of extra long golf putters**. 
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to the transgender community, Trump’s comments have flip-flopped. **He initially spoke out against North Carolina’s anti-LGBT bathroom bill passed earlier this year but later said the state had the right to enact it**. He also wants to rescind the Department of Education’s guidance to allow transgender kids to use the school bathroom of their choice.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has been publicly anti-LGBT for years. Most recently, he made headlines last year when he signed the Religions Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which allowed businesses to legally discriminate against LGBTQ people on the basis of religious beliefs**.
&gt; 
&gt; After widespread uproar from businesses in his state who condemned the bill, Pence amended the law to include protections for gender identity and sexual orientation. But LGBTQ people are still left vulnerable in Indiana ― and numerous other states ― where protective legislation in housing, healthcare and more varies.
&gt; 
&gt; Even Log Cabin Republicans (LCR), the conservative LGBTQ political group, announced earlier this week they would not endorse Trump. LCR initially lauded him for being accepting toward queer people, but they’ve since retracted their support. A written statement by the group reads: 
&gt; 
&gt; “Should Mr. Trump become our nation’s next president, Log Cabin Republicans welcomes the opportunity to work with his administration. Until and unless that happens, our trust would be misplaced.”
&gt; 
&gt; **These are just a few examples of the discriminatory rhetoric Trump and Pence have spewed against the LGBTQ community. In June, Trump had a private event with vehemently anti-gay bigots and he’s pledged to sign the “First Amendment Defense Act,” which would allow widespread discrimination against the queer community on the basis of religious beliefs**.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump’s promises to protect the LGBTQ community are empty. Come Nov. 8 everyone should consider exactly what is at stake for the queer community ― and everyone else ― when casting their ballot.",2016-10-29 15:43:39+00:00,d9ctno4,1.0,t3_5a0zgr,299.0,politics

These women ""emerged"" because of the tape where he admitted to sexually assaulting women and felt that it was the right time to speak out as other women also started to do that. Precisely what happened to Cosby. 

If you can't understand why they would be silent in a matter like this I don't think I can help you with that but it's pretty obvious to most other people because we can see how revengeful Trump is. He threatens his victims with his lawyers and suing them like the libel bully he is. His disgusting behavior is well recorded in the media over the years.

1131,"To say that she founded her political career in opposition to gay marriage isn't quite accurate. Most Democrats and Republicans believed that marriage was between a man and a woman and so did most of America. It was just the current state of society back then and I don't really hold it against her because what matters is what she thinks about it right now. 

Even Obama was against same sex marriage in 2008 but was for it before and after. People are allowed to change their views.

Her history also shows that she's been in support of same-sex unions since 1999 and that they should have all the rights every other American gets but it seemed she believed that a religious marriage would be between a man and a woman which is what many Republicans still believe to this day.



&gt; Clinton’s statements during her 2000 Senate race

&gt; Hillary Clinton would face questions about same-sex marriage starting with her 2000 campaign for Senate. Let’s look at the highlights of her statements between 1999 and 2015 in a timeline:
&gt; 
&gt; December 1999: Clinton told a group of gay contributors at a fundraiser that she was against the ""don't ask, don't tell"" military policy signed by her husband.
&gt; 
&gt; The New York Times reported that Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act but added that ""same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets.""
&gt; 
&gt; January 2000: At a news conference in White Plains, Clinton said, ""Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman. But I also believe that people in committed gay marriages, as they believe them to be, should be given rights under the law that recognize and respect their relationship.""
&gt; 
&gt; April 2000: Clinton again expressed support for civil unions. ""I have supported the kind of rights and responsibilities that are being extended to gay couples in Vermont,"" she said.
&gt; 
&gt; July 2004: Clinton spoke on the Senate floor against a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman.""
&gt; 
&gt; However, she said she took ""umbrage at anyone who might suggest that those of us who worry about amending the Constitution are less committed to the sanctity of marriage, or to the fundamental bedrock principle that exists between a man and a woman.""
&gt; 
&gt; October 2006: Clinton told a group of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I support states making the decision,"" she said.
&gt; 
&gt; As a 2008 presidential candidate
&gt; 
&gt; In 2007, all the presidential contenders except for longshot candidates -- both Democrats and GOP -- were against same-sex marriage, the New York Times reported. So were the majority of Americans, polls showed.
&gt; 
&gt; May 2007: In a questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign in 2007, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act:
&gt; 
&gt; ""I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage.""
&gt; 
&gt; In response to a question about whether marriage should be made legally available to two committed adults of the same sex, Clinton marked that she was ""opposed"" though she stated she supported civil unions.
&gt; 
&gt; August 2007: In a Democratic primary debate sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign and LOGO Network (a gay-oriented TV station) Clinton was asked ""What is at the heart of your opposition to same-sex marriage?""
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton replied: ""Well, I prefer to think of it as being very positive about civil unions. You know, it’s a personal position. How we get to full equality is the debate we’re having, and I am absolutely in favor of civil unions with full equality of benefits, rights, and privileges.""
&gt; 
&gt; As a 2016 presidential candidate
&gt; 
&gt; As Clinton got ready for her second presidential bid, she again modified her position.
&gt; 
&gt; March 2013: After leaving her position as secretary of state, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013.

&gt;**Our conclusion**

&gt;Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000 and for the rights’ of states to set their own laws in favor of same-sex marriage in 2006.

&gt;As polls showed that a majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage, Clinton’s views changed, too. She announced her support for same-sex marriage in March 2013.

&gt;It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about her changed stance, but on same-sex marriage we give Clinton a Full Flop.

While these idiots praises Putin's and Trump's dangerous ideas tensions are increasing in Europe because of a bigger Russian presence, especially around the Baltics/Scandinavia.

1137,"&gt; Reality TV is about winning. It doesn’t matter how you manage to be a “survivor,” so long as you stay on the island. That’s the sensibility that Donald Trump, the ultimate reality-television star, brings to foreign policy.
&gt; 
&gt; In Trump’s world, winners don’t have to worry about alliances, nuclear proliferation or human rights — if they come out on top.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump’s comments during Wednesday night’s debate in Las Vegas conveyed a values-free approach to foreign policy that would make Machiavelli blush**. A generous characterization would be that he voiced an extreme “realism” that focused entirely on U.S. interests. A harsher assessment is that Trump’s amoral approach would alienate long-standing allies and potentially endanger U.S. security.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump’s disdain for traditional foreign-policy positions was clear in his positive comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even after U.S. intelligence agencies accused Russia of hacking American political parties to destabilize the election, Trump still had good things to say about the Kremlin leader**.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump seems convinced that he and Putin could achieve a kind of personal detente. “**He said nice things about me,**” Trump enthused Wednesday night. “If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.” **It’s hard to argue against greater Russian-American cooperation, but Trump seems oblivious to the possibility that he might be used by a belligerent, autocratic Kremlin leader**.
&gt; 
&gt; **As in the past, Trump seemed to take Putin’s side against President Obama and Hillary Clinton. He suggested that Putin’s military success (achieved through aggressive, destabilizing tactics in Crimea, Ukraine and Syria) shows that he’s a strong leader who’s able to push a weak United States around**.
&gt; 
&gt; Putin “has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president,” Trump said. “Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it’s Syria, you name it.”
&gt; 
&gt; An example of Putin’s supposed outsmarting of the United States was the collapse of a Sept. 12 cease-fire in Syria, which led Secretary of State John F. Kerry to suspend bilateral negotiations: “During the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don’t want the cease-fire anymore.” **Trump said the United States had been “outplayed.” Rather than condemning Russian and Syrian military strikes that devastated Aleppo and led the United States to suspend talks**, Trump said civilians there were dying “because of bad decisions” by the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump’s most astonishing comment about tough guys was his praise of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a leader who has waged a vicious civil war and used chemical weapons against his own people**. “He’s just much tougher and much smarter than her [Clinton],” Trump said, adding that if the Syrian opposition should prevail, “you may very well end up with worse than Assad.”
&gt; 
&gt; Moderator Chris Wallace eventually got Trump to “condemn” Russia’s hacking of U.S. political parties, but only after the **GOP candidate had said “I doubt it, I doubt it” about a statement accusing Russia issued by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on behalf of the 17 spy agencies he oversees. This must be the first time in our political history that a U.S. presidential candidate, after encouraging a foreign adversary to spy on the United States, challenged the evidence of wrongdoing**.
&gt; 
&gt; What role do alliances play in Trump’s realpolitik world? Not much, it seems. **Trump claimed that Clinton was telling “just another lie” when she accused him of undermining commitments to defend NATO allies in Europe and Asian allies such as Japan and South Korea. But Trump has repeated often what he said in an April 27 speech, that “the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves,**” even if that means letting them acquire nuclear weapons.
&gt; 
&gt; The big news Wednesday night was Trump’s refusal to promise he would accept the election result if he loses. But why should that be a surprise? People who’ve done business with Trump say he’s famous for holding back his final payment to contractors and negotiating for a better deal, or stiffing them altogether.
&gt; 
&gt; Leaving people in suspense about his actions is part of Trump’s self-proclaimed “art of the deal.” Why would he be any less highhanded in dealing with the American public than with his business associates?
&gt; 
&gt; For Trump, life is a validation of the cynical aphorism that “might makes right.” The best thing you can say about Clinton’s debate performance was that she took aim at this untethered, overinflated dirigible and kept landing zingers.",2016-10-29 13:58:32+00:00,d9cq565,1.0,t3_5a0j70,233.0,politics

Good to know at least, these weren't withheld by Clinton in any way but were discovered as they were investigating Weiner. They weren't from Clinton's server and they weren't sent by her either. 

None the less this was extremely careless (to use Comey's own words) to release something like this without going into more detail. They usually have no obligation to contact congress about an on-going investigation ~~but if he needed to contact them about it because he was re-opening it why didn't he contact any Democrats as well?~~

He didn't neither say if there were any allegation against Clinton, no details at all so this was just careless because it can change a lot of voters.

1162,"&gt; FBI Director James B. Comey decided to inform Congress that he would look again into Hillary Clinton’s handling of emails during her time as secretary of state for two main reasons — a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup.
&gt; 
&gt; The rationale, described by officials close to Comey’s decision-making on the condition of anonymity, prompted the FBI director to release his brief letter to Congress on Friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before Election Day. It placed Comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nation’s top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; In a memo explaining his decision to FBI employees soon after he sent his letter to Congress, Comey said he felt “an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.”
&gt; “Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record,” Comey wrote to his employees.
&gt; 
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration, said the FBI rarely releases information about ongoing criminal investigations and does not release information about federal investigations this close to political elections.
&gt; 
&gt; “Comey’s behavior in this case from the beginning has been designed to protect his reputation for independence no matter the consequences to the public, to people under investigation or to the FBI’s own integrity,” Miller said.
&gt; 
&gt; Miller and other former officials pointed to a 2012 Justice Department memo saying that all employees have the responsibility to enforce the law in a “neutral and impartial manner,” which is “particularly important in an election year.”
&gt; 
&gt; Miller said he had been involved in cases related to elected officials in which the FBI waited until several days after an election to send subpoenas. “They know that if they even send a subpoena, let alone announce an investigation, that might leak and it might become public and it would unfairly influence the election when voters have no way to interpret the information,” Miller said.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Nick Ackerman, a former federal prosecutor in New York and an assistant special Watergate prosecutor, said Comey “had no business writing to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed.”

1174,"&gt; On Wednesday, Donald Trump reiterated a previous pledge: that he would spend $100 million of his own money on the 2016 election.
&gt; 
&gt; That's particularly notable since he’s only spent $56 million with less than two weeks to go, according to the most recent campaign finance filings. In other words, it’s highly, highly questionable whether he’ll even be able to spend that much unless he literally burns it in a big, beautiful, luxurious bonfire.
&gt; 
&gt; But it’s also worth noting that the amount he’s spent thus far is actually pretty unremarkable in context — and especially given Trump’s emphasis on his personal wealth and his non-reliance on donors. If you look at U.S. elections over the past quarter-century, Trump’s self-funding total falls short of several others, even less-wealthy candidates for governor and Senate who were appealing to much smaller electorates.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, the amount Trump — whose net worth is $8 billion if you believe him and $3.7 billion if you believe Forbes magazine — has self-funded thus far is less than two candidates for governor and basically on par with two recent candidates for president and Senate.

So Trump has spent 2% of his own net worth... He's not even trying to win.

1250,"&gt; WASHINGTON ― Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) was the first congressman to say he couldn’t vote for Donald Trump after the GOP nominee’s vulgar 2005 comments surfaced. But now, less than three weeks later, Chaffetz is back on the Trump train ― sort of.
&gt; 
&gt; Chaffetz tweeted Wednesday night that while he wouldn’t defend or endorse Trump, he would vote for him.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [""I will not defend or endorse @realDonaldTrump, but I am voting for him. HRC is that bad. HRC is bad for the USA""](https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/791445788656226304).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s unclear what distinction Chaffetz sees between announcing he’ll vote for someone and endorsing them ― you know, because it’s the same thing ― but the Utah Republican seemed to think he wasn’t completely contradicting himself, even though he is.
&gt; 
&gt; Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, was quick to unendorse Trump after a recording published Oct. 7 revealed Trump talking about grabbing women by their privates and forcibly kissing them without consent.
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m out,” Chaffetz told a Utah news station. “My wife and I, we have a 15-year-old daughter, and if I can’t look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can’t endorse this person.” 
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently, Chaffetz now knows what to tell the teen. He’s back in, using Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as his excuse.

And there goes all the respect I had for Chaffetz (what was left of it anyway i.e. not much at all).",2016-10-27 11:20:04+00:00,d99tf6v,1.0,t3_59nesq,298.0,politics

1277,"&gt;  Donald Trump were to defy the polls and snatch a victory in the U.S. presidential election next month, plenty of campaign promises would be tricky to keep, such as building a border wall on Mexico’s dime or putting a blanket ban on Muslim immigrants. But Trump’s vows to tear up trade deals and slap tariffs on countries like China and Mexico would be easy to keep, quick to implement, and potentially devastating to many of the people who are cheering him and the new Republican Party on.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has for the past year promised to bring back manufacturing jobs and give a fillip to working people by taking aim at countries that export a lot of goods to the United States, especially China, Mexico, and Japan (Trump loves to compare his penalties against Japan with tariffs imposed by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, even if Reagan had mixed results) . His plan calls for steep tariffs — 35 percent for Mexico and a whopping 45 percent for imports from China — to shield U.S. industries and workers. He has also sworn to tear up NAFTA, leave the World Trade Organization, jettison the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and more.  
&gt; 
&gt; **But most economists agree that Trump’s trade plans would make Americans poorer while doing little to create jobs or stimulate manufacturing**. One study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that in the first year alone, the tariffs on Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican goods would amount to a 30 percent cut in wages and cost the average American household more than $2,200.
&gt; 
&gt; **“At one extreme, Trump succeeds at imposing a substantial increase in cost of living on American consumers with little benefit to U.S. producers,”** David Tuerck, a professor of economics at Suffolk University and one of the report’s authors, told Foreign Policy. “The other extreme is that importers find products of similar quality and similar prices elsewhere. **There’s no benefit to U.S. producers.”**
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; **The biggest threat from punitive tariffs isn’t even the direct economic cost to consumers but retaliation by other countries in the form of matching tariffs, or an all-out trade war, much as happened in the 1930s after the imposition of stiff tariffs in the United States**.
&gt; 
&gt; Like then, imports into the United States would be more expensive, and U.S. exports would be less competitive, with dire effects for the economy. A recent report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that **Trump’s trade plans could set off a tit-for-tat tariff war that would end up hurting U.S. exports and depressing growth, costing the American economy 4.8 million jobs by 2019. Many of those vaporized jobs would be in the service sector, including retail and restaurants**.
&gt; 
&gt; **“Millions of Americans, many of whom are vulnerable, have no idea that their livelihoods are at risk**,” Marcus Noland, one of the authors of the Peterson report, told FP.

1282,"Mark Cuban raised an interesting point about that a while ago:

&gt; The presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s real estate success has not necessarily yielded the wealth Trump claims, entrepreneur Mark Cuban told WABC’s “The Bernie and Sid Show” on Wednesday. He added that Trump is “not transparent enough for us to really know.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m not so sure Donald knows what he’s not good at. What he’s done well is put his name on big buildings, right? He appears to have done well putting his name through a licensing arrangement on hotels and buildings. He’s good at that. Now, whether or not that’s made him a billionaire, I don’t know,” the Dallas Mavericks owner and “Shark Tank” investor said.
&gt; 
&gt; …Cuban acknowledged Trump’s talent in real estate but questioned some of his other decisions. **He said products like branded water bottles and steak reflect “desperation.**”
&gt; 
&gt; Cuban said he asked Trump, “Are you that desperate for money?”

1293,"No. 

&gt; Clinton backer George Soros does not own voting machines in 16 states. 

&gt;According to at least a dozen fringe political blogs, Clinton already has this election bagged: Her friend George Soros, they claim, will rig the election through his electronic voting firm Smartmatic. Last week, that rumor went so viral that one concerned voter petitioned Congress to convene an emergency session on it. Nearly 25,000 people have since signed on, all apparently unaware that Soros does not own Smartmatic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s easy to see how this one spun out of control, because there is a (tenuous, mundane) connection between Soros and the London-based technology company. The company’s actual owner, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, sits on one of the boards of the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization founded by Soros. But OSF has 22 boards, with dozens of members between them. And Soros has never worked for or had an ownership stake in this specific firm, Smartmatic. Even if he had, it’s pretty much beside the point, since Smartmatic will not be in use in the United States during the 2016 elections.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately, this is a big distraction from the real problem with American voting machines — the fact that many are old, outdated and subject to error/attack. If you want to petition Congress for something, maybe try asking them to allocate funds for voting technology improvements.

1308,"I'm too tired to write it all out so I'll just quote some bits from the article. If you're really interested in the environmental aspects of such a wall I would suggest you read [the entire article](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37200583) because there's a lot more and there's a lot of things in there that many people aren't aware of when they're talking about wanting to build a wall like that.

&gt; Animals are susceptible to artificial borders of various shapes and sizes - not just walls but highways, train tracks and all sorts of man-made infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Border infrastructure not only blocks the movement of wildlife, but... destroys the habitats, fragments the habitats and the connectivity that these animals use to move from one place to another,"" Sergio Avila-Villegas, from Arizona Sonora Desert Museum in Tuscon, told Science in Action on the BBC World Service.
&gt; 
&gt; Restricting the size of mating pools can decrease genetic diversity, making animals more susceptible to diseases. Human barriers can also disrupt pollination and disturb watersheds and waterways, sometimes leading to floods that can also destroy habitat.
&gt; 
&gt; There are countless historical examples, including Antelope Valley in California where tens of thousands of antelope perished in the 1880s because they were unable to cross newly laid railway tracks.
&gt; 
&gt; In the US-Mexico border region, a number of species need to cross the border to mate with their genetically different cousins, including the endangered North American jaguar. Black bears, which were re-introduced to Texas in the 1990s, would be threatened without being able to mate with Mexican bears.
&gt; 
&gt; Dr Clint Epps, a wildlife biologist at Oregon State University, said species had been crossing the border for 3-20 million years and a physical barrier would fundamentally alter that situation - and that change would have consequences.

&gt; ""For some species, like desert bighorn sheep, you have decent populations on both sides of the border. But they depend on those movements for maintaining genetic diversity, for recolonising habitat where they've suffered local extinctions,"" he explained.
&gt; According to Dr Epps, that freedom will become even more important as the climate continues to warm and species need to move around to find suitable habitat.
&gt; 
&gt; A complete barrier could lead to a loss of local species - or even to speciation, the creation of new, distinct species as a result of populations being separated.
&gt; Mr Avila-Villegas said a complete, physical barrier would have ""effects for the ecosystem as a whole"".
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; It is not just the physical barrier that affects wildlife. Roads have been built for enforcement personnel to access the area, and helicopters and all-terrain vehicles - with their lights and sirens - are increasingly abundant.
&gt; Construction of a wall, which Trump has said would be 10-20 metres of solid concrete, would mean a substantial increase in human activity: many more roads, heavy machinery, workers' barracks and waste.
&gt; It is difficult to be very precise about how this would affect the region's wildlife. There is little baseline data and the border area is increasingly hostile for researchers and conservationists.

&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Given, however, that the stated purpose of Trump's wall is to stop the movement of people across the border, it is unlikely to incorporate passing areas for vulnerable large mammals like the desert bighorn sheep.

&gt; A large and people-proof wall is, inevitably, a major ecological intervention.

http://www.nature.com/news/trump-s-border-wall-pledge-threatens-delicate-desert-ecosystems-1.20431

Other things to consider. Let's say Trump would be elected and he chooses to build the wall. He would pay for it by making the tax payers pay for it so everybody will be instantly affected by it (as his plan is to have Mexico reimburse it later). 

The wall would cost around $20-30 billion just to build it. But then are you going to staff it? So that would increase the cost even more. Would you use cameras instead? That would also increase the costs as well because you're going to need an internet connection out in the middle of nowhere, all over the desert because it would be a long fucking wall. If you're going to staff it then you would need water and electricity for the facilities the staff are going to be work in so add a couple of billions just for that. So now we're talking about $40-50 billion? But you got to make roads as well so they can drive to work. Add 10 billion on that. 

Let's move forward a couple of years and now you would need to make severe maintenance work on the entire wall because it's crumbling by the harsh desert environment. But oh wait, now Trump's first term is up and his fours years are over because he sucked as a president. Who's going to take care of the wall now? 

One thing I forgot to account for is the time it would take to build the wall. How long would it take to build a 2,000 mile long border wall? No idea but I would assume it would take at least 5-10 years. So let's say Trump is a one term president, the wall will barely get finished and no one will support it anymore because it's a waste of everybody's money.

1311,"Haha, yeah those are some awkward videos, it's worth mentioning though that I was also on the anti-hillary-hot-sauce-doubter-train. But it actually seems to be a real thing she likes, even in the 90s way before the Beyonce video. So she's either a long con master villain or she just likes spicy food. She's right though, spicy food got some really good health benefits. 

&gt; [So there are a couple of possibilities](http://www.salon.com/2016/04/18/hillarys_hot_sauce_long_con_if_clinton_is_pandering_with_this_latest_food_revelation_its_the_most_impressive_suck_up_ever/). One is that Hillary Clinton really does like hot sauce and carries it around with her so she can season her food. The other is that she’s been building an elaborate long con over hot sauce – because she’s been talking about it at least since 2008. A New York Times piece got at Clinton’s love of hot peppers, based on a “60 Minutes” interview:
&gt; 
&gt; “I eat a lot of hot peppers,” she told CBS News anchor Katie Couric, who had asked her how she maintains her stamina on the campaign trail. “I for some reason started doing that in 1992, and I swear by it. I think it keeps my metabolism revved up and keeps me healthy.”
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently she kept 100 bottles of hot sauce when she was in the White House. In 2012, she told Conde Nast Traveler about bringing red pepper and Tabasco on her trips as Secretary of State. And late last year, she and her staff talked about peppers and farm stands.

From the 2012 Condé Nast interview:

&gt; We asked Secretary Clinton’s office what she always packs:
&gt; 
&gt; A small mesh bag filled with the basics: Sharpies, Advil, sunscreen. Converters to charge her BlackBerry and iPad anywhere in the world. Red pepper flakes and a mini bottle of Tabasco Sauce for adding spice to her meals.

1344,"&gt; For Coulter, it’s unacceptable that Ivanka Trump continues to support her father, despite mounting evidence that he denigrates women. “If Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her. But something changed for me when that tape was released,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; Ivanka Trump has since called her father’s comments on the tape “inappropriate and offensive”. But she has made excuses for his misogynist comments in the past and has enjoyed a high profile in his campaign, speaking at the Republican national convention. A recent article reported that sales revenue from her clothing line exceeded $100m last year and is growing strongly.
&gt; 
&gt; On 11 October, Coulter created the hashtag #GrabYourWallet on Twitter – a call for shoppers to vote with their wallet, as well as a pointed echo of Donald Trump’s bragging on tape about being able to approach women uninvited and “grab them by the pussy”, which he subsequently apologized for but also sought to dismiss as “locker room talk”.
&gt; 
&gt; More than a million people have viewed her posts in the last 10 days and she is receiving 200 direct replies on Twitter per day and hundreds of retweets, according to a review of the relevant social media activity.
&gt; 
&gt; Coulter estimated that more than 50,000 respondents have expressed support for her campaign and at least 2,000 have said they will participate.
&gt; 
&gt; Susan Rhodes, who lives in Palm Beach, the Florida location of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, said she joined the boycott after seeing #GrabYourWallet on Twitter, despite having previously bought a “very tasteful” pair of $400 Ivanka Trump boots from Amazon for her daughter last year.
&gt; 
&gt; “I remember working as a female banker in Florida 30 years ago and being surrounded by men saying ‘I can’t talk to you today because your boobs are staring me in the face so I can’t focus’.”
&gt; 
&gt; She said Donald Trump’s vulgarities hit a raw nerve, and now Ivanka needed to take a stand.
&gt; 
&gt; Coulter researched which stores stocked any items in Ivanka Trump’s line of clothing, shoes, perfume or accessories. The list also includes TJ Maxx, DSW, Dillards, Carson’s, Neiman Marcus, Saks Off Fifth, Stein Mart and Belk.
&gt;____

&gt;Lindsey Ledford, 29, from College Park, Maryland, who is studying full time for a degree in cybersecurity, has joined the campaign. She said she normally shopped at the bargain stores Marshalls or TJ Maxx two or three times a week, but now she would avoid them unless they stopped selling Ivanka Trump products.

&gt;“She hasn’t spoken out. The Donald Trump brand and the Ivanka Trump brand – ultimately it’s all the same thing and in good conscience, I cannot buy that,” she said.

&gt;“I don’t blame her for being supportive to her family. But the way she has positioned herself with her website, the one-stop shop for women who work and female empowerment, then acting as a surrogate for the most hateful, racist, sexist campaign – you can’t pick and choose like that,” she said, referring to Ivanka’s Women Who Work lifestyle brand.",2016-10-24 20:09:23+00:00,d961y43,1.0,t3_596r8i,12.0,politics

1428,"&gt; Hawks in Congress have long pushed the White House to consider more aggressive options in Syria from cruise missile strikes to no fly zones to humanitarian corridors. But during an off-the-record briefing on Capitol Hill on Thursday, a staffer for Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) floated a distinctly bolder approach.
&gt; 
&gt; “What about assassinating Assad?” the aide said, according to three individuals in the room.
&gt; 
&gt; The question raised eyebrows at the event, a briefing of about 75 staffers hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations. The expert receiving the question was Philip Gordon, the former White House Middle East coordinator, who dismissed the idea as both illegal and ineffective, according to a congressional aide at the event who spoke to FP on condition of anonymity.
&gt;

&gt; “I think Assad’s assassination would certainly cause chaos in Damascus,” mused Andrew Bowen, a Syria expert at the Wilson Center. “But it wouldn’t necessarily lead to the regime’s collapse, and both Russia and Iran are providing a ton of personal protection to Assad and his family. So it might not even work.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I also don’t know if we want to set the precedent of decapitating leaders, Cold War-style,” Bowen added.
&gt; 
&gt; A representative from the Council on Foreign Relations said Gordon sought to answer the aide’s question by making a case that assassinating Assad — besides being against longstanding U.S. policy — might not have a real impact on the war.

1458,"&gt; Now, with the repetition of a single word — rigged, rigged, rigged — and with the help of a few targeted Russian hacks of voter logs in Arizona and voting machines in Florida, Trump is trying his hand at another Putin trick: if you can’t inherit the land, sow it with salt.
&gt; 
&gt; We saw it in Ukraine and Georgia, who aspired to wrench themselves out of Russia’s orbit and become part of the West. Putin likely understands he’s lost these former vassals for a long time to come, but he invaded both and created territorial disputes on their land so that, even if they wanted to join an organization like NATO, they simply couldn’t because of NATO’s own rules.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump sees what we see no — matter how many unscientific post-debate polls he tweets out: the chances of him winning this election and inheriting the land are dwindling by the day. And so he is trying to toss as many handfuls of salt onto it as he can, to ruin as much of it as he can, because if he can’t have it, no one can.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump is not Putin, and America is not Russia. It wasn’t hard for Putin to destroy democratic institutions that had been around for less than a decade. We are lucky to have roots deeper and stronger than that.

&gt; Simmons’ final statement in the interview echoed concerns he expressed to Trump in an open letter late last year:
&gt; 
&gt; “The fear is that his statements would take people who would never even admit to having those seeds of hate in them and water those seeds. And then those people would say things they would never even imagine saying, and then it became the norm.”

1480,"&gt; The nation’s top intelligence official says “forensic and other” evidence proves Russian election interference.
&gt; 
&gt; At Wednesday’s debate, Donald Trump said that Hillary Clinton “has no idea whether it’s Russia” who hacked into the private networks of her campaign’s allies, then released the information to Wikileaks and the world. “Our country has no idea.”
&gt; 
&gt; This morning, without calling out Trump by name, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said, um, yeah, we do.
&gt; 
&gt; The cybersecurity community has attributed that attack and leak to FANCY BEAR, a group also known as APT 28. Defense One asked Clapper if the intelligence community has identified specific people associated with the group? Specific buildings? Units? And how good is the attribution and how strong is the connection to nation-state backing?
&gt; 
&gt; In response, Clapper cited his office’s Oct. 7 press release. “We wouldn’t have made it unless we were very confident. I’m not going to discuss the underlying evidentiary basis for it, but I can say with confidence, it speaks for itself,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The statement reads: “The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.”
&gt; 
&gt; Clapper also hinted that the intelligence community had more information about the groups than has yet been made public.
&gt; 
&gt; “That’s one of the reasons we waited for as long as we did to make the statement, was to ensure that we had sufficient evidence both forensic and otherwise, to reach the conclusion we reached as articulated in the statement. I don’t think I need to say anything more about it, other than the fact the statement speaks for itself.

1483,"No I would never want to switch. It works well and I get a lot out of it. For example I've been to my doctors office for like 4-5 times this year for an on going issue and I only pay $22 for each visit for administrative costs (including basic tests etc). If I would go over $123 within a 12 month period I don't have to pay more for each visit. Medicine is very cheap compared to the US as well and If I go over a similar limit like the one for admin costs I get various discounts which brings down the costs even more. 

Also university here is free so that helps tons of people and you can get financial aid from the government for costs of books, rent and so on. You can actually choose between taking a monthly loan + grant or just the grant and manage on your own with your living costs (I studied abroad so I couldn't use that free university privilege but I did take a loan for that so could you please ship Bernie Sanders over here?).

1512,"&gt; Pointing a finger at Russia is easy. Punishing them is hard. That’s why they hacked the DNC, according to the company that first named one of the key suspects.
&gt; 
&gt; The Russian groups behind the DNC hack no longer seem to care about getting caught. Long before the Kremlin-sponsored hacking squads APT 28 and APT 29 were making waves for stealing files from the Democratic National Committee, they made an appearance in two white papers put out by FireEye. The cybersecurity company has been monitoring and analyzing the two groups on behalf of corporate clients for years. In the DNC breach, a company spokesman told Defense One: “They wanted experts and policymakers to know that Russia is behind it.”
&gt; 
&gt; That fits a pattern of increasing bold moves over the past year by the groups, which are also known as FANCY BEAR and COZY BEAR, says Christopher Porter, the manager of Horizons, the strategic intelligence and forecasting arm of FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence, the company’s threat monitoring division.
&gt; ____
&gt; If you buy Porter’s theory, the question becomes: what kind of message could the Russians mean to send? The FireEye employee guesses that these sorts of breaches are likely a demonstration of capability, or perhaps a reprisal against the West for sanctions against Russian leaders. It’s an idea that he’s sharing with his private-sector customers.
&gt; 
&gt; “I view their activities as, they want to muddy the political response in democracies by making it seem like a complicated and ambiguous issue,” Porter said. If they’re willing to do A, B, and C then you need to understand that it’s not difficult for them to target an individual. That’s what cyber gives them. From Russia, they can pick an individual that they want to bully, using the full resources of a state organization. And that’s unprecedented. So if they decide that they want to pick on a certain corporate executive, maybe they could do a particular, hacktivist style leak. Activists go after companies all the time…it’s hard for a the company to prove that their loss was caused by a state and not by a criminal. So the policy is still complicated. That’s a nice place to be in if you’re Russia.”",2016-10-20 21:47:43+00:00,d90wzzb,1.0,t3_58jl3z,194.0,politics

Folks in this cycle know her as the one who says you can't oppose sexual assault if you like Beyoncé. But Betsy's been around forever as a person who uses dubious professional credentials to get behind all manner of straight up lies.
&gt; 
&gt; Way way way back in 1993-94 she actually played a key role in killing the Clinton health care reform, notably with a now notorious and thoroughly debunked article in The New Republic called ""No Exit"". It's frequently cited as one of the worst editorial decisions in the century long history of the magazine.
&gt; 
&gt; She managed to parlay her role killing health care reform into becoming the Lt Gov of New York, though he career in elective office later flamed out.
&gt; 
&gt; Fifteen years later she was the originator of the concept if not necessarily the name for ""death panels."" Politifact gave her a ""pants on fire"" for this latest policy falsehood.
&gt; 
&gt; Now she's back as Donald Trump's credentialed expert propagating the 'voter fraud' myth. On CNN this morning she spouted a series of straight up lies about on the subject, essentially hijacking a whole segment on whether Trump would accept the results of the election. ""This nation has been victimized by rampant election fraud,"" McCaughey said.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not too much to say that no one in recent decades has introduced more lies into the public policy and political discussion under the cover of professional credentials than Betsy McCaughey.

1524,"&gt; A Donald Trump ally completely hijacked a CNN segment Thursday morning, denying that Trump refused to say in the final presidential debate that he'd accept the results of the election and spewing an impressive amount of misinformation about voter fraud.
&gt; 
&gt; Betsy McCaughey, known for invoking Beyoncé lyrics to defend Trump's infamous hot mic tape, didn't even let host Carol Costello ask any questions before she began rallying against the characterization that Trump had refused to say he'd accept the results of the election.
&gt; 
&gt; ""First of all he did not say he would refuse to accept,"" McCaughey said after being introduced. ""That's the distortion. He said wait and see.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Wait and see,"" she continued. ""That's different from refusing.""
&gt; 
&gt; From there the panel devolved into chaos, as McCaughey continued to insist that there is widespread voter fraud in elections, while CNN contributor Sally Kohn and Costello tried to explain to her that there is no evidence for that assertion.
&gt; 
&gt; ""This nation has been victimized by rampant election fraud,"" McCaughey said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""No, no, no,"" Kohn protested.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; “Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president,” Clinton responded. “It's pretty clear you won't admit that the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line.”
&gt; 
&gt; ""No puppet, no puppet. You’re the puppet. No you’re the puppet,"" Trump interjected over Clinton's answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Critics have said Trump has an awfully soft spot for the Russian leader, most recently after he refused to accept the analysis of the intelligence community that Russian-directed hackers were behind email leaks from the Democratic National Committee, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, and others.

1553,"&gt; **Trump knows Putin. Or does he?**
&gt; 
&gt; Back in May 2014, Trump said he “spoke, indirectly and directly, with President Putin.”
&gt; 
&gt; In November 2015, Trump said he “got to know him very well because we were both on '60 Minutes.' We were stablemates, and we did very well that night.”
&gt; 
&gt; And then in July, Trump said at a news conference in Florida: “I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is.”
&gt; 
&gt; *The verdict: No, Trump has never met Putin. He'd like to some day, and he has expressed interest in becoming his best friend. But none of that has happened yet.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Does Trump have business with Russia?** 
&gt; 
&gt; Trump in the second debate flatly declared: “I don't deal there. I have no businesses there.” But there's all kinds of evidence, including statements from his advisers and family members, that Trump has done business with Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; His son, Donald Trump Jr., said in 2008 that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.”
&gt; 
&gt; Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, told our colleagues in May: “I have no doubt, as a company, I know we’ve looked at deals in Russia. And many of the former Russian republics.”
&gt; 
&gt; *The verdict: It's really hard to accept that Trump has never done any dealings with Russia.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Russia is hacking the U.S. campaign. Or is it?**
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has never accepted the Clinton campaign's assertion that hackers controlled by the Kremlin are trying interfere in the 2016 elections; even after the Obama administration officially accused Russia, Trump has maintained his doubt.
&gt; 
&gt; But his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, contradicted Trump, saying Sunday on “Meet the Press”: “I think there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia.”
&gt; 
&gt; *The verdict: The GOP ticket has yet to work that out. Russia has denied it.*
&gt; 
&gt; **Putin isn't in Ukraine. Or is he?**
&gt; 
&gt; In July, Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that Putin is “not going into Ukraine, okay, just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want.”
&gt; 
&gt; Stephanopoulos took it here: He told Trump that Putin had already acknowledged that the Russian military seized Crimea so that Russia could annex it.
&gt; 
&gt; To which Trump responded: “Okay — well, he's there in a certain way. But I'm not there.”
&gt; 
&gt; *The verdict: Trump later clarified that what he meant was: “Putin is there. But don't blame Donald Trump for that.”*
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump knows nothing about Russia. Or does he?**
&gt; 
&gt; The verdict: It depends on the day.

&gt; 
&gt; * He might have undisclosed financial interests that depend of the backing of the Russian government. Trump's tax returns could shed light on whether this is the case, but he refuses to release them.
&gt; 
&gt; * His foreign policy is based on a calculus of pure vanity — namely, that he supports people who compliment him, as Putin has, and attacks those who criticize him.
&gt; 
&gt; * He genuinely admires Putin's authoritarian-thug approach to leadership and sees him as a model for his own governance, should he be elected.

&gt; To just about everyone except Trump, Putin presents a clear threat to the security of America and its allies. His goal is to destabilize Western Europe while reassembling much of the old Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact alliances to their former glory.

1) Let's address the latest manufactured Clinton email scandal about an alleged “quid pro quo”

2) [The claim: Patrick Kennedy a senior State official offered a “quid pro quo” to the FBI to declassify an email found in Clinton's server](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu-4ghnVMAAn3PQ.jpg)

3) The “scandal” is presumably that Kennedy did this to save HRC’s skin – so that she could claim she never sent/received classified emails

4) [This is based on FBI interview transcripts just released – see pages 25-29 in this FBI release](https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view). https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-04-of-04/view

5) [First, if you read the FBI notes, you’ll see how the Weekly Standard story is deeply misleading from the very start](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu-4234UsAQQPZD.jpg)

7) [So, this is ENTIRELY about the common practice of RETROACTIVE classification – something I’ve discussed before](http://electionado.com/post/1471806012661)

9) [So this tweet is very misleading; HRC’s comment applied to emails not classified at time they were sent/received](https://twitter.com/mattzap/status/788031937013288960)

10) [Third, “quid pro quo” comment was from lone FBI official; no evidence that Kennedy offered a “quid pro quo”](https://twitter.com/mattzap/status/788037301838512128)

1646,"Wow this was a good read:

&gt; Spies also took Garten to task for what he called “litigious threats and bullying.” **Should Trump “actually be elected Commander-in-Chief, will you be the one writing the cease and desist letters to Vladimir Putin, or will that be handled by outside counsel?”**
&gt; 
&gt; As a candidate for President, Spies continued, “your client is a public figure and his campaign should, and will, be fact-checked. The ability to criticize a candidate’s record, policies and matters of public importance lies at the heart of the First Amendment, as courts have repeatedly recognized.** If you have the time between bankruptcy filings and editing reality show contracts, we urge you to flip through the Supreme Court’s decision in New York Times v. Sullivan.”** (In this decision, the Court held that the First Amendment “protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials except when statements are made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity).”)
&gt; 
&gt; **“If your client is so thin-skinned that he cannot handle his critics’ presentation of his own public statements, policies and record to the voting public, and if such communications hurts his feelings, he is welcome to purchase airtime to defend his record,” Spies wrote. “After all, a wall can be built around many things, but not around the First Amendment.”**
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, Spies pointed out that federal candidates are prohibited from using corporate resources for campaign purposes according to the Federal Election Campaign Act and the FEC’s regulations. **Although Trump “may think he is above the law and be accustomed to using lawsuits to bail out his failed business deals,” he wrote**, “the Federal Election Campaign Act and the FEC’s Regulations nonetheless apply to him and his campaign. Perhaps the attached complaint, filed today, will serve as a reminder of your client’s legal obligations under federal election laws. Just as your client is attempting to quickly learn the basics of foreign policy, we wish you personally the best in your attempts to learn election law.”",2016-10-17 15:22:21+00:00,d8vsrja,1.0,t3_57xovi,2090.0,politics

1656,"&gt; At 7:51 p.m. on Wednesday night, Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile got an odd email from the Gmail account of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. “We have a problem,” read the subject line.
&gt; 
&gt; “Donna, some of our less than reliable media people are starting to privately question the Russian hack story we’ve been feeding them about these emails that [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange keeps leaking,” it read, according to a copy of the email Brazile shared with Yahoo News. It went on to say “HRC wants us to come up with a backup story to keep them guessing until we get to E-day in case we need to use it.”
&gt; 
&gt; The email was unlike any Podesta would actually write — and for good reason. It was fake. He wrote no such missive, says a Clinton campaign official. But the message, using a cloned version of Podesta’s real Gmail address, was a vivid example of the mischief Russian hackers — and WikiLeaks — have unleashed by dumping thousands of stolen emails into the public domain, say Democratic party officials and cybersecurity experts.
&gt; 
&gt; “This is part of the disinformation campaign,” said Brazile, who quickly alerted the DNC’s cybersecurity officials so they could try to trace the email to its original source.  So far, they haven’t cracked the case. But party and Clinton campaign officials are increasingly on guard for similar phony messages. In one case, party officials tell Yahoo News, a malicious unidentified spoofer replicated the email address of the DNC’s press secretary and sent the New York Times a phony op-ed from Tim Kaine. “We’re a political party operating under tremendous stress,” said Brazile.

&gt; The Clinton campaign on Friday ramped up its efforts to put a spotlight on Russia’s role in the cyberattacks on the DNC and other party organizations, arranging a conference call led by former acting CIA director Michael Morrell. He said the hacks were “a direct assault on our democracy” and called on Donald Trump to condemn them.
&gt; 
&gt; But in fact, there is no indication the phony Podesta message was the work of Russian state-sponsored hackers, say cybersecurity experts. It’s far more likely it was sent by cyberspoofers using relatively accessible Internet tools to replicate an email address, using or installing a STMP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email server. In the case of Podesta email, the spoofer also used a separate “reply to” email service — a sort of throwaway inbox to weed out junk email — presumably so that Podesta would have been completely unwitting if Brazile had actually responded.",2016-10-17 14:08:50+00:00,d8vpjf2,1.0,t3_57xhvh,18.0,politics

1695,"&gt; Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said evidence implicates Russia in recent email hacks tied to the U.S. election, contradicting his running mate, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on Russia's involvement.
&gt; 
&gt; Pence said in an interview aired on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Russia or any other country involved in hacking should face ""severe consequences."" The disagreement with Trump, the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election, came after the pair also publicly disagreed about U.S. policy toward Russia in Syria.
&gt; 
&gt; U.S. intelligence officials believe Russia is behind recent email hacks targeting Democratic Party officials, including the continuing dumps by Wikileaks of documents stolen from the email account of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I think there's no question that the evidence continues to point in that direction,"" Pence said. ""There should be severe consequences to Russia or any sovereign nation that is compromising the privacy or the security of the United States of America.""
&gt; 
&gt; In another interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Pence said ""there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia,.""
&gt; 
&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin this week said his country was not involved in trying to influence the U.S. election.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump, who has been criticized for appearing too close to Russia after he publicly praised Putin's strength, has questioned the reports of Moscow's involvement. During last week's second debate with Clinton he said, ""Maybe there is no hacking.""
&gt; 
&gt; Trump also broke with Pence during that debate on their foreign policy stance toward Russia. Pence had recently said the United States should use military force in Syria if Russia continued airstrikes to prop up President Bashar al-Assad, but Trump said he disagreed with that stance.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump this week has said the election is being ""rigged"" against him by the Clinton campaign and the media, raising questions about whether he would challenge the outcome should he lose to Clinton.
&gt; 
&gt; Pence said on ""Face the Nation"" Republicans would accept the result.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We'll respect the outcome of this election,"" he said. ""Donald Trump said in the first debate that we'll respect the will of the American people in this election. The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of American history.""

It is up to all patriots, regardless of party or politics, to reject this nihilistic development vociferously and without hesitation.
&gt; 
&gt; I would hope that Americans are not seduced into complacency by the marble temples to our democracy in our nation's capital. They may evoke the stability of a centuries-old republic, but they are but relatively recent additions to our national landscape - as is our entire democratic experiment when compared to the history of human society and government. We dare not tempt the limits of our political stability.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost every change of government in world history has been accompanied by bloodshed. So too was the birth of our nation in revolution. But our Founders, flawed as they were, understood that stability amidst a vast geography and diverse polity required peaceful transfers of power. In 1800, before our national traditions had calcified, the young United States faced a severe test in a bitter and nasty presidential election. In the end, however, John Adams acceded to the will of the American people and turned over power to his archrival Thomas Jefferson. The history books call it the ""Revolution of 1800"", notable for the peacefulness with which it transpired compared to the Revolution forged in war just a few years earlier.
&gt; 
&gt; That precedent has been the rule in almost every election that has followed - even the most contentious one in recent times, 2000. There Al Gore, even in the face of a very controversial Supreme Court decision, chose to concede rather than step towards the cliff of an unknowable abyss.
&gt; 
&gt; The most notable exception to these peaceful transitions is that of Abraham Lincoln and our bloodiest chapter of Civil War. We are nowhere near that level today, but Trump is stoking irresponsible talk of armed rebellion. And some of the quotes coming from his supporters at rallies should send terrors down the spine of all peaceful Americans. Some will argue that Trump is not alone in bearing the blame, that the Republican party has tried to delegitimize President Obama since his landslide election in 2008. The latest refusal to vote on his Supreme Court nominee is seen as a stark symptom of this recalcitrance.
&gt; 
&gt; But there is a long way between political obstructionism and inciting violence. To his credit, Mike Pence tamped down talk of rebellion at a recent rally. However more is needed. Much more. I have a sinking feeling in my gut that with some fringe supporters we have already gone too far.
&gt; 
&gt; But I remain an optimist and return to the lessons from back in 1800. Over the years that followed Adams and Jefferson built a friendship, largely through a remarkable correspondence. They both died fatefully on July 4, 1826, 50 years to the day of the Declaration of Independence. Adams' family recorded his last words as ""Thomas Jefferson survives."" In reality Jefferson had died several hours earlier, and there is some dispute about whether Adams actually said this famous sentence. But regardless, the spirit of reconciliation across political differences rang true. And I hope it still does after November 8.",2016-10-16 00:12:31+00:00,d8tpb4v,1.0,t3_57nuk3,14555.0,politics

1741,"&gt;  They kept him on message (relative to how he was) for a while, but what Trump has done since the end of this summer does nothing to expand or even maintain his base of support.

That's the strange part. They stopped expanding Trump's base and is now going full blown tin foil hat with his conspiracies and denial. If he had owned up to the tape, done a real apology and an interview it would have at least softened the blow. Instead he doubled down and attacked like always. 

As his family plays a big part of his campaign I can see why they are going after everyone (because according to Ivanka that's something Donald taught her as well) but how much control does Conway, Stephen Miller, Carter Page, Bannon have over him? Bannon is obviously feeding him conspiracies and pushing that angle but the campaign seems so fractured in what way it wants to go. 

If Trump is starting a media network I'm suspecting they haven't told Conway or the talking heads about it. 

That election debriefing sounds really interesting. Is there video of it and do you know if they will do that for this year as well?

1796,"&gt; Donald Trump has ramped up his attacks against the women accusing him of sexual assault, firing back at them personally at a campaign rally without using their names.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking in front of a rowdy crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, Friday afternoon, Trump said all of the allegations were lies, called one accuser a **“horrible woman**,” told his followers to look up another on Facebook and said another accuser “**would not be my first choice**.”
&gt; 
&gt; “**When you looked at that horrible woman last night, you said, ‘I don’t think so**,'” he said about one of his accusers.
&gt; 
&gt; The rally was Trump’s most aggressive effort yet to defend himself on the sexual assault allegations that have come out since he denied ever touching women inappropriately at the second presidential debate. **He mocked the allegations, calling them lies and, at one point, even mimicking grabbing someone with his hand**.

&gt; While Trump was speaking, former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos was holding a press conference in which she said that in 2007 Trump kissed her, groped her and attempted to seduce her during what she thought was a professional dinner meeting.
&gt; 
&gt;**At the rally, Trump called People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who claims he forcibly kissed her in 2005 while she was writing an article about him, a liar, and may have implied for the second time that she was not attractive enough for him to try to kiss**. (On Thursday, he said of Stoynoff, “Look at her, look at her words, you tell me what you think. I don’t think so.”)
&gt; 
&gt; “**She is a liar,” he said. “Check out her Facebook page, you’ll understand**.”
&gt; 
&gt; He also attacked the appearance of Jessica Leeds, who claims Trump groped her on an airplane. “**Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you**,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; He also questioned the most recent allegation, from a woman named Kristin Anderson in the Washington Post today , who says that he put his hand up her skirt at a club, arguing it could not be true because he doesn’t ever go to clubs by himself.
&gt; 
&gt; “I was sitting alone in some club? I really don’t sit alone that much, folks,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump categorically denied the allegations against him, arguing alternately that the women were doing so for attention and that they were part of a media conspiracy to bring down his campaign, singling out New York Times shareholder Carlos Slim, who is Mexican, as partly responsible for the coverage.
&gt; 
&gt; “They have no witnesses,” he said of the accusers. “There’s nobody around. They just come out. Some are doing it for probably a little fame. They get some free fame.”",2016-10-14 19:45:19+00:00,d8s6t99,1.0,t3_57iae2,252.0,politics

1803,"&gt; It should come as no surprise that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is as ignorant about constitutional law as he is about every other matter pertinent to the nation’s highest office.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, the letter Mr. Trump’s lawyers sent to The Times on Wednesday — in which he threatened to sue the newspaper for publishing an article detailing two women’s allegations that Mr. Trump had groped or kissed them without consent — is extraordinary in its complete misunderstanding of both the facts and the law.
&gt; 
&gt; The letter charged the article with being “libelous,” “reckless” and “defamatory,” called it a “politically-motivated effort to defeat Mr. Trump’s candidacy” and accused The Times of inadequately investigating the truth of the claims.
&gt; 
&gt; Similar accounts by other women were published recently in The Palm Beach Post, in People magazine, by NBC News and by a television station in Washington State.
&gt; ___
&gt; In his opinion for the court, Justice William Brennan Jr. wrote that “public discussion is a political duty, and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.” Such discussion “may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”
&gt; 
&gt; In Donald Trump’s view, these principles shouldn’t exist. “**I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,**” he said in February. Never mind that as president, he would have no power to alter state libel laws.
&gt; 
&gt;** Of course, Mr. Trump’s threat to sue may be an empty one, as so many of his previous threats — intended mainly to energize his angry base — have been. But it is yet another frightening reminder of what a Trump presidency could bring**.",2016-10-14 17:29:53+00:00,d8s07zc,1.0,t3_57hkck,75.0,politics

1808,"&gt; After a series of women accused Donald Trump of forcing himself on them, one of the Republican nominee's advisers took a swing at their credibility. “These allegations are decades old,” A.J. Delgado told MSNBC's Chris Hayes on Wednesday. “If somebody actually did that, Chris, any reasonable woman would have come forward and said something.”
&gt; 
&gt; Debra Katz, a civil rights lawyer in the nation's capital, disagreed. It's more common for women who endure harassment to stay silent, she said. They worry people won’t believe them. They fear retaliation.
&gt; 
&gt; National data backs her up. A June report from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that just 6 to 13 percent of sexual harassment victims ever file a formal complaint, and less than a third share their experience with a manager or union representative.
&gt; 
&gt; “They anticipate and fear a number of reactions,” the report says. “Disbelief of their claim ... Damage to their career and reputation.”
&gt; 
&gt; A February survey of 2,235 American women, meanwhile, shows one in three respondents had encountered sexual harassment at work, and 71 percent chose not to tell their employer.
&gt; 
&gt; High-profile cases, however, tend to encourage victims to speak up, even if years have passed, Katz said. This summer, as several female Fox News employees accused media juggernaut Roger Ailes of pressuring them to have sex with him, her firm noted an upswing of women seeking legal advice. They saw others pursuing justice, she said, and felt emboldened to do the same.
&gt; 
&gt; The mountain of accusations against Bill Cosby inspired a similar trend. After dozens of women over the past two years publicly said Cosby raped them, police departments nationwide recorded increases in women reporting years-old sexual assaults. (New York Police Chief Bill Bratton called this “the Cosby effect."")",2016-10-14 17:11:39+00:00,d8rzbix,1.0,t3_57hgpi,79.0,politics

1866,"&gt; New York, October 13, 2016--In an unprecedented step, the Committee to Protect Journalists today released a statement recognizing that a Donald Trump presidency would represent a threat to press freedom. In response to Trump's threats and vilification of the media during his campaign, the chairman of CPJ's board, Sandra Mims Rowe, issued the following statement on behalf of the organization:

&gt; Guaranteeing the free flow of information to citizens through a robust, independent press is essential to American democracy. For more than 200 years this founding principle has protected journalists in the United States and inspired those around the world, including brave journalists facing violence, censorship, and government repression.
&gt; 
&gt; Donald Trump, through his words and actions as a candidate for president of the United States, has consistently betrayed First Amendment values. On October 6, CPJ's board of directors passed a resolution declaring Trump an unprecedented threat to the rights of journalists and to CPJ's ability to advocate for press freedom around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Since the beginning of his candidacy, Trump has insulted and vilified the press and has made his opposition to the media a centerpiece of his campaign. Trump has routinely labeled the press as ""dishonest"" and ""scum"" and singled out individual news organizations and journalists.
&gt; 
&gt; He has mocked a disabled New York Times journalist and called an ABC News reporter a ""sleaze"" in a press conference. He expelled Univision anchor Jorge Ramos from a campaign press conference because he asked an ""impertinent"" question, and has publicly demeaned other journalists.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has refused to condemn attacks on journalists by his supporters. His campaign has also systematically denied press credentials to outlets that have covered him critically, including The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico, The Huffington Post, The Daily Beast, Univision, and The Des Moines Register.
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout his campaign, Trump has routinely made vague proposals to limit basic elements of press and internet freedom. At a rally in February, Trump declared that if elected president he would ""open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money."" In September, Trump tweeted, ""My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting.""
&gt; 
&gt; While some have suggested that these statements are rhetorical, we take Trump at his word. His intent and his disregard for the constitutional free press principle are clear.
&gt; 
&gt; A Trump presidency would represent a threat to press freedom in the United States, but the consequences for the rights of journalists around the world could be far more serious. Any failure of the United States to uphold its own standards emboldens dictators and despots to restrict the media in their own countries. This appears to be of no concern to Trump, who indicated that he has no inclination to challenge governments on press freedom and the treatment of journalists.
&gt; 
&gt; When MSNBC's Joe Scarborough asked him in December if his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin was at all tempered by the country's history of critical journalists being murdered, his response was: ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country... Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too.""
&gt; 
&gt; Through his words and actions, Trump has consistently demonstrated a contempt for the role of the press beyond offering publicity to him and advancing his interests.
&gt; 
&gt; For this reason CPJ is taking the unprecedented step of speaking out now. This is not about picking sides in an election. This is recognizing that a Trump presidency represents a threat to press freedom unknown in modern history.",2016-10-13 19:11:11+00:00,d8qnjh1,1.0,t3_57c1aw,149.0,politics

1884,"**Clinton perception steady** 

By a margin of 40.3%-49.8%, Michigan voters have an unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton.  These numbers are statistically identical to the early October post-debate survey.  

**Clinton leads in two-way, four-way races** 

In a two-way race, Clinton holds a commanding 47.2%-33.4% lead on Trump – a lead of 14 points.   Among those voters who are definitely voting for their candidate, Clinton holds a lead of 40.2%-27.3% on Trump – a lead of 13 points among highly committed voters in a two-way race.

After the first debate, Clinton led Trump by a margin of 41.9%-35.1%. Clinton’s numbers have remained statistically unchanged at 42%. But Trump’s support has declined by 4.5%.  As the chart below indicates, the only statistical change from the prior survey has been in Trump’s support. As Election Day approaches, Trump appears to be losing support – not gaining support.

**Trump: 0% support among African-American voters, 0% in Detroit** 

The survey didn't find a single African-American voter supporting Trump, nor did it find a single supporter in the city of Detroit.

Survey numbers among demographic groups and geographic regions have larger margins of error, and it's almost certain Trump has some, though minimal, support among African-American and Detroit voters. However, this marks the third-consecutive survey Trump has polled at 0% in Detroit, signifying an unusually low level of support in Detroit for the Republican nominee. 

**Trump 'not qualified' increases**

In all, 65% of Michigan voters said Trump is not qualified to be president, according to the poll. This represents a 3% increase in unqualified from the survey two weeks ago. A total of 28% of Michigan voters believe Donald Trump is qualified to be president.

Drilling down, 69% of women in both surveys found Trump to be unqualified for president.  But the percentage of men finding Trump unqualified increased from 55.9% to 60.8%. 

And, 23% of women and 33% of men believe Trump is qualified to be President.

On the other side, 56.3% of voters believe Clinton is qualified to be president while 38.7% believe she is not qualified. These numbers have remained statistically unchanged from the post-convention survey in August 2016.  

**Poll: Clinton won second debate**

The poll found 68.2% of Michigan voters watched the second presidential debate. By a margin of 48.7-25.4%, they said Clinton won the debate over Trump. About 21% of likely voters said neither candidate won. ",2016-10-13 15:45:53+00:00,d8qddt7,1.0,t3_57awyg,108.0,politics

1886,"&gt;**In the midst of our bountiful October harvest of Trump grotesqueries, the Russians and Julian Assange organized a WikiLeaks dump of private emails from the Clinton campaign. These revealed a shocking and scandalous fact about the former Secretary of State: she is a politician. Indeed, the documents represent one of the most reassuring moments of this calamitous campaign. The overwhelming impression is of the candidate’s and her staff’s competence and sanity–and something more: a refreshing sense of reality about the vagaries of politics**.
&gt; 
&gt; The headline revelation came from one of Clinton’s paid speeches. Clinton said it was necessary for politicians to have a “public and private position” on many issues. Gotcha! And even though Clinton had difficulty defending herself on this in the second debate, she’s absolutely right. In one of his rare moments of candor earlier this year, Donald Trump agreed. He said his ludicrous tax-cut plan was an opening position that would be compromised–he might even back higher taxes–when negotiations began with Congress. This was deemed disastrous by conservative ideologues, and Trump quickly retreated from it. But he was, momentarily, speaking the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s how Clinton put it in that 2013 speech, and be prepared, I’m going to quote her at length: “Politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching … all of the backroom discussions and the deals … then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position. And finally, I think–I believe in evidence-based decisionmaking. I want to know what the facts are.” Clinton is speaking an essential, uncontroversial truth about how things work in a democracy. And yet, for much of the public–and too much of our media–her sentiments are perceived as shifty, further evidence that she can’t be trusted, as if a willingness to compromise were a sign of weakness, not a necessary strength.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the rest of the emails, there are the occasional screw-ups and embarrassing moments of candor, but–as with the WikiLeaks dump of the State Department’s diplomatic cables–the most striking thing about them is the careful, intelligent way in which the Clinton staff goes about the business of politics. There is substantive consternation about how to deal with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Wall Street, a careful massaging of where to come down on Warren’s proposal for a new Glass-Steagall law to regulate banking. Clinton and her advisers believe that Sanders is being too simplistic, that they have an equally tough but more nuanced position–as indeed they did–and they worry about how to communicate that difference. Watching the deliberations unfold, I found myself thinking, Boy, Assange has done a public service. It’s good to know how policy develops in a political campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; Another so-called embarrassment is the contretemps between Chelsea Clinton and her father’s former top aide, Doug Band, who writes that she’s acting like a “spoiled brat.” Band left the Clinton fold and formed a private “consulting” firm called Teneo Holdings. Bill Clinton agreed to be a member of its advisory board, a very questionable position for a former President to take. Chelsea finds out in England that at least one Teneo employee is lobbying Members of Parliament “on behalf of President Clinton” to take positions favorable to Teneo clients “without my father’s knowledge … which would horrify my father.” Bill Clinton soon cuts off his relationship with Band, a wise move. (Too bad Chelsea wasn’t vetting the recently revealed, too-close-for-comfort emails between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation after the Haiti earthquake.)
&gt; 
&gt; Some on the left will find Clinton’s attempts to flatter and find common ground with her Wall Street audiences offensive–her willingness to take money for these speeches was a big mistake–but if you look at the content of the talks, Clinton is essentially warning the bankers about the public’s belief that they have behaved badly, while calling for more “transparency” and reform, a message her audiences may not have wanted to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; **Here’s a final outrage: Clinton told executives at Xerox that she wanted a “moderate” Democratic Party. Indeed, she wanted “two sensible, moderate, pragmatic political parties.” Wow. How crazy is that**?",2016-10-13 14:40:06+00:00,d8qa9xw,1.0,t3_57akbi,195.0,politics

1892,"&gt; Barbara Res worked for Donald Trump for 18 years as a construction executive, and asked Thursday if she believed the allegations of sexual misconduct and assault against him, she was frank.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I do believe it. Yes, absolutely,"" Res told CNN's Alisyn Camerota in an interview on ""New Day."" ""He's a blatant sexist.""

&gt; ""**I saw him be aggressive in business, and throw his weight around and use the fact that he had power. And I think sexual assault and sexual harassment are really about the abuse of power -- 'I can do this to you because I am who I am' -- I do think it went to his head**. So much else went to his head that it does make sense to me that he would do something like that,"" Res, who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I worked for him a while ago, and when we started out he was respectful of women,"" Res said, pointing to the moderating influence at the time of Trump's mother and his then-wife, Ivana. ""He respected and listened to us, and I never saw him comport himself in such a way that, you know, you would turn around and say, that was sexist.""
&gt; ""**As time went on,"" she said, ""he became more and more forceful. He said women were chasing after him and women were following him. And women wanted to have sex with him and then at a point in time he said that he was spending so much time off having sex with so many women that his business went down. He blamed his brother and his executives for the crash of his business**.""
&gt; Res recounted the story of a meeting she attended with Trump and an architect as an example of how Trump's attitude had regressed.
&gt; ""**We had a meeting with an architect once which was really shocking to me. Out of nowhere, he started talking about the women in Marina Del Rey, and how they're not like the women in Beverly Hills, they have to work harder so their bodies -- he described their bodies as being tighter and stuff like that**. The architect and I looked at each other and we didn't know where this came from,"" Res said. ""**At the time, I thought, he is having this breakdown because his empire is falling apart and maybe, you know, it's just a temporary thing. But, obviously, it got worse**.""
&gt; 
&gt; But Res hasn't always been so critical of her boss. Camerota asked the former Trump employee to explain why she wrote in her 2013 memoir that Trump was ""the least sexist boss I ever had.""
&gt; ""That's an honest statement,"" Res said. ""He treated me like the men -- he yelled at the men and cursed at me like he did. But he respected me, so that was not sexist.""
&gt; But Res said that recent developments from the 2016 presidential campaign have caused her to revise her view of him.
&gt; ""**Based on what I know now, and what I saw of his comments in writing and in the press and the things that he said to Howard Stern, I could never say that he wasn't a sexist because he is such a blatant sexist. I would retract that statement**,"" she said.
&gt; ____
&gt; 
&gt; Res also explained why she is supporting Clinton for president.

&gt; **""First of all, everyone knows he has no experience. I mean, the idea that he would be president is just ridiculous. I have other developers I worked for who were just smarter than he is -- and I wouldn't vote for them for president either. And I mean, you need to have some experience and some knowledge of government**,"" she said.

&gt; ""**But the worst thing about Trump and the reason not to vote for him, is his temperament,"" she said. ""He flies off the handle, and he attacks viciously. You know, it's like shooting someone and having a nuclear bomb come back at you**.""",2016-10-13 13:51:00+00:00,d8q85jo,1.0,t3_57abr0,209.0,politics

&gt; Whoever sexually touches a child under fifteen or induces the child to undertake or participate in an act with sexual implications, convicted of sexual assault to a fine or imprisonment not exceeding two years.
&gt; The same applies to the one who exposes himself to another in a way that is likely to cause discomfort or, by words or conduct harasses a person in a way that is likely to violate the person's sexual integrity.
&gt; 
&gt; Sexual assault may be for example flashing or groping, which is most common. It can also be sexting or sex chat with a child under 15 years. The crucial difference between an assault and a sexual assault is whether there is a sexual element. The penalty for sexual assault is a fine or imprisonment not exceeding two years.",2016-10-13 01:17:28+00:00,d8pneqy,7.0,t1_d8pmypa,648.0,politics
1912,"&gt; Donald Trump deliberately walked in on two young Miss USA 2001 contestants while they were naked and getting dressed for a rehearsal, one of the former beauty contestants has claimed in an interview with the Guardian.
&gt; 
&gt; The two women were putting on their outfits to rehearse the opening number, the former contestant recalled, when Trump, who owned the pageant at the time as part of the Miss Universe family of pageants, burst into the room without a word.

&gt; Just before he entered, the former contestant said, she heard the security detail outside the dressing room tell someone approaching the door that the women inside were naked.
&gt; 
&gt; “Mr Trump just barged right in, didn’t say anything, stood there and stared at us,” she recalled. Trump’s attitude, she said, seemed to be: “I can do this because I can.”
&gt; 
&gt; “He didn’t walk in and say, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry, I was looking for someone,’” she continued. “He walked in, he stood and he stared. He was doing it because he knew that he could.”",2016-10-13 01:02:27+00:00,d8pmsi9,1.0,t3_577n8b,111.0,politics

1914,"It depends on which country's laws you go by. I live in Sweden and there's a wider definition of rape here hence our statistics being very high.

&gt; Rape is defined as the penetration of the penis into the vagina, anus or mouth without consent. Many countries are also including the concept of rape ""a comparable sexual act"", for example, penetration by foreign objects, or **touching of the genitals**.

&gt; Anyone who by assault or otherwise by force or by threat of criminal acts are forcing a person to sexual intercourse or to undertake or endure another sexual act with regard to the nature of the violation and the circumstances are **comparable to sexual intercourse**, shall be sentenced for rape to imprisonment at least two and a maximum of six years.

So I think it's depends on each case. Nonetheless I've read about Trump's sexual adventures from earlier where he actually had fingers inside. So ""rapist"" still applies, maybe not to US law for these two cases though but considering Trump's previous history of rape.

1940,"För att dom är verkligen jättetråkiga. Det är inte 100% verifierat att alla email är riktiga ens. Ryssland har en lång historia att manipulera sånt här och det kan vara så att 90% är äkta och 10% är påhittat eller manipulerat på något sätt. 

Mailen bekräftar bara det många redan trodde eller tyckte om Clinton och hennes kollegor, att hon är en proffs politiker med en väldigt lång historia och stort kontaktnät. 

Många saker som det skrivits om redan är feltolkningar om information som redan var ""public information"" som vem som helst kunde titta upp eller information som tagits ur sitt sammanhang för att framstå som något annat, som med DOJ collusion-grejen:

&gt; The communication between Fallon and the DOJ, revealed by WikiLeaks, only concerned the FOIA lawsuit, and not the investigation into Clinton's email use. There is no evidence DOJ communicated with Fallon on other issues, including its email investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; In an email on May 19, 2015, Fallon advised of upcoming action in a civil lawsuit by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold that resulted in the State Department releasing tens of thousands of Clinton's emails.
&gt; ""DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,"" Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote.
&gt; The hearing Fallon was referring to was publicly available information and covered extensively at the time by CNN, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Politico, Vice, National Journal and The Hill, among others.

Så hittils har det knappt varit något intressant att egentligen skriva om. Ännu viktigare är det (tycker jag iaf) att skriva om varför det ens hände, vem det var som gjorde det (Ryssland), och om media ens ska visa material som är från en personlig email (podestas gmail) som är stulen på det här sättet. 

Och vad för roll Trumps kampanj har att göra med det. Uppenbarligen har dom någon kontakt med Assange eftersom Roger Stone visste flera dagar innan att dom skulle släppa Podestas email.

1992,"&gt; Fox News host Shep Smith launched a blistering attack on Donald Trump Monday, questioning what the GOP presidential nominee’s real motives are.
&gt; 
&gt; Smith railed against Trump for pandering to his voter base by attacking his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during Sunday night’s presidential debate. He also criticized the brash businessman for failing to court undecided voters who wanted to hear substantive arguments, as Trump vowed to jail Clinton if he were elected.
&gt; 
&gt; “It might have been bordering on unconstitutional, maybe even something almost definitionally fascist,” Smith said of the declaration. “This, ‘If I get elected, I’m going to prosecute my political opponent,’ that’s never been done in the history of the United States.”
&gt; 
&gt; **Smith speculated that Trump’s debate performance was not one of a candidate attempting to win the general election, but perhaps of a person vying for a media network. “It’s all set up not as a guy who’s trying to win what’s left to get, but a guy who has another agenda,” he said**.

2016,"&gt; And now O’Reilly may have landed perhaps his biggest media scoop ever. Bigger than Brian Williams embellishing; bigger than his former boss’s sexual harassment scandal; bigger than the Rolling Stone rape story; bigger than Tronc-Gannett; bigger than O’Reilly’s own embellishments about his reportorial career. It’s so big that the Erik Wemple Blog fears that abridging it would do it an injustice. So let’s just leave O’Reilly’s own words as the authority on this matter. In an interview this morning with Fox News host Bill Hemmer, O’Reilly, ever the investigative reporter, said this in the context of the country’s reaction to last night’s second presidential debate:
&gt; 
&gt; *It’s a complicated situation, but I think everyone can agree — except for the media organizations that now have ordered their employees to destroy Trump — there’s at least three of them. And, I can’t say who they are right now because I don’t have it nailed down, but I am 100 percent convinced, and these media organizations have actually put out, ‘If you support Trump, your career is done done here.’ … News organizations have sent, not officially, but through the corporate grapevine that we don’t want anybody supporting Trump. If you study it, you can see which ones they are.*
&gt; 
&gt; Now this is the toughest form of reporting out there: There are no documents, no emails and no memos, apparently. Just “grapevine” communications, as O’Reilly terms them. Hats off to this cable news talent. In between promoting his new book, “Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan,” hosting his industry-leading primetime show and doing all the other things that the King of Cable News must do, O’Reilly has managed to gather the necessary human intelligence — that is, real-live sources high on the command chain at major U.S. media conglomerates — to aver on live television that perhaps the most sprawling media conspiracy in U.S. history is afoot.
&gt; 
&gt; This sort of reporting is why Bill O’Reilly is the King of Cable News. We’ve asked Fox News when O’Reilly will disclose the results of his investigation, because we can’t afford to miss it.

lol, WaPo's reporting on this is spot on. ",2016-10-10 20:10:43+00:00,d8mbutc,1.0,t3_56u31g,64.0,politics

2177,"&gt; The Obama administration said Friday it was ""confident"" that Russia was behind recent compromises of emails about upcoming US elections.
&gt;     
&gt; The announcement marks the first time the US has accused Russia of hacking into US political systems. Earlier in the week, the two countries broke off formal talks about a resolution in Syria.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,"" the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a joint statement.
&gt; ""The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,"" the statement added. ""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow -- the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.""
&gt; 
&gt; Officials told CNN that Friday's announcement follows long deliberations within the Obama administration as to whether and when to take this step. They have had confidence on the assessment for some time. Only question was whether to go public.
&gt; In addition, the collapse of the US-Russian relationship in other areas, such as Syria, played a role as well.",2016-10-07 20:17:24+00:00,d8icsmd,1.0,t3_56df2y,70.0,politics

2186,"&gt;David Letterman called Republican nominee Donald Trump “a person to be shunned” because of his comments about Mexican immigrants and a disabled reporter.

&gt;And if Letterman were still on the air, he wouldn’t go easy on him, he told The New York Times’s David Itzkoff in an interview published Friday.


&gt; “If I had a show, I would have gone right after him,” said Letterman. He took particular issue with Trump’s mockery of New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who is physically disabled. “I would have said something like, ‘Hey, nice to see you. Now, let me ask you: what gives you the right to make fun of a human who is less fortunate, physically, than you are?’”
&gt; 
&gt; “And maybe that’s where it would have ended,” he continued. “Because I don’t know anything about politics. I don’t know anything about trade agreements. I don’t know anything about China devaluing the yuan. But if you see somebody who’s not behaving like any other human you’ve known, that means something. They need an appointment with a psychiatrist.

No they didn't, the lawyers released their own letter. OPs article talks about it as well:

&gt; Four emails to Trump’s campaign seeking this IRS letter yielded no reply. In response to another inquiry, spokeswoman Hope Hicks pointed to another letter - one written by Sheri Dillon and William Nelson, tax attorneys representing Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; Dillon and Nelson wrote Trump’s “inordinately large and complex” returns have been “under continuous examination” by the IRS since 2002. The returns from 2002-2008 had been “closed administratively,” but the examination, they wrote, from “2009 year and forward are ongoing.”
&gt; 
&gt; It does not specify which years’ returns after 2009 are being examined.
&gt; 
&gt; The letter also said entries in the 2002-2008 returns -- even though those audits are closed -- could impact the returns currently under an open examination.  This likely means that Trump has so-called “carry-forwards” from those years that could affect his tax liability in 2009 and beyond. The New York Times over the weekend revealed that Trump’s personal tax returns declared a loss of $916 million in income in 1995, and that massive loss could be carried forward to lower or cancel out his income taxes for 18 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Their letter, dated March 7, 2016, does not specify if Trump’s 2015 returns are under audit. It is unlikely that his 2015 return would have been filed by early March, according to a tax expert, and even less likely that the IRS would have notified Trump of an audit by then.

&gt; “There’s no restriction by the IRS,” Koskinen testified, after being asked if there is any law that prevents a person from publicly disclosing an IRS audit notification.

2266,"&gt; Hillary talk about ""taco bowl engagement.

When you say Hillary do you actually mean DNC creative strategist Rebecca Christopher? And the email was referring to Trump's own racist tweet about Taco Bowls and Cinco De Mayo, not as a slur against Latinos. 

&gt; But, when it comes to the Latino-focused emails some say they are being taken out of context, and that the language in one of them actually references Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s racist comments.
&gt; 
&gt; On May 5, Trump tweeted: ""Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!"" The tweet, which included a photo of Trump giving a thumbs up, was widely criticized from the likes of ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush to former Mexican President Vicente Fox.
&gt; 
&gt; That day, the DNC used the controversial tweet to engage voters, publishing a video on social media highlighting Trump’s previous statements about Mexicans. ""There aren't enough tacos in the world to fix Trump's problems this Cinco de Mayo,"" the video concluded.
&gt; 
&gt; The email in question, sent May 6 by DNC creative strategist Rebecca Christopher, reads: ""Attached is a script for a new video we'd like to use to mop up some more taco bowl engagement.”
&gt; 
&gt; But that email was directly referencing Trump's tweet from the day before, and the video the DNC made in response to it - not Latinos themselves, a DNC spokesperson told Univision News. ""Trump is running an incredibly divisive campaign and it's our job to hold him accountable,"" the spokesperson said.

Although I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/democrats-cyberhack-russia-lies-227080) which talks about how security and intel people talk about how common it is to forge or ""enhance"" a document among other leaked documents for propaganda purposes.

&gt; Intelligence officials — including NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper — have long argued that data manipulation more broadly is a disturbing possibility, and potentially the next front in both cybercrime and the budding digital warfare between countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Last month, a bipartisan group of 32 national security experts at the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group warned of a specific type of fakery following the DNC hack, arguing that the suspected Russian hackers who struck the DNC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee could “salt the files they release with plausible forgeries.”

&gt;____

&gt; But hacking specialists say the most harmful information might not even be genuine.
&gt; 
&gt; “You may have material that’s 95 percent authentic, but 5 percent is modified, and you’ll never actually be able to prove a negative, that you never wrote what’s in that material,” CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch told POLITICO. “Even if you released the original email, how will you prove that it’s not doctored? It’s sort of damned if you do, damned if you don’t.""

&gt;___

ISIS got founded in 06 and moved into Syria before Obama came into office as well and Libya was going down the drain before Clinton took out Gaddafi. You're just twisting reality here. 

Haha Trump have met many foreign leaders? What are we talking now, three four? How is that even an argument. Have you actually listened to his speeches? They're extremely incoherent. He couldn't even last a 90 minute debate, poor thing.


&gt; If they don't pay.

&gt; Yeah don't kidnap us and make us look weak.

I'm happy that the world isn't run by people who think like you. 

&gt; You would rather have polite leaders fuck up the world than an impolite leader keep us from intervening in everything. That's the extent of your judgement here. Grow up.

Lol so you want to intervene in everything? Yes I rather have polite and smart leaders who's actually trying to do well in the world. It seems you're the one who's too emotional to discuss this in a proper manner.

2311,"&gt; The scrutiny of Trump’s philanthropic practices -- led by the Washington Post and now the subject of a New York state investigation -- began with the question of exactly how much he was giving to charity and expanded to various aspects of the Trump Foundation, the GOP nominee’s chief charitable vehicle. What emerged was a picture of a sloppily run, bare-bones operation that paid little regard to the laws and the etiquette surrounding charitable giving. Whether the foundation's poor practices were driven by cravenness or laziness is unclear, but it’s hard to believe that Trump took the foundation's philanthropic mission very seriously, charity law experts told TPM.
&gt; 
&gt; “Basically, he is not being charitable in order to be charitable. He is being charitable in order to enhance his personal and business interest. Sometimes that’s legal, sometimes it’s not,” said Lloyd Mayer, a Notre Dame Law School professor who teaches courses on not-for-profit organizations. “And he doesn’t seem to really care. Because if he cared, he would get lawyers who actually know ... about how much you can do and how much you can’t.”",2016-10-04 14:02:05+00:00,d8dir2l,1.0,t3_55tlnf,170.0,politics

He can't even make a coherent sentence longer than three words so how is he going to go up against foreign leaders and understand diplomacy on an international level? It will be a catastrophe in every way. 

&gt; but he understands power and stability

Is this a joke? Trump asked three times why the US can't use nuclear weapons during a one hour meeting, he says that he's not sure he will help other NATO allies, he would attack Iran if they teased American soldiers from their tiny boats, he gets upset if someone says he's not as rich as he claims to be and is obsessed with the size of his hands and the people saying they are small.

2320,"&gt; Observers in Europe are following America’s election campaigns with disbelief, a good portion of dismay and distinctly growing apprehension.
&gt; 
&gt; But for all the questions on Clinton’s vacillations on trade, the policies of a possible Trump administration spark something bordering on outright fear.
&gt; 
&gt; Some American friends tend to say that the United States is a country with strong institutions, constitutional separation of powers and clear limits on what a president can actually do.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but primarily on domestic issues.
&gt; 
&gt; Foreign-policy issues are a different matter. A stalwart Republican friend of mine, with vast experience on foreign policy and security issues, said, “I know the power of the Oval Office, and that man must never ever be allowed in there.” Whoever sits in the Oval Office is the commander in chief of the world’s mightiest military arsenal and can single-handedly take the country’s foreign policy in very different directions.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s fair to say that my friend’s feelings are widely shared across the world. Well, at least throughout the democratic West.
&gt; 
&gt; Some are starting, with reluctance, to consider what a Trump administration might actually mean. If disaster strikes, what are we supposed to expect on Jan. 20?
&gt; 
&gt; Trump’s trade policies are certainly scary, but apprehensions concerning these pale in comparison to the potential geopolitical consequences of him entering the Oval Office.
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump has evidently already looked into the soul of Vladimir Putin and concluded that he is a strong leader and a good man, and that anyhow all this talk about democracy and respecting rules isn’t anything for real men of their caliber**.
&gt; 
&gt; A good guess is that as president, he will try to achieve some super-Yalta deal with the Kremlin, saying that “Make Russia Great Again” is an honorable goal, concluding that might is better than right and agreeing that the quarreling Europeans in Brussels, or wherever, need not be taken too much into account.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever the content of such an approach**, Trump risks creating a new instability in Europe. And with the United Kingdom going into a frenzy on what to do after the Brexit vote, we are already in a somewhat fragile situation**. Without a common framework, the risk is that different countries will go in different directions, leaving an opportunity for the Kremlin to seize, make its moves and destabilize Europe even more.
&gt; 
&gt; What will happen then is anyone’s guess. Trump in the Oval Office might swing from appeasement to aggressiveness in seconds, or he might just walk away from it all, leaving the Kremlin to start to pick up pieces here and there. Either way, it would be very dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; And then there is, of course, the Middle East.
&gt; 
&gt; **Here the risk is obvious: Trump will provide a powerful boost to a Daesh that at the moment is starting to come under pressure** — from its own failings more than from the efforts of others. But moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would move sentiments among disenchanted Arab youth in the direction of militancy in a way hardly any other step could.
&gt; 
&gt; ___
&gt; 
&gt; Few strategic mistakes would be as profoundly grave as stoking a war between Islam and the West. But Trump’s own words indicates that this is what he, by design or by default, would actually do. While Trump can try building his walls around the United States, Europe is in a different situation. Beyond geographic proximity to the Middle East, Islam forms a part of our societies; any profound confrontation along these lines risks having profound effects across large parts of Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; The uncomfortable fact is that in the Middle East, a gradual but determined effort to overcome divisions, heal wounds, reform economies and build functioning and legitimate states throughout the region is the only possible way forward to avoid a combined Daesh/al-Qaeda 2.0 challenging us a decade from now.
&gt; 
&gt; A Trump presidency risks smashing any such strategy into smithereens.
&gt; 
&gt; No responsible European politician is coming out in public taking sides in the United States’ political affairs. That’s the way it should be between nations — we respect each other’s democratic choices. But in the chancelleries of the democracies of Europe, there is no doubt whatsoever what they fear.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe is already confronted with the revisionism in the East and the implosions and explosions in the South — but now there is a lingering feeling that the most dangerous developments could actually come from the West.

And this is coming from a former Prime Minister and Secretary of State of Sweden. (copied most of the text in case someone get stuck at the soft pay-wall). ",2016-10-04 12:54:43+00:00,d8dgbb3,1.0,t3_55tbb3,236.0,politics

2342,"&gt; An Associated Press report published Monday details the sexism female contestants and crew experienced from Trump while working on the show. Eight former “Apprentice” crew members told the AP Trump once compared a camerawoman’s beauty to his daughter’s, making repeated comments about the camerawoman’s behind.
&gt; 
&gt; A former contestant on the show, Poppy Carlig, said Trump once asked her to twirl in front of him so he could look at her figure.
&gt; 
&gt; “I don’t immediately jump to the conclusion that people are having bad intentions with what they are saying,” Carlig told the AP. “He said I reminded him of his daughter and I thought that was really touching because I know how much he values his family.”
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has made a slew of questionable comments about his daughter’s looks over the years, saying on ABC’s “The View” in 2006 that “if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps, I would be dating her.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father . . . “ Trump said to Rolling Stone in 2015.
&gt; 
&gt; In a 1999 interview with radio host Howard Stern, Trump said his daughter ― who was then 17 ― made him promise he would never date a woman younger than her.

2353,"&gt; In an interview published on Sunday, President Obama said that the nomination of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2008 marked the beginning of a shift in the Republican party that led to the rise of Donald Trump.

&gt; ""I see a straight line from the announcement of Sarah Palin as the vice-presidential nominee to what we see today in Donald Trump, the emergence of the Freedom Caucus, the tea party, and the shift in the center of gravity for the Republican Party,"" Obama told New York Magazine.

2459,"&gt; Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta hit back at Donald Trump on Twitter on Friday, offering what he called a “safety tip” in response to the Republican presidential nominee taking to Twitter in the early morning hours to call a former Miss Universe ""disgusting"" for a supposed ""sex tape.""
&gt; 
&gt; **“I'm almost @realDonaldTrump's age, so get the urge to get up in the middle of the night, but impt safety tip: don't reach for your phone,”** Podesta, who is 67, tweeted. Trump is 70.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump sent out a series of tweets in the wee hours of Friday morning attacking Alicia Machado, the 1996 winner of his “Miss Universe” pageant whom Trump once criticized, and continues to criticize, for gaining weight. During the nominees’ first debate on Monday, Hillary Clinton cited Trump’s behavior toward Machado as evidence of sexism, and Machado has since made TV and ad appearances on Clinton’s behalf.

&gt; 
&gt; “Substitute my husband’s face and body and you have the exact same person,” she said. “It makes me relive the crazy final days before my shooting when it was so confusing why he behaved the way he did.”
&gt; 
&gt; Donald Trump and his bombastic, truth-free persona is still baffling to many. But for one select group of people ― survivors of domestic violence ― Trump is immediately and intimately recognizable. 
&gt; 
&gt; He reminds them of the men who ruined their lives.
&gt; 
&gt; “Trump is triggering so many abuse and rape victims including me,” Angel Marie Russell wrote on Facebook after the first presidential debate. “His behavior is almost exact to my abusive exes. It’s terrifying. I can’t even watch him.”
&gt; 
&gt; While domestic abuse is often characterized as acts of physical violence, it’s more accurate to understand it as a cluster of specific behavioral tactics that abusers employ to control, intimidate and coerce victims. 

&gt; Many of the behaviors that Trump exhibited at the first presidential debate were strikingly similar to those used by abusers, said Rus Ervin Funk, a consultant for several domestic violence non-profits who has worked closely with men who batter.

&gt;_


&gt;This willingness to aggressively deny objective truths is a form of emotional abuse, called “gas-lighting.” Gas-lighting can cause victims to doubt their own memories and perceptions, and make it hard to distinguish fact from fiction.


Fortunately I haven't had any partners who are physically abusive but I've met several compulsive liars in my life and Trump's behavior is exactly like how those people behaved.

&gt; 
&gt; “They wanted to break the union, make the money in a hurry and give it to their activist shareholders, we used to call them raiders, and give it to their CEO.

2519,"They did, but not when Clinton was SoS and when they donated earlier it was to build a library. 

&gt; Using Trump’s Saudi Arabia example, Saudi Arabia shows up as having given between $10 million and $25 million since the foundation started. When it began in 1997, the foundation’s main goal was to build the Clinton presidential library, although it left open the option to ""engage in any and all other charitable, educational and scientific activities"" that nonprofits are allowed to do under federal law.
&gt; 
&gt; The Washington Post reported that Saudi Arabia gave about $10 million to build the library. (According to the Post, the Saudis gave a similar amount to the George H.W. Bush library.)  
&gt; 
&gt; After the library donation, the Saudis gave very little and stopped giving entirely during the time Clinton was secretary of state. She stepped down in early February 2013.
&gt; 
&gt; As a legal matter, Clinton was not a member of the foundation’s board until 2013, after she left the administration. She was a board member in 2014 when the Saudis gave again, but that amount would be much less than $10 million.
&gt; 
&gt; There were no Saudi donations while she was secretary.
&gt; 
&gt; Getting back to Saudi Arabia, working with them would necessarily be a part of any president’s job. Its donations might not make a difference, but there is no question that the foundation’s work creates a tangle of relationships.

Let's see what the Justice Department says. 

&gt; That prompted Democracy 21 and Campaign Legal Center to write a letter in July to the Justice Department, asking them to investigate whether the Trump campaign had ""engaged in knowing and willful violations"" of campaign finance laws, which could carry criminal penalties.
&gt; 
&gt; ""They have been put on notice that they are illegally soliciting contributions from foreign sources,"" said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.

2522,"I meant that Malmö got criminals like many other big city metropolis' and that Malmö is the first port when entering Sweden. I didn't say that everyone ends up there. They are now spread out all over the country (I'm talking about the most recent ones). 

&gt; As of 2015, Malmö had the fourth-highest proportion of foreign-born residents of any municipality in Sweden.[2] In addition to these figures, 14% of the population are foreign nationals

Compared to a city like NY:

&gt; According to a 2010 estimate, 21.7% of the population is foreign-born

The amount of foreign born in the entire US:

So it's less than in New York but it seems that you're trying to push these numbers to point to Muslims. Sweden have a big number of immigrants from all kinds of countries. The biggest immigration populations are from Finland, Iraq, Syria, Poland, Iran and former Yugoslavia. There's always been many immigrants coming here so this Syrian refugee situation is nothing new or nothing we have dealt with before.

I mean, sure even I say Malmö s a shithole but not because of the amount of immigrants living there. This is how [Malmö looks](https://www.google.se/search?q=malm%C3%B6&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8pMTxj67PAhXGjywKHV_8CNAQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=865#imgrc=_), does it look like a complete dump? 

Rosengård is a suburb which is particularly known to be rather shitty even for Sweden but it depends on what you compare with. I would rather live there any day if I would have to choose between an American ghetto and a Swedish ghetto. It would probably not even be called a ghetto if it it somehow got moved to the US. 

And about rapes in Sweden you can't really compare the amount of rapes to another country because we count them differently here by having a wider definition of what rape is, count every instance of rape as 1 offense instead of bunching together a long history of rapes, more rapes are being reported to police because of gender equality policy and legislation and improved handling of rape cases.


&gt; A frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), based on official statistics provided by each member state.[note 1] In 2012, Sweden had 66 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå).[230] This was unequivocally the biggest number reported to the UNODC in 2012.[231] However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult,[232][233][234][235] which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures.[231] It should also be noted that many countries do not report any rape statistics at all to the UNODC,[236] and some report very low numbers, despite studies that indicate otherwise.[237][238]
&gt; 
&gt; Comparison of selected countries' reported rape rates, 2012.

&gt; The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries.[232][235][239] Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape.[232][233][234] This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries.[233] For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider,[232][240][241][242] which led to a marked increase in reports.[243][244]

&gt;Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases.[232][244][245][246] For this reason, large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence.[232][233][234] An EU-wide survey on sexual violence against women, published the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) in 2014, showed Sweden was only third highest, below Denmark and Finland[247] and a previous assessment by Brå have placed Sweden at an average level among European nations.[233]

&gt; According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence.[247] This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships,[248] may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement,[234] and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality.[235][249]

2523,"Wait he actually asked the Mexican president for donations to his campaign? 

&gt; Vicente Fox, the former president of Mexico, received a plaintive fundraising request this weekend. ""You are our country's only hope,"" read the email, which urged him to make ""a generous contribution.""
&gt; 
&gt; The sender? Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; It was the second missive that Fox received to his personal email address this month seeking donations for the Trump campaign, according to a spokesman for the former president. On Sept. 9, Fox got a message from Trump that concluded, ""I know you won't let me down friend.""
&gt; 
&gt; This is puzzling for a number of reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; The first: Fox is no friend of Trump. In fact, he may be his most vocal foreign critic, having accused the real estate developer of being a ""false prophet"" and compared him to dictators. ""Campaigning in Mexico?"" Fox mocked Trump on Twitter after getting the first request for financial support. ""Running out of money and friends?""
&gt; 
&gt; But secondly, and even more importantly: It is illegal for an American candidate to solicit funds from foreign nationals. The law was brought to the attention of the Trump campaign back in June, when reports surfaced that lawmakers in Scotland, England, Iceland, Australia and other countries were getting a barrage of fundraising emails from the Trump campaign. Two campaign finance watchdog groups, Democracy 21 and the Campaign Legal Center, filed complaints in June with the Federal Election Commission.
&gt;

2524,"Yes I've been following this election very closely since the beginning of the year and I was a strong Sanders supporter before he dropped out. If he would be the candidate it would be amazing for everyone as I'm also is a democratic socialist I agree with him even more, but now the DNC is stuck with Clinton.  

I saw and read about everything you mentioned and If I could I would definitely still vote for Clinton anyway. I mean don't take this lightly, I was extremely suspicious of the entire email scandal and was shocked when nothing came out of the investigation. But even though all that I would still support Clinton over someone like Trump.

The reason to support Clinton is simple for me: She has tons of experience, she knows the right people and will actually employ good hard working people, even though she's had scandal after scandal she have never been guilty of anything that made it to court, unlike Trump and his scandals. But the best thing is that the Sanders campaign worked together on the democratic platform this year and I'm certain she will do everything to try to fulfill those policies. Consider the pressure she got on herself as the first female president, precisely as Obama had when he entered the oval office and he did great.

Trump on the other hand barely have any policies and he lies everyday about everything. Just read what he actually say sin a sentence and you will see that there is no substance, just repetition and slogans but no facts, policies or anything one can actually grasp. 

You know why many Europeans have a problem with Trump? It's because he reminds everyone of Hitler in the 30s. Not the gas chamber hitler but the dude who incited violence towards a specific group of people, who divided people because of racism and had an agenda to ""Make Germany Great Again"" and that's how he got huge amount of support because people were tired and poor and wanted change. 

But the main difference is the US has done great considering the state the country was after Bush W's presidency and the 2008 crash. Obama have made so many positive and progressive changes for a lot of people who really needed it. There is of course other issues which haven't been so good but electing Trump would only make it worse. Clinton would continue his path of leadership.

The people who like Trump here are mostly far right wing politicians or racist anti-immigrant groups (often backed by Russian interests). 

About Russia, of course everyone would want peace, even Clinton. But as we've seen over the years ever since Putin stepped into office things aren't as simple as ally or not ally. They work against American and European interests all the time. Even in Sweden they are messing with disinformation campaigns, disturbing NATO training exercises, airspace intrusions and flybys on our passenger airlines (this just happened today actually, again) and jet fighters. They routinely fly without transponders over our airspace to check our defense.

These things I mentioned above happened just last week. Further down Europe, in the Baltic states Russia are moving their troops closer and closer their borders everyday and are training them routinely for an invasion (yes they might just be training but it's very specific). They seized Crimea, they are working with Assad to bomb US backed rebels in Syria and they continuously hacking European governments and organisations and companies. We are already been in a cold war with them since the cold war ended and it seems they are trying to escalate things when they are doing these intrusions. Earlier this year there was also infrastructure sabotage done here which was most likely done by Russians. 

To praise Putin like Trump does is extremely concerning to me and many other Europeans who knows how much of a dictator he is. Imagine Trump looking up to him, trying to make America more like Russia. You can say goodbye to your civil liberties and the land of the free and be ruled by the guy who gets baited by a tweet from a journalists.

2525,"No I'm not saying that. Okay the three biggest cities in Sweden are Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö so those three cities have a lot of criminal elements like any other big city in any other country. We don't have a lot of crimes in Sweden overall compared to other countries so it can't be comparable to a country like the US or France or Germany which got huge populations. I have no idea of the demographics of those criminals in Malmö. It's probably a huge mix of different people. 
&gt; 
&gt; The number of cases of lethal violence in Sweden has remained at a relatively constant level over the last 30 years — around 100 cases per year — in spite of the population increase over the same period.[23][28] Studies of lethal violence in Sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter. This is because the Swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate. Many of these reported crimes turn out to be, in reality, suicides, accidents or natural deaths.[23][28] Despite this statistical anomaly, Sweden has an internationally low murder and homicide rate,[Note 2] with approximately 2 reported incidents of murder or manslaughter per 100,000 inhabitants in 2012.[29]
&gt; Lethal violence rarely takes place between persons who do not know each other; in 70 percent of cases, those involved knew each other. The risk of being attacked in a public place is extremely unlikely and this risk has not increased in recent years.[28] Around 75% of those murdered are men.[30]

2527,"&gt; So do you live in a nice place and aren't bothered because the crime is kept to ""the criminals"" ?
&gt; What kind of people live in southern sweden.

What I meant was, there's been a lot of talk by right wing media both here in Europe and the US that a city called Malmö in southern Sweden would be this Muslim no-go-zones-rape-and-crime-filled city because a lot of immigrants live there (because it's the first big city they see when they come to Sweden). 

But what I'm saying is that most of the crime there only affects other criminals, mostly regarding drug sales and territories. I have friends who live in Malmö and I've teased them because of the many crimes that are occurring there (not saying it's because of Muslims or anything just that it happens a lot there because it's connected with Denmark and the rest of the continent) but neither of them have been affected by these criminals. 

I live in Stockholm so I'm in a whole other place and I rarely see the Syrian/MENA immigrants except when I'm ""downtown"" and see some of them hanging around the main subway hub or watchamacallit. There are though some group of immigrant kids from Morocco that the government are trying to deport but even Morocco doesn't want to take them back, so they're like stuck here.

There are also many criminals in southern Sweden who causes a lot of problems but the ones affected by them are mostly other criminals. 

That Sweden would have more exported ISIS fighters just isn't correct.[ You can check the stats](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/iraq-and-syria-how-many-foreign-fighters-are-fighting-for-isil/) here and see that most of them are from central Europe, Russia and other MENA countries. 

[Here is another list of countries](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-terror-recruiting-europe-belgium-france-denmark-sweden-germany/). Sweden rates third place but you have to consider that we haven't had any big terrorist attack here except one incident in 2010 which killed 0 people and was done by some dude who had been living in Sweden since he was 10ish.

So why did so many immigrants from Sweden go fight for ISIS? Not sure actually but Sweden have always had a very liberal view on immigration because we like to help people in crisis all the way back to WWII and as far as I know it haven't been that much trouble in the long run. Sweden has in fact been voted as one of the best places to live in several times and the economy here is good even though the 2008 crash.

But crime statistics haven't suddenly shot up massively and it's pretty much within the yearly stats. 

But there hasn't been huge crime waves, terrorist attacks or a mass rape thing as right wing media would like it to be. 

What do you mean with ""Sweden, a land of formerly open borders to refugees""? Sweden took in that many refugees because no other country in Europe wanted to help them. The majority of them are not fighting for ISIS but are just escaping war in Syria. 

Trump opposing them are definitely helping them, they love his hateful rhetoric because like I said it divides people further. That's why far right wing (the nazis) media loves to push that narrative so more people will become hateful and racists.

&gt;  **Laith Alkhouri, counterterrorism analyst and co-founder of the threat intelligence firm FlashPoint**:

&gt;According to Alkhouri, the jihadist supporters' desire to see Trump become president is two prong. One one hand, they think he will weaken the United States -- politically, economically and internationally -- and thus is a figure to be mocked. On the other, Trump has also made promises to be more aggressive with the Islamic State -- such as “I would hit ISIS so hard you wouldn’t believe it” -- that they believe will drive home their us-against-the-West messaging.

&gt;“They believe that while Trump is running for the highest office in the world potentially, he is somebody that they can mock, they can joke about, and in some manner they believe that this guy who, if anything, if anything, is advancing their agenda, instead of going against their agenda,” Alkhouri said. “That is pretty disconcerting. People talk about ISIS not releasing anything about Trump, well clearly ISIS followers, or at least many of them, believe that Trump is the guy they would want to see in the White House.”


&gt; **Dov Zakheim**, a conservative foreign policy adviser, asserts that Trump’s rhetoric would be used as a recruiting tool.
&gt; 
&gt; “If he gets elected it could be a rallying cry for ISIS and al Qaeda and all these extremist groups,” Zakheim said. “They could say ‘see they really do hate you, and if you are Muslim and you think you can get along in the West, you are kidding yourself. “
&gt; 
&gt; Zakheim said that Trump “didn't create ISIS but he's a racist,” and ISIS “will exploit any vehicle they can exploit.“
&gt; 
&gt; **Mara Revkin**, a PhD student at Yale who has studied ISIS governance, told TPM that in her interviews with both current Islamic State supporters and defectors, Trump is viewed as the ultimate enemy, someone who may push the U.S. into a ground war in the Middle East.
&gt; 
&gt; Revkin–who has traveled a total of four times to Turkey and Iraq this year for her research– said that one Syrian Islamic State defector told her in Turkey that ISIS uses Trump in their propaganda because he is the “perfect enemy.” Revkin added that the Arabic might translate more directly as ""excellent enemy.""

2605,"&gt;Two senior Democratic lawmakers with access to classified intelligence on Thursday accused Russia of “making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,” a charge that appeared aimed at putting pressure on the Obama administration to confront Moscow.

&gt;The jointly issued statement from Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam B. Schiff — Californians who are the ranking Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees, respectively — described recent cyber penetrations of the Democratic National Committee and other U.S. political entities as intrusions that were likely directed by Russian President Vladi­mir Putin.



&gt;Speaking this week at a public event hosted by The Washington Post, Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr., cited a long history of Russian efforts to influence elections abroad, and said that “it shouldn’t come as a big shock to people” that Moscow might seek to use cyber capabilities for that purpose.



&gt;White House officials have repeatedly insisted that they are awaiting the outcome of a formal FBI investigation, even though U.S. intelligence are said to have concluded with “high confidence” that Russia was responsible for the DNC breach and other attacks.

2671,"&gt; Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton affirmed the importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance on Monday but reiterated their contrasting positions on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement.
&gt; 
&gt; In a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Abe and Clinton stated their respective “known positions” on the 12-nation TPP, a senior Japanese official said, declining to comment further.
&gt; 
&gt; Abe is believed to have called for a speedy implementation of the yet-to-be ratified pact, while Clinton is thought to have reiterated her opposition to the deal, a position she adopted during her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination despite having promoted it as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.
&gt; 
&gt; Abe and Clinton also discussed regional issues such as North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, maritime security including China’s increased territorial claims in the South and East China seas, terrorism and women’s empowerment, according to the official who did not provide details of the talks.
&gt; 
&gt; Abe told Clinton that given the severity of the security environment in the Asia-Pacific region, “I would like to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance so it can contribute to the region and the world as an ‘alliance of hope,’” the official said.
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton was quoted by the official as saying the Japan-U.S. relationship is important for the peace and prosperity of the region and the world.

&gt;The 50-minute meeting at a New York hotel came at the request of Clinton, who will face Republican Party nominee Donald Trump in November’s presidential election.

&gt;If elected, Clinton is expected to continue Obama’s policy of a strategic “rebalance” or “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region.

&gt;Abe has yet to receive a request for a meeting from Trump, according to the Japanese official.",2016-09-20 20:24:33+00:00,d7v2yzp,1.0,t3_53pf22,31.0,politics

2682,"A weakening NATO will lead to a more aggressive Russia. These past years should be evidence enough of this. They are doing more air space intrusions, intercepting and buzzing NATO allies airplanes/aircraft carriers, military movements along Baltic countries borders, bombed US backed rebels in Syria and they have of course seized Crimea. 

This past year there's been suspected infrastructure sabotage in Sweden and what seems to be Russian submarine presense in the Swedish archipelago. [Today news broke out about Russian interference with NATO military exercises in northern Sweden](http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/norrbotten/misstankt-ryskt-spionage-okar-i-norra-sverige) (Right click to translate page).

&gt; Several reports of suspected Russian spy and outreach activities directed against individual soldiers in northern Sweden have been revealed recently. Now, the Armed Forces encourages employees to be extra vigilant.

&gt; Each week there is a security incident that occurred in very large or small kind, says Mikael Frisell, head of the Military Region North.
&gt; 
&gt; It is mainly about suspected espionage at the military protected objects and the military activities such as exercises. But also for outreach activities directed against soldiers and squad leaders via social media or a close encounter in real life, says Colonel Mikael Frisell, who heads the Military Region North and lists some examples:

* Photos on a vehicle with a lot of antennas that have been related to certain activities Armed Forces conducted

* An individual with an identity that did not come from Sweden who has been in an ""incorrect"" place

* Contacting soldiers through social media

* Official visit of officers

* A Russian aircraft, hired by a German research team to use in an EU project, stood at Kiruna airport without permission. According to Mikael Frisell the plane flew over Armed Forces' operations. The incident occurred in March-April this year.

&gt; Threatened at the pub

&gt; According to information provided to SVT News Norrbotten also has **a NATO officer has been threatened by Russians at a restaurant visit during a NATO exercise in Lulea. They shall also have shown photos of his family and demanded specific information about NATO exercise**.

&gt; Sharpen vigilance

&gt; The Armed Forces have now gone out internally among the staff with a call for extra vigilance against suspected Russian espionage. And in the future it may also be the case with a telephone tip line where the public can call if they saw anything unusual or suspicious about the military protected objects or military activities, as recently introduced in southern Sweden.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone must begin to realize that this is how it looks now, this actually takes place in Sweden and we must take it very seriously, says Mikael Frisell.

I think the US should definitely stay in NATO and Trump's mistrust of the organization and praising of Putin should be worrying considering his timing coincides with a more aggressive Russia. ",2016-09-20 16:01:01+00:00,d7uq3wy,1.0,t3_53nwut,1796.0,politics

I used to think that yeah she voted for the Iraq war so she's a responsible too! But the more I read about the actual resolution the better I understood that it's not as simplistic like you either voted for or against going to war.

&gt; **Myth #1**: The 2002 Congressional Resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq, on which Hillary Clinton and a large majority of U.S. Senators voted yes, gave George W. Bush “carte blanche” to pursue war against Saddam Hussein.
&gt; 
&gt; **False!** In fact exactly the opposite is true: While that Resolution did indeed authorize President Bush, under strict requirements of the 1973 War Powers Act, to use force, Section 3(b) of the Act also required that sanctions or diplomacy be fully employed before force was used, i.e. force was to be used only as “necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,” and to do so only upon the President certifying to Congress that “diplomatic or other peaceful means” would be insufficient to defang Saddam.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite those legal conditions, the following year we were at war—and millions of us were astonished that the Bush Administration, running roughshod over Congress’s requirements, hadn’t given more time for U.N. inspectors to complete their job of searching for weapons of mass destruction.

&gt; Recent polls suggest he’s not even close.
&gt; 
&gt; And unless Trump can boost his performance on the outskirts of cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio — particularly in the more affluent suburbs where middle-class women and college-educated white voters have eyed him askance — he risks being overwhelmed by the large Democratic margins delivered by the nearby big cities.
&gt; 
&gt; “He’s played the white, working-class speech,” said Terry Madonna, a veteran Pennsylvania pollster, referring to the message Trump has aimed at working class white men in economically struggling communities. “He’s not really made an appeal to [suburban] individuals.”
&gt; 
&gt; The suburbs, where 47 percent of all votes were cast in 2012, went narrowly for Romney after voting narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008.

2835,"&gt; After five years of perpetuating racist lies about Obama’s birthplace, the Republican presidential nominee is finally conceding that the president was indeed born in Hawaii. But Trump still hasn’t acknowledged that he fueled the birther movement, nor has he disclosed what “evidence” he believes his investigators allegedly found. 
&gt; 
&gt; Trump made the claim about the detectives in April 2011, during an interview with NBC’s “Today” show.
&gt; 
&gt; “I have people that actually have been studying it and they cannot believe what they’re finding,” Trump told host Meredith Vieira. 
&gt; 
&gt; “You have people now down there searching, I mean in Hawaii?” she asked.
&gt; 
&gt; “Absolutely,” he replied. “And they cannot believe what they’re finding.”
&gt; 
&gt; When ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos asked him about the investigators later that month, Trump refused to say what they had found. 
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s none of your business right now,” he said. “We are going to see what happens.” 
&gt; 
&gt; “Never was curious once, because he’s not a liar. If they found something, it will come out. The time isn’t right, and guess what? Mr. Trump does what he wants and he’s not going to do it on our time,” she replied.
&gt; 
&gt; The time apparently still isn’t right. More than five years after he first made the claim, Trump hasn’t provided any proof that his probe actually happened.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump press secretary Hope Hicks did not reply to an email asking for specific information on who the investigators were, when they went to Hawaii and what they found. 
&gt; 
&gt; While Trump and his campaign is mum on the alleged investigation, at least one Hawaiian official has disputed the claim, The New York Times reported in July: 
&gt; 
&gt; Dr. Alvin Onaka, the Hawaii state registrar who handled queries about Mr. Obama, said recently through a spokeswoman that he had no evidence or recollection of Mr. Trump or any of his representatives ever requesting the records from the Hawaii State Department of Health.

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/trumps-biggest-lie-the-size-of-his-twitter-following

&gt; Just how many fake followers does Trump really have? Well, it’s difficult to determine, and the results are all over the place. According to the site Status People, which tracks how many Twitter accounts are bots, inactive, or real, only 21 percent of Trump’s Twitter followers are real, active users on the platform. The rest are either bots, dead bots, or real people who no longer log into Twitter. By Status People’s estimate, only two million of the supposed 10.3 million followers that Trump bragged about last week are actually listening to him. Another estimate from The Atlantic, which employed a service called BotOrNot, suggested that Trump has a lot more real followers, and that bots only account for between 3.4 and 22.4 percent of his active followers. And yet another service, Twitter Audit, suggests that 41 percent of Trump’s Twitter followers are fake. As of Wednesday, Twitter Audit estimates that 6,223,450 of his followers are real, and 4,306,922 are fake. (Again, Clinton is not far behind.)

&gt;But if you really want to see fake, you have to look at all the accounts that retweet Trump. If you go back through his timeline, you will see that at around the same time last year, Trump was averaging just a few dozen retweets a day on a typical tweet, and 100 to 200 likes on a tweet. Now, even his most mundane tweet gets several thousand retweets and 10,000 to 20,000 likes. Or, if you want to see how real these followers really are, just scroll through Trump’s Twitter account. You will see a lot of real people who talk about the Lord, and a lot more who are completely made up.
&gt; 
&gt; So next time he sends a note saying, “Thank you! 22.4+ million followers!,” know that half of the people he is talking about are just figments of Donald Trump’s imagination.

Even though I don't agree with the US sales of weapons to Saudi, I can understand the reasoning behind it.

[Regarding the 2010 sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_AWACS_Sale#US_arms_sale_to_Saudi_Arabia.2C_2010):


&gt;  ""This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region. We're paying attention to the needs of our allies and what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran. One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong.

[Regarding the 2016 sale](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-08-12/lawmakers-worry-who-saudi-arabia-would-kill-with-115b-us-arms-deal):

&gt; ""This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic regional partner which has been and continues to be a leading contributor of political stability and economic progress in the Middle East,"" the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in its announcement of the latest sale proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., said he strongly disagrees with Murphy, suggesting that lethal aid from the United States to Saudi Arabia has been a vital check on Iran's expanding influence.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The Iranian backed Houthis were about to take over Yemen, so I suggest he reevaluate,"" McCain said of Murphy. ""We wouldn't do anything about it, so the Saudis did.""

Saudi is one of very few ME allies of the US which helps to maintain a certain political stability (even though Iraq and Syria is in shambles) in the area. So the reasoning is that even though their awful record of many human rights issues they are the only ones wanting to work closely with the US. 

Also, this isn't a partisan issue, both Reagan and Bush sold weapons to Saudi as well. This is a long term plan of maintaining a diplomatic relationship and presence in the Middle East.

And I don't think it's fair to say that Clinton is behind or alone complicit in these sales when it's also the Defense Secretary and then getting the approval of Congress.

2922,"&gt; The former secretary of state appears to be baiting Trump with her decision to meet with foreign leaders during the U.N. General Assembly.
&gt; 
&gt; Hillary Clinton says she's planning to meet with several foreign leaders during the U.N. General Assembly next week.
&gt; 
&gt; Your move, Donald Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; When it comes to establishing an international profile, there's no bigger platform for a U.S. presidential candidate than the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. This year's White House race, featuring the largely untested, less-than-diplomatic Republican nominee, has injected a dash of uncertainty to the gathering in New York.
&gt; 
&gt; Not only can Clinton and Trump use the event to give themselves a statesman-like glow, they also can send a signal about their foreign policy priorities in whom they choose to see. And international leaders are unlikely to reject the opportunity to meet with the potential next leader of the world's lone superpower, even if he's insulted their countries.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, ""there’s so much protocol, so much going on. It's so easy to look stupid,"" said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""The U.N. General Assembly is the type of event where you could walk into a bar and run into a foreign minister from a small country who can't get into the event that you just went to. It's sort of created to humiliate even the most august people.""",2016-09-14 20:16:17+00:00,d7mvmvg,1.0,t3_52shaq,74.0,politics

2927,"Because if both parents can use their paternal leave they can share the family load at home and go to work. The children would get a good connection with not only their mom but their dad as well. Maybe the mom want to work as she has a higher income than the dad so then the dad can stay home and take care of the child after some time. 

The mommy track discrimination comes from businesses that doesn't want an employee that they have to pay while not being at work. This is a systematic issue of discrimination in the US. Not just towards moms but dads in companies who have paternity leave because it's looked down upon for some reason.

In many countries in EU parents get at least 14 weeks off (+ 2 weeks free before expected birth and at least 2 weeks after birth). 

In Sweden for example both parents have the right to be free from work (payed) until the child is 18 months old. They can split that time between them and more and more dads are using their right to take out paternity leave. In 2013 25% of all dads used their paternity leave so it's not considered strange anymore. This benefits the child a lot by having a stronger connection with both parents instead of only the mother and it gives both parents a chance to get back to work and think about their careers.

2932,"Why don't you want to demand more? To get up to date with other first world countries?  Why is this utterly slow progress enough?

&gt; Instead of helping working mothers, as is apparently intended, Trump’s plan would do them harm: At home, they’d be burdened with more childcare. At work, they’d be discriminated against because employers would likely set them on the “mommy track,” ratcheting back expectations for women who are assumed to be more devoted to the home sphere.

&gt; Trump’s plan even includes a credit for stay-at-home mothers, but not for stay-at-home fathers. That such a man exists wouldn’t even cross the Trumpian mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Leaving men out quite obviously hurts fathers ― who want to be involved in their own lives ―  and their families. It particularly insults gay men who become fathers.

&gt; Leaving men out damages the families that need them at crucial times. But it’s also super terrible for women in the workplace. Not just mothers but little girls dreaming of their future or young fresh-faced college graduates plotting out their careers or families.

3005,"But did Trump actually create those 34,000 jobs or did he just acquire the companies where those jobs already existed? Obama on the other hand created over 14 million jobs.

&gt; The answer that mentions the Trump Shuttle raises an important point. If I acquire a company, say the Eastern Shuttle, that employs 1,000 workers, did I “create” 1,000 jobs? You may say yes. But let’s say after I buy the company I cut the workforce by 200 jobs, leaving 800 employed workers. Did I create 1,000 jobs or 800 jobs? Or did I simply destroy 200 jobs, because that’s how the unemployment figures would count them (after all, these people had jobs before the acquisition and didn’t afterwards). Now let’s say I buy a company with 1,000 manufacturing jobs and I subsequently offshore 500 of them to Mexico. Did I create or destroy jobs? Finally, if I start a company selling steaks or giving real estate classes and subsequently shut them down, did I create jobs or did I end up with net zero job creation because I ultimately destroyed all the jobs I created?
&gt; 
&gt; So, how many jobs did Trump truly create?
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t dispute the fact that Trump’s business activities create employment, not only within the Trump Organization but also at the contractors and vendors that participate in his various.

3006,"He's done pretty much though. But there's always room for improvement sure.

**Restoring Economic Security**: According to the White House, American businesses have added over 14 million jobs. This job growth has helped cut the African American unemployment rate in half – from 16.8% in March 2010 to 8.3% in December 2015, its lowest level since September 2007. The African American unemployment rate has fallen by more than the overall unemployment rate in the past few years, and is further below its pre-recession level than any other racial or ethnic group.
**
Helping the Long-Term Unemployed Get Back to Work**: The Administration has taken steps to help more of the long-term unemployed get back to work, around one-quarter of whom are African American. The president unveiled a set of “best practices” being taken by leading employers — including over 80 members of the Fortune 500 and over 20 members of the Fortune 50 — around recruiting and hiring the long-term unemployed to remove some of the barriers that make it harder for them to navigate the hiring process. The Department of Labor awarded nearly $170 million in “Ready to Work Partnership” grants to support the best models for partnerships between employers, non-profits and the job training system, to help train and connect the long-term unemployed to work.

**Providing Comprehensive Healthcare**: President Obama’s victories in Congress for comprehensive health care coverage, as well as his win in the Supreme Court, meant that many African Americans benefited. By March 2015, over 16 million Americans had enrolled in Obamacare, reports NBC News. Because of Obamacare, the rates of uninsured Americans have fallen to 11.9% after being at 16% when President Bush left office. Over 3 million poor Americans, including hundreds of thousands of African Americans in the south would be covered if not for Republican governors blocking the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.

**Championing Criminal Justice Reform and Fair Policing**: President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010.  This narrowed the penalty between crack and powder cocaine from 1:10 to 1:18.  In 2014, President Obama established a task force on policing and in 2015, he rolled back the use of certain military equipment by local police –a Black Lives Matter related demand. During the Obama presidency, the Department of Justice has investigated several police departments, including Ferguson, Cleveland, and Philadelphia, under former Attorney General Eric Holder and current Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

**Helping Americans Keep Their Homes**: African American families were particularly hard-hit by the housing crisis and were the victims of predatory lending. The president took action to help homeowners, including expanding access to refinancing – allowing responsible borrowers to save an average of $3,000 per year. The Administration also took measures to allow homeowners behind on their payments to modify their mortgages to avoid foreclosure – with more than 1.5 million borrowers having received permanent modifications through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), the Administration’s cornerstone foreclosure prevention program, and millions more receiving private modifications that were modeled off of HAMP.

3007,"&gt; Obama first made a joke of Trump’s admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, an adversary of Obama’s throughout his presidency, but then sought to shame Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; “I have to do business with Putin. I have to do business with Russia. That’s part of foreign policy. But I don’t go around saying, ‘that’s my role model,’” Obama said of the authoritarian former KGB agent.
&gt; 
&gt; “Could you imagine Ronald Reagan idolizing somebody like that?”
&gt; 
&gt; Obama mocked the Republican and novice candidate as a fraudulent champion for the working class, suggesting that the businessman is merely exploiting this year’s populist voter mood after a lifetime of gilded circumstances.
&gt; 
&gt; “I keep on reading this analysis that Trump’s got support from like workin’ folks,” Obama said. “Really? This is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people.”
&gt; 
&gt; But he seemed most energized when criticizing Trump. He left little doubt that he is on a personal mission to defeat the man who rose to political prominence as the celebrity proponent of the false “birther” theory that Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore not legitimately president.
&gt; 
&gt; “This guy’s suddenly going to be your champion? I mean, he spent most of life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could, and now this guy’s gonna be the champion of working people. Huh?” Obama said.
&gt; 
&gt; “I mean, he wasn’t going to let you on his golf course. He wasn’t going to let you buy in his condo. And now suddenly this guy’s gonna be your champion?”
&gt; 
&gt; He drew laughs when he took aim at Trump’s charitable foundation, noting, as The Washington Post reported, that he “took money other people gave to his charity and then bought a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. He had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version.”

3024,"If you actually read the article you would see that it's a bit more complicated than what you make it out to be:

&gt; Finally, Hillary didn't ""free"" the defendant in the case. Instead, the prosecuting attorney agreed to a plea deal involving a lesser charge that carried a five-year sentence, of which the judge suspended four years and allowed two months credit of time already served towards the remaining year:
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, according to Newsday it was the complainant and her mother who pushed the state to make a quick plea deal rather than have the former go through the ordeal of a court trial, with the mother actively interfering in the investigation to bring about that result:
&gt; 
&gt; The victim says it was her mother, who had recently been abandoned by her husband, who pushed for a quick plea deal to avoid the humiliation of having her daughter testify in open court. The mother, who died several years ago, was so eager to end the ordeal she coached her daughter’s statements and interrupted interviews with police, Sgt. Dale Gibson [the department’s lead investigator] recalls.
&gt; 
&gt; “We both wanted it to be over with,” the victim told Newsday. “They kept asking me the same questions over and over. I was crying all the time.”
&gt; 
&gt; Even now, that outcome is not unusual for violent criminal charges: 2014 statistics show that 97% of criminal cases (including rape) are resolved by plea bargain, and only 3% go to trial. The ratio of plea bargains to trials was similar in 1970 [PDF].
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, that 1975 criminal case came before the widespread adoptions of rape shield laws that now protect rape victims in court from some forms of questioning. A case brought in 1975 would have been subject to much weaker legal protection for the accuser than today.
&gt; 
&gt; As Hillary Clinton said while looking back on the case during a 2014 interview for Mumsnet, ""When you're a lawyer you often don't have the choice as to who you will represent. And by the very nature of criminal law there will be those you represent you don't approve of. But, at least in our system, you have an obligation. And once I was appointed I fulfilled that obligation.""

Clinton reluctantly took on the case, which ended with a plea bargain for the defendant, and later chuckled about some aspects of the case when discussing it years later.
&gt;

3065,"&gt; The Russian government routinely censors media organizations, and there are few independent news sources in the country. At least 34 journalists have been murdered in Russia since Putin took office in 2000, many by government or military officials, according to data from the Committee to Protect Journalists and the Glasnost Defense Foundation, two organizations that track journalist deaths in Russia.
&gt; 
&gt; While in Congress, then-Rep. Mike Pence was a strong critic of Vladimir Putin’s treatment of journalists in Russia
&gt; 
&gt; Pence’s letter singled out the case of Paul Klebnikov, editor-in-chief of Forbes Russia magazine, as “a tragic example of the kind of murder of journalists that have gone unresolved under President Putin’s Administration.”
&gt; 
&gt; Klebnikov, who had spent years investigating corruption and graft in Russia, was shot and killed in Moscow in 2004, after his magazine published a list of the wealthiest Russians. He was “the twelfth reporter to be killed in mafia-style assassinations in direct reprisals for their journalism in Russia since President Putin came to power in 2000, and not one of the murderers has been brought to justice,” according to the letter. 
&gt; 
&gt; “**Mike always associated himself closely with Ronald Reagan, and to now see him and Donald Trump lauding Vladimir Putin as he invades his neighbors and crushes democracy and dissent in Russia is appalling**,” the statement continued. “**Vladimir Putin hasn’t changed from 2006, but unfortunately it seems that Mike Pence has, and he is no longer willing to condemn the Russian strongman.**”

3093,"&gt; Mike Pence declined to call former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke “deplorable” in an interview on Monday, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he’s “not in the name-calling business.”
&gt; 
&gt; Pence was criticizing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for saying “half” of Donald Trump’s supporters belonged in a “basket of deplorables” when Blitzer noted that the campaign has attracted some support from white nationalists, including Duke.
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m not really sure why the media keeps dropping David Duke’s name,” Pence said. “Donald Trump has denounced David Duke repeatedly, we don’t want his support and we don’t want the support of people who think like him.
&gt; 
&gt; “You would call him a ‘deplorable?'” Blitzer asked.
&gt; 
&gt; “No, I’m not in the name-calling business Wolf. You know me better than that,” Pence said. “What Hillary Clinton did Friday night is shocking.”

First KKK and now David Duke, when will the Trump campaign get any backbone? Or are they afraid to tell it like it is? It's ""shocking"" when someone calls out bigots and racists and homophobes but you can't say a Neo-Nazi, racists, former Imperial Wizard of the KKK (lol), Stormfront author and a holocaust denier is deplorable? Weak Pence. Really fucking weak. 

EDIT: My guess to why he wouldn't call David Duke deplorable is because 

1. He's a coward and is afraid of losing their racist base, 

2. If he would say that David Duke is ""deplorable"" that would justify what Clinton said last week which would ruin the Trump campaign's current narrative of the week that it was so bad of Clinton to say that. ",2016-09-12 21:49:24+00:00,d7k51j7,1.0,t3_52gwst,45.0,politics

Well he wasn’t. He was — I thought he was very professional, I have to be honest. I think he’s been treated very unfairly, but they all said that I won, and what they’re doing is they’re gaming the system so that when I go into the debate, I’m gonna get — be treated very, very unfairly by the moderators.”

So most people are saying Lauer went easy on Trump, yet Trump says that most people say Trump won? Huh? This will be how Trump sneaks out of the debates, by blaming everybody else it's rigged against him.

Nobody wants a war with Russia, but considering that Trump is pussy whipped by Putin a Trump presidency would lead to Russia being even more aggressive in these parts of the world.

3172,"2.9 billion is far from his stated 10 billion and most likely a like. 

Sure he got 2.9 billion locked up in real estate and various assets, but not something he can use for his campaign otherwise he wouldn't be stealing so much money now.

But there's also this:
&gt; 

 &gt;At least that's what Timothy O'Brien — the one man in journalism who's actually seen the tax returns — seems to be saying.
&gt; When Tim O’Brien wrote a 2005 biography of Trump, here’s what he found:


&gt; 
&gt; Three people with direct knowledge of Donald’s finances, people who had worked closely with him for years, told me that they thought his net worth was somewhere between $150 million and $250 million. By anyone’s standards this still qualified Donald as comfortably wealthy, but none of these people thought he was remotely close to being a billionaire.
&gt; 
&gt; But it did matter to Trump. He sued O’Brien for $5 billion for defamation. (The case was dismissed.) At the time, Trump said his net worth was at least $2.7 billion
&gt; 
&gt; He quite literally just takes things everyone agrees he owns and estimates their worth as much higher, without saying how, specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, he says his golf courses are worth $2 billion, using an undisclosed methodology. Bloomberg put the number at $570 million, based on the valuation of similar properties.
&gt; 
&gt; The Trump brand alone, which brings in licensing and branding fees, is worth more than $3 billion, he says. But that seems exaggerated for something that only brought in $32-55 million in royalties in 2014. 
&gt; 
&gt;  He claims “income” of $557 million in 2015, but Crain’s Aaron Elstein reported that Trump got a state tax break for households with incomes less than $500,000. Trump and state officials said the tax break was a mistake.

So using his Trump brand as an example, Trump says it's worth 3 billion while it's probably worth about 30-60 million. That's a pretty big exaggeration if you ask me and does probably apply all over the board of Trump's assets. 

EDIT: [Added link](http://www.vox.com/2016/5/14/11671650/how-rich-is-trump)

&gt; 
&gt; Yet that's exactly what O'Brien did in a July 2015 column that echoed the anonymous sources' claim and added new evidence that Trump is overestimating his net worth:
&gt; 
&gt; My lawyers deposed Donald for two days during the litigation, and we covered a range of interesting subjects. Among the documents discussed was a **Deutsche Bank assessment that pegged Donald’s net worth at $788 million in 2005**. At the time, Donald was telling his bankers and casino regulators that he was worth $3.6 billion; he was telling me he was worth $5 billion to $6 billion.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you ""always been completely truthful in your public statements about your net worth,"" my attorneys asked Donald. ""I try,"" was his reply. When they asked him about how he calculated his net worth, he noted that the figure ""goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings."" Later he added that ""even my own feelings affect my value to myself.""",2016-09-11 22:26:12+00:00,d7is7pl,17.0,t1_d7ironq,731.0,politics

[Top 10 Reasons To Doubt Trump Is Even A Billionaire](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/top-ten-reasons-to-doubt-trump-is-even-a-billionaire).

&gt; Nobody who is in the business of estimating the wealth of the extremely rich believes Trump is worth anywhere near $10 billion. On the high end is Forbes which pegs the number at $4.5 billion. Bloomberg puts the number at $2.9 billion. Fortune says he's worth $3.9 billion. These estimates are all dramatically lower than what Trump claims. 

[IS DONALD TRUMP NOT REALLY A BILLIONAIRE?](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/donald-trump-net-worth)

&gt; The Republican’s recent moves suggest he has something to hide.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody is doubting that the presumptive Republican nominee is exceptionally well-off. Several tax experts and fellow rich people told Politico that, even in the absence of seeing his tax returns, they were willing to bet that **Trump was technically a low-grade billionaire**.

&gt;But it’s possible, many say, that Trump pockets far less profit than his business revenues suggest. **The fact that he’s sold several of his assets—including up to $7 million in fund assets and $9 million in individual securities—to cover his campaign debt suggests that he probably doesn’t have enough cash on hand to easily cover the costs of his campaign outright**. 

&gt;That’s not something one would expect from a man who claims he is worth “in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS” (the capitalization is Trump’s). **In addition, the real estate mogul has added over $50 million in debt to his ledger, Politico reports, putting his total debt somewhere between $315 million and $500 million, and possibly more**.

***King of Debt***!

[And again Mark Cuban comes to the rescue](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/alleged-billionaire):

&gt; “I think he’s good at real estate; I do give him a lot of credit there. I think he’s good at branding real estate,” he said. “**I don’t think he’s very good at brands for non–real estate products. And, to me, it’s more a reflection of desperation**.

&gt; **“So when you’re putting your name on steaks, and you’re putting your name on water, you’re putting your name on playing cards, you’re putting your name on all this nonsense, right? You’re not gonna make big bucks, no matter what. It’s not like Trump Steaks were gonna make him $100 million. It’s not like it was gonna make him $5 million.”**
&gt; 
&gt; “I asked, ‘What the hell are you doing?’ **Are you that desperate for money?’ Seriously,**” Cuban said, saying Trump couldn’t say no if someone was going to write him a check.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s not even close, I do,” Cuban said. “Before all the Trumpians jump on me on who has more money, the reason I know is when you file your federal election campaign reports, you have to list all your cash and liquid securities and bonds. **You have to list them one by one. So we know without any question that as of May 27, Donald doesn’t have more than $165 million in cash and securities and bonds**.

[As Warren Buffet said speaking about Trumps tax releases](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/hillary-clinton-nebraska.html): 

&gt; He (Trump) is not afraid of the IRS, he's afraid because of you!

Meaning Trump is afraid of showing his real taxes because he probably doesn't even pay taxes and he's not this self-proclaimed billionaire but he's just afraid to show them which is really lame.

I do however not have any obligation to be objective in what I post. But on the topic of why I would advice anyone to vote for Hillary instead of Trump:

* She will have competent people around her.

* She has the political experience and knowledge of how diplomacy works

* Bernie's campaign team helped out to write Clinton's platform

* She has a long history of actually helping people

* She wouldn't be impulsive like Trump would be

* She has severe pressure on her to do good in the White House. Especially considering how liked Obama is and because of the pressure on her as the first female president. She should want to leave a good legacy after her and not another GOP disaster like Bush II.

* She is not Trump. 

And that is the most crucial point. 

A trump presidency would be a disaster for the economy, outright dangerous to the rest of the world and he would instigate racial hatred from all corners. His policies would push back the US 30-40 years and as his history shows he doesn't employ the best people.

Russia might not intervene with any of LK's interviews or subject matters but they do own the network and pushes the network in a direction of their pleasing. 

Just the matter of fact that Trump praises Putin the way he does is concerning. Especially because Putin kills of journalists, newspapers, bloggers and any opposition heading his way. 

A third thing would be Trump being so damn clueless when he talks about foreign policy, intelligence, war and military that as soon as he opens his mouth he either insults a minority, people in general, military, a country or the sitting president.

&gt; “I confirm that,” the former mayor of New York City told Chris Matthews in a testy segment on MSNBC’s “Hardball” on Thursday. “And Donald Trump now confirms that.”
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has never confirmed that.
&gt; 
&gt; After several minutes of back-and-forth on the issue, Giuliani began laughing. 
&gt; 
&gt; “I don’t think this is funny,” Matthews scolded. “I think when you accuse the president of the United States of being someone who snuck in the country and assumed an identity, because that’s what Trump has been doing for years now.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Wait, a second. Wait, wait, wait,” Giuliani shot back, then proceeded to blame Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for the issue ― another conspiracy theory that has also been debunked. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Her campaign raised it originally,” Giuliani insisted. 
&gt; 
&gt; “No,” Matthews said. “You’re wrong.”

&gt; 
&gt; The new report draws on 55 million veteran records from across the U.S. over a nearly 40-year period ending in 2014. The previous suicide estimate was based on data from only 3 million records ending in 2010, an incomplete database which led people to question its accuracy.

3326,"[What it comes down to is culture and proper education/training](http://www.vocativ.com/usa/military/u-s-military-take-note-norways-unisex-army-dorm-rooms-working/) and possibly to force soldiers of both sexes to sleep in the same rooms to de-genderize each other.

&gt; Forcing female and male soldiers to sleep in the same room may sound like an odd way to improve the military’s notoriously poor gender relations, but the Norwegian Ministry of Defense has found success with a pilot program.
&gt; 
&gt; According to a new report, coed living arrangements actually facilitate “degenderization,” which helps to de-emphasize gender clichés and improve team morale. “There is no gender in the army. There is only green,” said one of the subjects in the study, “The Army: The Vanguard, Rear Guard and Battlefield of Equality.”
&gt; 
&gt; To obtain their findings, researchers Ulla-Britt Lilleaas and Dag Ellingsen looked at a base in northern Norway where unisex dorms were given a trial run—two women and four men to each room. According to Ellingsen, same-sex sleeping arrangements tend to pit one gender against the other. “We create stereotypes about each other,” he says. “But these mechanisms become less obvious with the unisex rooms.”
&gt; 
&gt; The report also claims that incidents of sexual harassment decreased as a result of the new policy—a finding the U.S. armed forces could take to heart. But are unisex dorm rooms really a viable solution for a country like the U.S., whose military experiences 19,000 sexual assaults per year?
&gt; 
&gt; Col. Ellen Haring, a 28-year veteran with the U.S. Army, believes such an easy fix sounds a bit too good to be true. “I suspect something else is going on culturally,” she says. “Like better training.”
&gt; 
&gt; In the U.S., nearly all barracks are coed, though individual bedrooms are still segregated. Once you are deployed, however, men and women often share the same quarters, especially if the base is in a remote location like Afghanistan. Recently, Haring’s own daughter slept in a room with her male colleagues when she was stationed abroad. “She had to change inside of her sleeping bag,” Haring says. Still, she didn’t seem to mind. As Haring explains, “It’s about being one of the team, rather than one of the boys.”
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, she claims that nearly every female soldier she has ever spoken to does not like to be separated from her fellow soldiers simply for the sake of privacy or safety. “It’s a degradation of team cohesion,” Haring says. “And when you’re staying with your whole team, what’s the likelihood of one man acting inappropriately?”

&gt; ""I can’t believe what our country is doing,"" Trump said, according to a BuzzFeed transcript. ""Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: It’s a carnage.""

We could do it surgically, stop him from doing it, and save these lives. This is absolutely nuts. We don’t want to get involved and you’re gonna end up with something like you’ve never seen before.""

3422,"Some big differences from the primaries though:
&gt; 
&gt; During the GOP primaries, Trump’s critics frequently pointed to what they said was his ceiling among Republican voters. But while there were times during the primaries when his support leveled out, Trump's path to the nomination consisted of a number of surges that ultimately ended with the real-estate magnate being the choice of a majority of GOP voters nationwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The general election, thus far, has been markedly different. Clinton has led Trump consistently, with just a few exceptions. And even though recent weeks show a slight uptick in Trump's numbers, there's no similar long-term trend that suggests he is poised to hit new highs in support among all general-election voters in the coming weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; With just two months left in the campaign, that leaves Trump with a tall task to break through his ceiling: He needs to convince more voters who don’t like him to vote for him.
&gt; 
&gt; Another reason Trump’s support is limited, compared to Clinton? In matchups with her — even without the third-party candidates — he is winning fewer Republicans than she is winning Democrats.
&gt; 
&gt; With nine weeks until Election Day, Trump will have opportunities to reset voters’ perceptions of him — especially with three nationally televised debates on the calendar. But with a ceiling currently between 40 and 44 percent, he’s at a distinct disadvantage against Clinton. And in order to claim a majority of the vote on Election Day, polls indicate he will have to win over voters who right now say they have decided they can’t ever vote for him.",2016-09-06 23:15:11+00:00,d7c4195,2.0,t1_d7c3x6g,172.0,politics

3424,"&gt; Kaine also recalled how Trump has regularly and falsely claimed that he was opposed to the decision to invade Iraq in 2003, even though he told radio host Howard Stern during a 2002 interview that he supported an invasion. Kaine also pointed to an interview Trump gave to the Fox Business Network in 2003 in which he said the invasion had been a “tremendous success.”
&gt; 
&gt; Trump had also attacked President Barack Obama for removing U.S. troops from Iraq, which Kaine pointed out was a process begun by President George W. Bush. But Kaine also quoted Trump in 2006 as saying the U.S. should “get out of Iraq as quickly as possible.”
&gt; 
&gt; “There’s no escaping the facts: Trump has misled the American people over and over about his position on Iraq,” the senator said. “He was for invading Iraq. And then he decided he wasn’t. He was for leaving Iraq. And then he decided he wasn’t. 
&gt; 
&gt; Kaine, at his rally, also said Trump lacked even the basic knowledge required to be commander-in-chief. He recalled an appearance on [Hugh Hewitt’s radio show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg3ZeFTpcM4) in which Trump mixed up the Kurds, an ethnic group in Iraq with which the U.S. military works, and the Quds force, part of the Iranian military.
&gt; 
&gt; “He talked about the Kurds because he had no idea what the Quds force is,” Kaine said. “In the same interview, Trump couldn’t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas either. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Trump doesn’t think our military has what it takes to stop ISIS. He literally said ‘we can’t beat’ them. He’s called our armed forces ‘[a disaster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syaB4FfWdtg)’ That they’re ‘in shambles.’ That they’re ‘going to hell,’” Kaine said. “I don’t know how anyone who’s met with our men and women in uniform could ever think that. As a military father, his disrespect for our armed forces infuriates me.”

It doesn't, my experience and views doesn't take away your experiences. You experiences matter also certainly. 

Of course I've witness racism a lot and bad behavior from a lot of different people and I too have prejudices and see stereotypes in people. But if I just take a minute to think I know that those are just that, stereotypes and not real and not based on facts.

I'm sorry you had bad experiences with multiculturalism, but from what you wrote you seem at least to be aware of that one can have a positive experience with multiculturalism as you can understand my experiences with it. 

So maybe I at least can try to convince you that not all experiences with multiculturalism is bad? and if you know that maybe you too can think a bit longer about the issue when you feel that you're experiencing a bad situation and racists thoughts, that those people doesn't represent every person of that skin color/background/etc. ",2016-09-06 21:39:27+00:00,d7c069i,8.0,t1_d7b2tla,65722.0,politics

I would argue that Trump is the insidious dictator of the two. His ""I ALONE WILL FIX IT!"" says a lot about him and also how sensitive he is when someone criticizes him. Like Clinton said: he can be baited by a tweet. 

After saying that he will fix everything he still haven't shown any real plans for how to fix anything while Clinton got tons of them out there. 

I'm also curious if you are supporting everything that would come with a Trump presidency. Increased racism and bigotry, more misogyny and bullying etc. He has shown repeatedly where he stands on these subjects and has done nothing to decrease it, even though most of it is coming from his base voters. The fact still stands though: he is encouraging it in the way he speaks.

3442,"&gt; That same day, Trump’s campaign, now set to receive tens of millions of dollars of other people’s money, finally sent five- and six-figure checks to Trump’s properties for events that had happened months earlier. Meaning that the GOP establishment had not only been defeated, it was now actually paying for that March 15 victory party attended primarily by members of Trump’s Palm Beach country club.
&gt; 
&gt; The preference for spending big at his own properties has continued since the RNC fundraising deal was signed. On July 29, for example, Trump’s campaign paid $48,240 to his golf club in Briarcliff Manor, New York, for “facility rental and catering.” The only campaign event there had been Trump’s June 7 party celebrating his wins in California and New Jersey that formally gave him enough delegates for the nomination.
&gt; 
&gt; And Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, received $21,330 on June 30. The only campaign-related events that appear to have taken place there in that time period are meetings between Trump and would-be vice presidential candidates.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump’s preference for expensive venues that he happens to own has also extended to his campaign airplane: his 25-year-old 757 jetliner that, thanks to its older, less efficient engines, burns some $10,000 in fuel every hour. That helped Trump rack up among the highest travel costs of all the presidential candidates, despite having kept one of the lightest campaign schedules.
&gt; 
&gt; If Trump had used his smaller Cessna business jet (he does, on occasion, when his destination does not have a runway long enough to accommodate the 757), he could have cut his $5.6 million in private air travel costs thus far in half.
&gt; 
&gt; While general election candidates typically do switch to using chartered airliners, they have defrayed the costs by letting their traveling press corps fly with them and then billing them for their share of the expense. Trump, instead, has flown only with a few staff members, with the media flying in a separate chartered jet.

&gt;Trump could have used space on the 15th or 17th floors that the building had actually had on the market during that period, but chose not to ― that is, until the RNC deal was signed. At that point, the campaign moved into larger quarters, including the 15th floor, and ramped up its rent payments from $35,500 a month to $170,000 a month.

Obama called it ""*a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the country itself*"".

&gt; 
&gt; “There's a long tradition in the United States of inclusion, immigration, diversity. But also people, once they're included in what they consider to be the real America, worried about outsiders, contaminating, polluting, messing up a good thing,” Obama said in an interview taped last week for CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” He cited examples from America's past, such as discrimination against Irish or Chinese immigrants.
&gt; 
&gt; “The long-term trend is people get absorbed, people get assimilated and we benefit from this incredible country in which the measure of your patriotism and how American you are is not the color of your skin, your last name, your faith, but rather your adherence to a creed, your belief in certain principles and values.”

No her whole point was that cyber-threats should be looked at seriously and be given the proper response and budget needed. That's it.

That still doesn't mean WWIII or dropping bombs. It can be infiltration, working with other countries to capture targets behind the attack, surveillance etc. Worst case scenario would probably be if they would **need** to drop bombs in retaliation.

&gt; 
&gt; While discussing the GOP nominee’s recent remarks about Putin on CNN Sunday, campaign surrogate Boris Epshteyn said, “First of all, Russia did not seize Crimea.”
&gt; 
&gt; An unauthorized referendum after the Ukrainian revolution led Russia to formally annex Crimea in 2014. Putin has repeatedly insisted that Russia has no military operations in the region.

&gt; **Boris Epshteyn, a Trump campaign adviser and surrogate, and Sergey Chemerin, a Moscow city official, at a panel promoting investment in Moscow in October 2013.
&gt; While business transactions may seem innocuous in and of themselves, getting the full picture of Trump confidantes’ investments in Russia could provide essential information about his potential political conflicts of interest**.
&gt; 
&gt; “In Russia, where business and the state are so closely linked, business dealings automatically imply ties to people high up in government as well,” said Kathryn Stoner, an expert in U.S.-Russia relations at Stanford University.
&gt; 
&gt; **In keeping with that pattern, Epshteyn has adopted some of the Russian government’s narrative about its annexation of Crimea, Ukraine’s southern peninsula, in 2014. The international community does not recognize Crimea as part of Russia, given the illegal nature of its acquisition of the territory**. 
&gt; 
&gt; **“Again, Russia did not seize Crimea,”** Epshteyn said in an appearance on CNN on July 31. “We could talk about the conflict that happened between Ukraine and the Crimea, it’s an ongoing conflict, but there was no seizure by Russia.

He didn't ""get"" a meeting. He and Hillary got invited because one of them is going to be the next president, he just said yes and got there before Hillary. It's a weak argument none the less.

&gt; 
&gt; **JB**: Kanye, I can't stop saying it, he's just a creative genius. When he came in, he told us, “I like this particular move, but I want to take it to the next level. Show me what you can do on top of this move.” He has something specific on his mind, as a visionary. And we have to translate that onto Teyana's body. Teyana's a beast, so it really made our job easy as far as, “Hey Teyana, give him what he wants. Let's do it this way. Let's try it this way.” That's basically how the day went down.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pitchfork**: Can you remember any specific things Kanye was pushing for?
&gt; 
&gt; **JB**: There is this particular movement called “bruk back.” It's a Jamaican dancehall dance, created by the dancers Outshine Crew. It's basically very gritty, a very earthy movement where you pound your back. He gave us a vision on how to incorporate some other locking and popping movement into that particular dance move, and you see Teyana doing it there in the video.
&gt; 
&gt; **Pitchfork**: Can you give us any insight into that final shot in the video, where Teyana turns into a cat woman?
&gt; 
&gt; **JB**: I think the vision behind that was how amazing Teyana is, and how she's been on the rise, and how she's working, and you are now seeing her blossom into this fierce lioness, this fierce cat. She has worked her way into that, and she's in a great position right now in her life. She has her family. She's being held down by her amazing husband. She has a beautiful daughter. You know, the lioness always protects her baby. I think it really is about her coming into her fierceness. And that's where she is in her life right now.

To me, these battles are on-going on a daily basis. Not just by swinging dildos but on TV with sex vs violence where the latter seems pretty much okay but sex is something offensive and should be covered. Same with swearwords.

I think it just comes down to that conservatism have a long history of being so conservative towards sex but not guns which they are quick to raise issues about. The dildo-waving is just a substitute for all things sex-related, be it sex, nudity, porn, gender issues or lgbtq-rights. 

You are right that these issues are actually unrelated, but as they are big issues for each party they are on the front-line of the political debate landscape. 

But in the end it comes down to sex vs violence, both are natural but from a conservative viewpoint only one thing is taught and that is bothering people.

3819,"Here's one of the biggest problems right now:

&gt; **Drug pricing follows a predictable pattern in most developed countries. In places like Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, the government sits down with drugmakers and haggles over how much they will pay.** Each country uses a different process, but the goal is the same — to balance drug companies' pursuit of profit with the public's interest in making useful treatments widely available and affordable.
&gt; 
&gt; **The United Kingdom, for example, runs its bargaining through the National Institute for Clinical Evaluation (NICE). NICE exists solely to decide at what point a new treatment is cost-effective: when it will save the health care system money in the long run by preventing further disease**. NICE runs dozens of these analyses each year, on drugs and surgeries and scanning devices. And it uses its findings to tell medical manufacturers: This is the price our country will pay for your service.
&gt; 
&gt; **In the United States, there's no such negotiation process to speak of. Federal law bars Medicare, the country's largest insurance plan, from even trying to negotiate bulk discounts with drugmakers. Once a pharmaceutical company sets its price, the government-run plan that insures 49 million seniors is required to accept it**.

&gt; There are thousands of private insurers, though, and they often have little clout to demand lower prices. **Other countries are essentially buying in bulk, like shopping at Costco. The United States does the equivalent of going to the local grocery store — and paying more**.
&gt; 
&gt; **""We don't have a NICE in the United States,"" said Steven Pearson, founder and president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that evaluates evidence on medical tests. ""We have a system that says, ‘If it's better, we have to provide this pill, and you, the drugmaker, get to name the price**.' It's not a market. It's a drugmaker saying what they want.""

3853,"Holy shit! I wonder who exactly was behind the decision to use Manafort as a campaign chief?

&gt; Some of Manafort’s clients were worse than unsavory. He spent four years in the early 1990s lobbying on behalf of a Kashmiri advocacy group that FBI investigation determined was actually a front group for Pakistani intelligence, the notorious ISI. For helping Pakistan’s ISI, which is infamous for its support to jihadist terrorism, Manafort’s firm received $700,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Connections to the ISI should have been sufficient to raise uncomfortable questions about Manafort, but the cause of his downfall this week is his open ties to corrupt oligarchs and Kremlin fronts in Ukraine. 

&gt; The scandal had not yet died down – including awkward questions about where this vast sum of money really came from – when worse appeared. Now we have learned that, during his years in Kyiv, Manafort’s translator and sidekick was Konstantin Kilimnik, who had spent several years with Russian military intelligence or GRU. Although Kilimnik made no effort to hide his Kremlin affiliation, he and Manafort became fast friends.
&gt; 
&gt; To anybody familiar with Russian intelligence, Kilimnik was very likely Manafort’s spy-handler. At best, he was an access agent for GRU, assessing the American for possible espionage. “There are no former intelligence officers,” as Vladimir Putin has stated, and one can only imagine the glee in Moscow when Manafort was appointed Trump’s campaign manager.
&gt; 
&gt; That role has ended with Manafort’s resignation. A shake-up this week reduced the seasoned fixer’s role as Trump tried to re-brand his damaged campaign to take on Hillary Clinton in early November. The exposure of Manafort’s long relationship with GRU was the final straw. Even Trump, for all his overt “bromance” with Putin, could not be seen to have such an obvious Kremlin proxy heading his campaign for the White House.",2016-08-23 20:31:54+00:00,d6tqpo6,5.0,t1_d6tpzu1,889.0,politics

* Kaine practiced law in Richmond for 17 years, specializing in fair housing law and representing clients discriminated against on the basis of race or disability.

* During his tenure as mayor, Kaine drew criticism for spending $6,000 in public funds on buses to the Million Mom March, an anti-gun-violence rally in Washington, D.C.; after a backlash, Kaine raised the money privately and reimbursed the city.[31]

* Kaine acknowledges the scientific consensus on climate change, and in a 2014 Senate speech criticized climate change deniers, as well as those who ""may not deny the climate science, but ... deny that the U.S. can or should be a leader in taking any steps"" to address the issue.[146]

* Kaine, a Roman Catholic, is personally against abortion,[155][156] but is ""largely inclined to keep the law out of women's reproductive decisions.""[155] Kaine has said: ""I'm a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade and women being able to make these decisions. In government, we have enough things to worry about. 

* In 2007, as governor, Kaine cut off state funding for abstinence-only sex education programs, citing studies which showed that such programs were ineffective, while comprehensive sex education programs were more effective.[162] Kaine believes that both abstinence and contraceptives must be taught, and that education should be evidence-based.[162]

* In 2006, Kaine campaigned against an amendment to the Virginia State Constitution to bar same-sex marriage,[164] and in March 2013, Kaine announced his support of same-sex marriage.
In the Senate, Kaine co-sponsored the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would bar employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.[167]
In 2005, Kaine said: ""No couples in Virginia can adopt other than a married couple — that's the right policy.""[168] In 2011, however, Kaine shifted his position.[169] In 2012, he stated that ""there should be a license that would entitle a committed couple to the same rights as a married couple.""[170]

* Kaine is ""generally pro-union"" and has received a 96 percent lifetime Senate voting rating from the AFL-CIO,[131] which praised his selection as vice presidential nominee.[171] However, Kaine supports Virginia's longstanding ""right-to-work"" law, which ""frees union nonmembers from any legal obligation to pay fees to a union that bargains collectively on their behalf"".[131]
* Kaine supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which expands the cases in which worker can sue against gender pay discrimination.[172] Following his selection by Clinton as a running mate in 2016, Kaine was praised by the National Organization for Women.[171][173]
* Kaine favors an increase in the minimum wage.[131]

* Kaine personally opposes capital punishment, but presided over eleven executions while governor.[187] Kaine said: ""I really struggled with [capital punishment] as governor. I have a moral position against the death penalty. But I took an oath of office to uphold it. Kaine vetoed a number of bills to expand the death sentence to more crimes, saying: ""I do not believe that further expansion of the death penalty is necessary to protect human life or provide for public safety needs.""

* Kaine ""strongly disagrees"" with the ruling in Citizens United v. FEC (2010).[209] In 2015, Kaine joined a group of Senate Democrats in a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White that said the ruling ""reversed long-standing precedent and has moved our country in a different and disturbing direction when it comes to corporate influence in politics.""",2016-08-23 17:59:43+00:00,d6tjall,6.0,t1_d6ti5vc,1363.0,politics

&gt; Linsky then asked Chen who he thought ""was paying for that.""

&gt; ""I don't know,"" Chen replied. ""I feel like it's some kind of really opaque strategy of electing Donald Trump to undermine the US or something. Like false-flag kind of thing. You know, that's how I started thinking about all this stuff after being in Russia.""

&gt; In his research from St. Petersburg, Chen discovered that Russian internet trolls - paid by the Kremlin to spread false information on the internet - have been behind a number of ""highly coordinated campaigns"" to deceive the American public.
&gt; It's a brand of information warfare, known as ""dezinformatsiya,"" that has been used by the Russians since at least the Cold War. The disinformation campaigns are only one ""active measure"" tool used by Russian intelligence to ""sow discord among,"" and within, allies perceived hostile to Russia.

Sounds so similar to how /r/The_Donald operates. Make everybody distrust the government, push propaganda about the other candidate, enhance (lie) news about their own candidate to make him look good even though it's a lie,  simplify real issues into vague talking points, appeal to people who are uneducated to get people angry, reach young people with memes so they can push posts (disinformation) to the frontpage all day, repeat.

3897,"&gt; How is Portman resisting Trump’s downward pull? Here are three factors that may be helping him separate himself from the presidential nominee in the eyes of Ohio voters:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Portman is in many ways the opposite of Trump. He’s a quiet, Chamber of Commerce-type of Republican, whereas Trump is a bombastic populist. Moreover, Portman has been in Ohio politics for over 20 years — he has an established brand in the Buckeye State that is distinct from Trump’s.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Ohio’s Republican Party has distanced itself from Trump in a way that few other state parties have. That distancing has been led by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who refused to attend the Republican National Convention — despite its being in Cleveland — and still hasn’t endorsed Trump.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Perhaps most importantly, Portman started a $15 million advertising blitz in June that seems to parallel his rise in the polls. As of the end of June, Strickland hadn’t raised even half as much as Portman spent in that ad campaign. That makes mounting an effective counterattack difficult.
&gt; 
&gt;  Still, Portman’s ability to keep Trump at a distance should give Republicans some hope in their quest to hold the Senate majority. Although Democrats have leads in enough races to take control of the chamber, their leads are small enough in enough states that it’s far from a sure thing — if more GOP Senate candidates can copy Portman, it could help the party keep the Senate.

&gt; How does a nation navigate such conflicting currents? Ideally, its political leadership would explain to people why these rights are important and propose bathroom accommodations that would ensure privacy and security. They would, well, lead—patiently, calmly, and honestly.

&gt; North Carolina Republicans just passed a law that requires people to use bathrooms corresponding to the gender of their birth certificates. It also limits civil-rights protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, preventing local governments from extending rights beyond what the state offers.
&gt; 
&gt; So it wasn’t enough for Governor Pat McCrory and his fellow Republicans to legislate bathroom choices. No, seeking to galvanize their conservative base, the GOP leadership took a gratuitous swipe at broader civil rights.

&gt; As others have alluded to, Republicans are not good with money after all. Even taking ill-timed tax cuts aside, they actually spend more than Democrats do. 
&gt; 
&gt; I looked into the numbers, and was surprised at what I found. Spending has increased from $2.9 trillion in 2008 under Bush II to $3.45 trillion in 2013 under Obama. I am not his biggest fan, but that's a 19.0% increase under Obama. Sound bad?
&gt; 
&gt; **Well spending increased from $1.79 trillion in 2000 under Clinton to that $2.9 trillion under Bush II. A whopping 68.5% increase in spending under Bush II**.

&gt; But what about Clinton? He brought in more tax money than any President in his time, so how much did he spend with all those inflows and a booming economy? Not much, and he not only balanced the budget but ran a sizable surplus, something no Republican has ever done in history. **The budget went from $1.38 trillion in 1992 under Bush I to $1.79 trillion in 2000 under Clinton. Only a 29.4% increase under Clinton, our best fiscal President**.
&gt; 
&gt; **Bush I only served one term, and was known for being conservative with money. So he couldn't have spent much. Right? Guess again. The budget was $1.06 trillion in 1988 under Reagan, and $1.38 trillion in 1992 under Bush. That's a 30.1% increase in spending under Bush I, more than under Clinton, in only HALF of the time in office. Ouch**! That's no better than his son.

&gt; **But Ronald Reagan, he is a hero to Republicans everywhere. He cut taxes left and right, and seems to get credit for cutting spending too. But did he?  NO.  Not even close. The budget was $591 billion under Carter in 1980, and $1.06 trillion under Reagan in 1988.  Reagan increased spending by 79.4%, making Reagan the biggest spender in modern U.S. history**. Because he also dropped taxes during this time, the first ballooning deficits occurred under Reagan, and he is actually our worst fiscal President of the modern era.
&gt; 

&gt; **Ronald Reagan increased federal spending more than any President since FDR, showering it mostly on military contractors, and somehow gets credited as someone who held back spending. He didn't at all**. Both Reagan and Clinton served as President during booming economies, but Reagan let spending run wild while Clinton held it back beautifully.
&gt; 
&gt; Reagan had chutzpah, that's for sure, but what he did not have was any sense of fiscal restraint or limit. And that's been true of every Republican since 1980.

4054,"Trump is only King of Bankruptcy's and possibly NAMBLA. There's so many good points in his op-ed on why Trump is unfit for president.

&gt; Former General Motors chairman and chief executive Daniel Akerson has instilled in his Catholic beliefs in his children, as well as in ""God and country,"" and the Navy veteran has always voted for Republicans for president.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Not this year,"" Akerson wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Wednesday evening. ""The compelling rationale behind this decision: leadership. **A good leader must demonstrate such qualities as competence, integrity, empathy, character and temperament. Hillary Clinton has these essential qualities. Donald Trump does not**.""
&gt; 
&gt; **Trump does not have the ""competence"" to be commander in chief,** wrote Akerson, who led the auto company from 2010 to 2014 before serving as vice chairman and special adviser to the board of directors at the Carlyle Group from 2014 to 2016. Trump previously called out General Motors as a company moving its production to Mexico in June but later removed it from a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; **""His knowledge of economic policy and foreign affairs is rudimentary, at best; his views are misguided,"" Akerson said. ""His threat to impose prohibitive tariffs on trade would repeat mistakes that contributed to the Great Depression.** His words and actions have rattled our European and Asian allies at a time when Russia and China are resurgent. He has demonstrated neither the capacity nor the inclination to learn from experts in global economics.""


&gt; ""As individuals and as a nation, we must aspire to serve the greater good. We must exhibit the empathy that places the greater good of the nation and its people above individual self-interest,"" Akerson said. **""Unfortunately, Trump has appealed to the lowest common denominators in our society: prejudice, xenophobia and intolerance. He has mocked people with disabilities, tarred ethnic minorities, demeaned women and insulted religious leaders, including the pope.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Akerson also took issue with Trump's ""schoolyard name-calling"" and distortions of the truth.

&gt; **""I simply do not believe that Trump could stand tall like John F. Kennedy did during the Cuban Missile Crisis, demonstrate the strength of Ronald Reagan in bringing about the end of the Cold War or articulate the vision of George H.W. Bush to support a unified Germany when the wall came down,""** Akerson said, writing that on the other hand, ""Clinton has been tested. She has demonstrated balance, calm and an even temperament.""
&gt; 
&gt; Clinton, he said, ""has an unparalleled knowledge of foreign and economic policy; she has run complex organizations such as the State Department.""

The administration is seeking $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but Congress is deadlocked over the funding.

4242,"&gt; You see, for those of us men and women who have felt real pain and the ramifications of real hate — not the superficial nonsense Trump displays in all his blustering at perceived or real verbal insults — we didn’t “get” the Purple Heart. There is no “getting” that award just as there is no “wanting” it. None of us volunteer for combat with the hope that we will come home in pieces, and some among us don’t get to come home at all. It’s not supposed to be easy to receive those medals. The meaning is lost when we start giving them away to people who don’t understand that.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn’t want the award because I knew it meant at least a piece of me would be left behind. We didn’t get the award; we each traded something for it. We traded our brains, our limbs, and many times our lives for that piece of metal.
&gt; 
&gt; So Trump’s words were accurate. Yes, it is big stuff. That medal symbolizes my sacrifice and the sacrifices of all those for whom that citation was read before and after me. But he didn’t have to trade anything. Trump didn’t raise his right hand to take the oath to complete the required trade for the metal should it become necessary in a fight for his fellow military members’ lives. He saw no action, no merit, no wounds, no military service.
&gt; 
&gt; But Trump got it. Right there tucked in his coat pocket, he got a Purple Heart. It was not awarded, it was not earned, he didn’t even have to spend $40 shipping from Marlow White since someone gave it to him. But Trump did, in fact, “get” one. That’s the only word for it. And I even believe that, yes, he wanted to get one. He certainly didn’t want to give something up for it; not his life or limbs or eyesight or the internal infrastructure that powers the mind.

&gt;Trump got what he wanted. I hope it does more than sit in his coat pocket and make him feel proud of how easy it was. I hope it makes him reconsider some of his definitions of sacrifice and honor.

&gt;But while I wait for that day, as I simultaneously wait for hell to freeze over, I’ll just sit here and reflect on how proud I am that he’ll never get mine.

4247,"&gt; Win or lose this November, Donald Trump is headed for the record books regardless, presidential historians say, albeit with an admittedly dubious achievement: the most falsehood-prone candidate in the two centuries of the republic.

4272,"Yep, it's called [The Republican Deficit Hypocrisy](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/opinion/campaign-stops/the-republican-deficit-hypocrisy.html). This journalist wrote about Trumps deficit back in January, estimated it would be 12 trillion. 

&gt; As a recovering Republican who retired in 2011 after serving on the House and Senate Budget Committees, I have concluded that this ritual denunciation of deficits and out-of-control spending is a fraud. Not only does the party not care about the deficit, but its practice since 1981 has been to worsen it.

&gt; We should pay particularly close attention to the Republican budget proposals from the presidential candidates in 2016. If a Republican is elected president, the party will almost surely have maintained control of Congress and, therefore, control the federal budget.
&gt; 
&gt; Since Mr. Rubio offers a detailed plan on taxes and spending — and since he is widely considered an “establishment” candidate — voters might carefully consider what his budget blueprint offers. Here’s the short version: It draws on fantasy math that would wreck America’s fiscal house.
&gt; 
&gt; On the tax side, Mr. Rubio slashes rates on personal and corporate income, and gives bigger breaks to wealthier Americans.
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn’t end there. Other candidates would reduce rates on capital gains and dividends, but Mr. Rubio would eliminate those taxes. He almost went out of his way to concoct a policy that would benefit the richest Americans: 79 percent of current revenue from these two taxes comes from the top 1 percent of earners, and less than 10 percent from the bottom 95 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; He would also end the estate tax. Republicans invariably call this the “death tax,” insinuating that it hits everyone unfortunate enough to die. Not even close: Only about 5,400 estates in America owe federal estate tax for 2015. But getting rid of it would add about $300 billion to the deficit over 10 years.

&gt; Mr. Rubio’s current fiscal plan is only in the middle range among the 2016 Republican contenders’ budget-busting schemes: Jeb Bush’s would add about $3.7 trillion to the deficit; **Donald J. Trump’s, an eye-watering $12 trillion. Yet they all rail against what they call Mr. Obama’s fiscal irresponsibility**.

And this is just a part of the article, it's worth reading. ",2016-08-07 20:38:10+00:00,d686l8x,3.0,t1_d6862yn,762.0,politics

&gt; – Folk ställde sig framför för att skymma dem från paraden. Men de fick nog stå 5 till 10 minuter innan polisen kom och körde bort dem, säger Stefan Röing, ett vittne som DN:s utsända talat med.
&gt; 
&gt; Polisen vill inte bekräfta att angriparna tillhör Nordisk ungdom. Göteborgs-Posten citerar dock i sin rapportering en talesperson för organsiationen som säger att ”vi har varit där för att demonstrera mot Pride”.
&gt; 
&gt; Lars Byström uppger att ingen person ska ha kommit till fysisk skada. Tio demonstranter avlägsnades från platsen, vilket innebär att de med buss fördes långt bort innan de släpptes fria.
&gt; 
&gt; – I sådana här fall är det svårt att få tag på någon eller några som kan ställas till ansvar för att ha organiserat en olaglig demonstration. Om det som skedde hävdas ha varit spontant har inget brott begåtts. Brott blir det endast om demonstrationen varit anordnad, säger Byström.
&gt; 
&gt; När demonstranterna dök upp, i hörnet av Sturegatan och Östermalmsgatan, återstod endast ett par hundra meter för de tågande fram till målet vid Östermalms idrottsplats.

He has dealth with [Russian Oligarchs](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/27/12271042/donald-trump-russia-putin-hack-explained) and almost everyone on his foreign policy team has ties to Russian companies and RT.

&gt; Trump’s partners on a Panama project traveled to Moscow in 2006 to sell condos to Russian investors, according to litigation filed in Florida. Trump also sold a mansion in Palm Beach in 2008 for $95 million to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, according to property records. Trump had purchased the mansion at a bankruptcy auction less than four years earlier for $41.4 million, records show.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2013, Trump found a new Russian partner for a Moscow real estate project, Aras Agalarov, an Azeri-born real estate developer who is sometimes called the ""Trump of Russia"" for his tendency to emblazon his name on his development projects.
&gt; 
&gt; The Agalarovs are wealthy developers who have received several contracts for state-funded construction projects, a sign of their closeness to the Putin government. Shortly after the pageant, Putin awarded the elder Agalarov the ""Order of Honor of the Russian Federation,"" a prestigious designation.

4438,"Listen, I'm a huge Bernie supporter and I got my issues with Hillary as well. What you got to understand is that Trump is dangerous, not only to the US but to the rest of the world as well because of the influence he would be able to take as a president. He has already managed to do incredible harm by inciting violence, dividing people and inciting hatred across all different kinds of groups. He's also making tons of false promises to be able to ""fix"" everything, even things that don't need to be fixed. But he has never said HOW he will be able to fix anything. Aren't you worried about that? Weren't you worried about all the fear mongering he and every speaker shouted during the RNC? Is that a future you want, where everybody is afraid of everybody all the time?

 I'm afraid that he will just be selling out high positions in government for the highest bidder, even more so than Hillary has done in the past and probably with even more incompetent people. 

He will make poor people even more poor by destroying the ACA and this will cause people to die, can you stand behind that? He will further the distance between the rich and the poor by giving out tax breaks to rich people and lowering the minimum wage which the democrats strive to raise to 15$, is that also something you want to stand behind?

Like Michelle Obama said, a president like Trump, what kind of inspiration to kids would he be by being a bully towards pretty much everybody? His presidency will inspire generations of bullies and hate, racial crimes and economic disaster. Do you have kids or do you know someone who has kids, if so would you for real say that Trump is an inspiration to them? When he mocks people with disabilities and people of less fortune than him. 

Overseas his policy's on NATO will cause turmoil in Europe because he's unsure if he would defend countries attacked by Russia. Judging from the RNC speakers his staff will probably consist of war hawks not being good at diplomacy but only war, and how will he be able to make other ME nations attack ISIS? He will force them he's said. Oh okay. Just like the wall the Mexicans are supposed to build. It truly doesn't work like that. But this is also coming from a man who adores dictators like Putin, Saddam and King Jong Un. Is that the guy you want to lead the free country of the United States?

The most important thing if you would be a Bernie or bust fan (I suspect you are a Trump fan but maybe someone else is reading this), why not vote for the most progressive democratic platform ever made (with the help of Bernie and his campaign staff)? This is bigger than Hillary at this moment, you don't have to agree with Hillary, but it's a fact that their platform is going to change things for the better if the democratic party as a whole wins this election in November. And as Bernie said, the political revolutions isn't dead it has just begun and people are more aware of his policy's than ever before.

4558,"Not sure why so many Trump-voters believe this. This round he will actually have to talk about his policies and not just blurt out random populist propaganda which people will eat up just because it's different from the establishment. 

When people will notice that the things he'll be saying doesn't hold up in reality people will see through him. 

Clinton will then shout a somewhat reasonable reply and people will take her side and cheer and applaud.  

It'll go something like this:

**D**: We will build a wall and the Mexicans will pay for it!

**H**: How will you build that wall? What are the logistics of building a wall that long, it's not possible and as someone with a lot of foreign politics experience it's definitely not possible to get the Mexicans to pay for it. Yes we have to solve this issue of immigration absolutely but we will have to take a realistic look at how things are in this country and not blame others!

Sign will say: *Please clap*

Audience will cheer and applaud. 

I dislike Hillary as much as anyone else but I don't think Trump have any chance of beating her in a debate when talking real policies. Just look at his speeches, they are not well spoken sentences of realistic ideas for change and hope they are just ten word sentences of inciting propaganda without any real substance. 

His only real chance in a debate is if he can attack her on her own faults and scandals, which is what I think he will do. I don't think he will be having a ""real"" debate, it'll be very superficial when he is talking about his policies, just like his speeches, dumbed-down to talking points starting with ""[we're going to make America great again](http://i.giphy.com/l2JJzZfUZAHugzB6g.gif)"".

4565,"&gt; Här slår ordningsvakten ner François, 25, utanför en söderkrog – och lämnar honom medvetslös på gatan. Tack vare polisens övervakningsfilm fälldes vakten trots att hans kollegor enligt polisen ljög för hans skull.
&gt; 
&gt; – Utan filmen hade väl ingen trott på mig, säger François.
&gt;  
&gt; Det är lördagsnatt den 6 september 2015. François, 25, från Versailles i Frankrike kommer till Bar 54 på Medborgarplatsen tillsammans med sina ingenjörskollegor. Han har nyligen tagit en masterexamen i energiteknik och är på tillfälligt besök i Sverige för att göra sitt examensarbete på ett svenskt företag.
&gt; 
&gt; I kväll ska han fira med kollegorna och sin svenska flickvän Madeleine, som väntar i baren.
&gt; 
&gt; – Jag hade druckit två tre öl, inte mer. Vi hade haft en trevlig kväll som vi tänkte avsluta på den här baren, säger François.
&gt; 
&gt; Men kvällen slutar snabbare än François trott. Plötsligt tar en vakt med hans flickvän ut från baren och François följer efter för att ta reda på vad som hänt. Där får han veta att flickvännen bedömts för onykter för att vistas i lokalen.
&gt; 
&gt; – Jag blev jätteförvånad eftersom jag inte alls uppfattat henne som särskilt berusad, säger han.
&gt; 
&gt; Här begår François ett misstag. Han tar ett kliv ut ur baren men har fortfarande ölflaskan i handen. En diskussion uppstår. Han pratar franska och engelska, men inte svenska. Det sista han minns är att någon plötsligt tar ett grepp om hans hals bakifrån så att han inte kan andas. Därefter är det svart.
&gt; 
&gt; Men händelseförloppet fångades av flera övervakningskameror. François står på uteserveringen och diskuterar med vaktchefen på Bar 54 när en av hans kollegor plötsligt tar strypgrepp på honom. Samtidigt vrider en tredje vakt flaskan ur François hand och tömmer innehållet över hans huvud. I klungan som omringat fransmannen står också en 40-årig ordningsvakt som precis avslutat sitt pass på ett hotell i närheten och är vän till vakterna på Bar 54.
&gt; 
&gt; När flickvännen Madeleine ser hur François blir behandlad försöker hon dra bort vakterna. Det besvaras med hårdare tag och François blir utdragen på gatan.
&gt; 
&gt; Plötsligt slår 40-åringen François i huvudet med full kraft – mitt framför ögonen på de andra vakterna. Han faller baklänges ned i asfalten och vakterna går därifrån och lämnar honom medvetslös på gatan.
&gt; 
&gt; Först när andra krogbesökare stoppar en förbipasserande polisbil kommer 54:as vakter tillbaka, men 40-åringen har då redan flytt in till baren – och ut genom en bakdörr.
&gt; 
&gt; Flickvännen Madeleine, har panik. Hon har precis sett sin pojkvän falla ner medvetslös på gatan och försöker ta sig fram till honom. Hon lyfts bort av vakter och polis, och är enligt polisen så uppriven att hon måste beläggas med handfängsel för att de ska kunna göra sitt jobb.
&gt; 
&gt; För poliserna på plats står det redan klart att misshandeln utförts av en vakt. Det har de fått höra både av vittnen och kollegor på ”desken”, där polisen bedriver minutstyrd övervakning via kameror uppsatta på särskilt utsatta platser i Krogstockholm.
&gt; 
&gt; Det finns en kåranda hos ordningsvakter, precis som inom andra grupper, och den har tyvärr inte varit sund i det här fallet.
&gt; – Det är uppenbart att han (ordningsvakten, reds anmärkning) sett slaget och det är även uppenbart att han ljög för mig om vad han sett. Jag anser att detta är mycket graverade för en ordningsvakt att dels inte ingripa när brott begås och dels ljuga för polisen, berättade en av poliserna i ett senare förhör.
&gt; 
&gt; Johan Säfström, yttre befäl på Södermalmspolisen, var också på platsen den aktuella natten.
&gt; 
&gt; – Vi fick samma intryck allihop, att vakterna som jobbade där skyddade sin kollega. Det stöds också av övervakningsfilmen och vittnesuppgifter, säger han i dag till DN.
&gt; 
&gt; – Det finns en kåranda hos ordningsvakter, precis som inom andra grupper, och den har tyvärr inte varit sund i det här fallet. Om de ljuger för oss är det naturligtvis inte bra, vi är deras förmän och ska kontrollera att de gör sitt jobb. Ordningsvakter är på sätt och vis polisens förlängda arm och deras lojalitet ska vara gentemot samhället och uppdraget, inte arbetsgivaren eller varandra, säger Johan Säfström.
&gt; 
&gt; I januari i år åtalades den 40-årige vakten för misshandel. Två andra vakter – som initialt misstänktes även för skyddande av brottsling – åtalades för tjänstefel. Under rättegången åberopade 40-åringen nödvärn. Han hävdade att François hotat honom flera gånger, redan inne i baren. Eftersom han fruktade för sin säkerhet gick han ut för att dricka läsk på uteserveringen, har 40-åringen berättat i förhör. Men där ska fransmannen återigen ha ”riktat sin ilska” mot honom, varpå han reflexmässigt svarat med ett slag.
&gt; 
&gt; Tingsrätten avfärdade nödvärn. I domen konstateras att slaget utdelades så snabbt att ”det inte fanns utrymme för XX (vakten) att känna sig hotad”.
&gt; 
&gt; – Under rättegången sa vakterna att jag hade gjort våldsamt motstånd, att de fruktat för sina liv. Det var som en mardröm, jag har aldrig ens hamnat i bråk förr, säger François.
&gt; 
&gt; 40-åringen dömdes för misshandel med påföljden 50 timmars samhällstjänst, samt 10 000 kronor i skadestånd. Han är avstängd som ordningsvakt i väntan på laga kraft vunnen dom, därefter ska polisen ta ställning till huruvida han får behålla sitt förordnande. De andra männen frikändes helt.
&gt; 
&gt; DN har varit i kontakt med ordningsvakten, som inte vill kommentera händelsen utan hänvisar till sitt förhör.
&gt; 
&gt; François är fortfarande chockad över det som hände.
&gt; 
&gt; – I flera veckor efteråt hade jag fruktansvärt ont i halsen och huvudet. Tankarna snurrade, det kändes som en mardröm. Jag kunde liksom inte fatta att det hade hänt eller varför.
&gt; 
&gt; Han säger att det tog tid innan han hade lust att gå ut igen och han känner fortfarande ett obehag när han är på krogen.
&gt; 
&gt; Polisen skriver att du var så berusad att de inte kunde förhöra dig efteråt.
&gt; 
&gt; – Jag var inte särskilt berusad. De försökte prata med mig efter att jag precis vaknat upp ur en medvetslöshet. Jag var helt tom, visste inte ens vad jag hette.
&gt; 
&gt; Du fick hjälp av ambulanspersonal på plats, men ville inte följa med till sjukhus. Varför?
&gt; 
&gt; – Jag var i chock och väldigt rädd, förstod ingenting. Jag ville bara försöka ta mig hem, de insisterade inte.
&gt; 
&gt; Har du någon idé om varför vakterna agerade som de gjorde?
&gt; 
&gt; – De kanske blev provocerade av att jag inte kunde göra mig förstådd på svenska, jag vet inte. Det var det mest otäcka jag varit med om.
&gt; 
&gt; Fotnot: DN har valt att inte ha med François efternamn i artikeln och att inte visa ansiktena på hans flickvän eller de berörda vakterna.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fakta. Tingsrättens dom**

&gt; • En 40-årig vakt, som nyss avslutat sitt arbetspass på ett hotell i närheten, åtalades och dömdes för misshandel. Påföljden blev villkorlig dom och 50 timmar samhällstjänst.

&gt; • Vaktchefen på Bar 54 åtalades för tjänstefel, men frikändes. Rätten ansåg det inte fastlagt att han bevittnat händelsen. Man bedömde att han fullgjort sin rapporteringsplikt när han skickat sms till polis med orden ”Vi behöver polis akut bar 54”

&gt; • En annan ordningsvakt (som tjänstgjorde på en intilliggande bar, men befann sig vid Bar 54), åtalades också för tjänstefel, men frikändes. Inte heller han hade med säkerhet sett händelsen, konstaterade rätten. Man accepterade också hans förklaring till varför han inte rapporterat händelsen till polis, nämligen att han utgick från att ordningsvakterna på Bar 54 skulle göra det.",2016-07-10 15:40:49+00:00,d56q8la,1.0,t3_4s5xsy,90.0,sweden

4577,"To me it felt almost like she was blaming everyone else involved, often saying that 300 other people were involved in the email chains with her and that they should've known how to handle classified material. I don't have a link to the clip though as I couldn't find it.

Would also like to see a transcript of it because I remember all her replies being very dodgy.  

EDIT: [Here's another clip from today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC2czvm7NfY) with another reporter that I saw interview her. 

EDIT 2:

Notes ~~lies?~~: 

* She says she used a single device.

* She says no emails were marked classified.

* She says she regret using a *personal email* (What about a full-blown homebrew server?)

* She says she turned over every document in her possession. 

EDIT 3:

[Here is the first interview with Wolf Blitzer.](https://youtu.be/ZkE-w7YcooQ?t=447) At 7:29 they start talking about the emails. 

quick notes:


* She says it was out of convenience she had a personal email.

* She will certainly not do it again, ""it was the wrong choice""

* There were about 300 involved in high positions which she emails and they were not sending any classified material, they were pursuing their responsibilities and they were not careless, she didn't believe she sent any classified material.

* Should she have known better:
""I just believe that the material being communicated by professionals many with years of handling sensitive classified material they did not believe that it was, I did not have a basis of second guessing **their** conclusion and these were not marked...""

* she repeats: over 300 people were involved... blablabla... and whatever **they** sent me they did not believe and had no reason to believe that it was classified. 

* Will she co-operate in the **new** DOS investigation: She dodges the question and says she co-operated in a previous investigation.

4606,"&gt;  Why is he so passionate about it?

I think what it comes down to is that he doesn't want to be put in just one category of artistry, or having to be in someone else's control e.g. a record label making his image for him and making him into what they perceive a ""rapper"" should be (or what society perceives a rapper should be).

He wants to be able to explore a variety of fields without it being any more weird than any other artist out there who's not a rapper exploring different mediums . 

I think it all comes down to these two points (creativity and control) because especially in hip hop there has almost always been certain rules that rappers had to follow by strict record labels if they wanted to be successful.

For example before Kanye there's weren't many rappers who took stances on things outside the hiphop community like Kanye's done (Bush comment, Taylor Swift vs Beyonce etc). 

Before Kanye, if someone outside fashion industry wanted to make something else most of the time they made a pair of shoes, or some t-shirts or collaborated with a famous fashion house who did most of the work and just put the name on it. 

The idea that an artist wanted to make a career outside his current career which got him famous weren't even on the scope for the record labels because that first career is what brought in the money for them. 

But Kanye took that to a completely different level, actually studying and learning the craft, talking with people in the fashion industry and as always, only working with the very best who appreciated his ideas and where he came from. 


I also think that the reason that Kanye is making headlines all the time and is able to do so many things is that he has truly let go of society's perception of what is okay or not okay to do in public. His ""rants"" or the way he's outspoken has truly worked for the best.

Imagine how freeing that must feel like if you are a celebrity who's surrounded by paparazzi 24/7. You can say anything you want now and people will either listen or just think you're crazy, either way you can say and do anything you want and that's an amazing thing. 

He has risen above everyone else and is able to explore his creativity and his public image in any way possible.

That's exactly the point of that segment. It makes you uncomfortable because of your own inhibitions and cultural background/thinking, it challenges those thoughts by showing these naked famous people, while someone, the camera (viewer) is breathing heavily like a perv watching them lying in bed naked, it's not rather sexy, it's just naked bodies some beautiful some not so beautiful, but they sleep just like the rest of us. 

It gives you a choice, should I continue to watch this? And you did, you are apart of the art piece now, lured in by the bizarre and unexpected, the fame and intimacy of famous people. 

It really doesn't matter who's real or who's wax. It's just a representation of these people anyway and not the point of the video.

4634,"That's not what I meant it to represent, just what might have  happened before everybody went to sleep in this ""art-universe"", if there was a narrative. 

I think it represents fame, voyeurism and intimacy. I wrote this in another thread regarding voyeurism: Especially when the camera stopped on different persons and the music was turned off and it was just breathing noises. That was to show us, the viewers, gazing and watching them at their most intimate moment. 

Also, just sleep itself. We are all just humans even though you're a president, a famous magazine editor, pop artists etc, sleep and sex isn't always sexy, it can be grotesque, dirty, beautiful and as varied as the human body itself is. 

And judging from many of the comments in the discord chat and here it was surprising how many were offended by the sight of naked bodies. People saying ""EW"", ""I didn't sign up for this shit!"", ""Fuck kanye for making me watch this!!"" and more. I think it says more about the people being offended by it than Kanye for making it because it's nudity=controversy. Kanye is aware of this of course and he loves to push boundaries. 

If he would've made something violent and bloody I bet people wouldn't be as offended by it as they were now. It's like the same issue in movies: Violence= okay, tits= NO WAY!

This is Kanye West we're speaking of. Not Black Eyed peas or anything like that. He's gonna challenge everyones perspective on music, visuals, fashion and whatever medium he decides to try out, like he's done since he started his career. 

If you want safe and unoriginal there's other artists you can try out but if you want something that that's gonna blow your mind, and give you an original experience worth remembering than Kanye is for you! ",2016-06-25 03:38:17+00:00,d4n5c53,1.0,t3_4pqp71,2126.0,Kanye

Men det kommer dröja flera år av ovisshet eftersom lagar måste ändras och nya avtal måste skrivas vilket kommer göra det mer komplicerat för folket. Pundet har redan blivit 10% svagare. 

Det kommer också bli dyrare för britter att resa utomlands och svårare för svenskar och andra européer att arbeta i UK. Många som arbetar där nu kanske måste sluta sina jobb och åka hem vilket inte bara innebär problem för företagen men givetvis för dom som jobbar där och deras kunder.

4725,"Haha okay maybe not that obscure but many artists I listen to doesn't exist on Spotify/Tidal. But I listen to many different genres and everything is not available in one place so to have different subscriptions to different streaminng sites would just be a hassle and too costly. So instead of having to go all ober the place (which I do in some cases anyway because I listen to a lot of music and try out a lot of new stuff) I have my own huge library.

A lot I listen to exists only on Bandcamp/Soundcloud and Bandcamp offers Flac which is great, Tidal's store offers Flac and when that format doesn't exists but I really want to pay the artists I use iTunes if the music is on there. 

I don't like streaming because the quality isn't good enough for me and I don't like to be ""served"" with what I listen to. I want to find it myself through music articles, tips from friends and people I know and of course Reddit. 

I also listen to a lot of movie soundtracks and most of the time they aren't either available. 

I mean streaming is great for people who likes to listen to music that way and it's great that so much music is available in a few clicks. I just don't listen to music that way. I've been ""collecting"" music since the 90s and have my own library which works great.

I like to have the files, especially in FLAC, and I like to have them in my own library and not be dependent on wither I'm online or not so I can do whatever the fuck I want with them. Tidal offers an offline mode within the app but that's not good enough for me. 

Apple Music would also be a big no no for me. I read that they even deleted music of someone's hdd because Apple had it in their library even though the person never got it from Apple in the first place. ",2016-06-15 21:25:03+00:00,d4aqy2l,5.0,t1_d4aqbbh,825.0,Kanye

4872,"Sorry but you're wrong. The reason the statistics seems higher in Sweden is because the [definition of rape is different here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden).

&gt; Historically, rape has been defined as forced sexual intercourse initiated against a woman by one or several men, without her consent.[2] In recent years, several revisions to the definition of rape have been made in Swedish law,[3] to now not only include intercourse, but comparable sexual acts initiated against someone passive—incapable of giving consent—because they are in a vulnerable situation, such as a state of fear or unconsciousness
&gt; 
&gt; Ever since the collation of crime statistics was initiated by the Council of Europe, Sweden has had the highest number of registered rape offences in Europe by a considerable extent. In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences registered in 35 European countries. However, this does not necessarily mean rape is three times as likely to occur as in the rest of Europe, since cross-national comparisons of crime levels based on official crime statistics are problematic, due to a number of factors described below.[11][28][29][30]
&gt;
 There are three types of factors that determine the outcome of crime statistics: statistical factors, legal factors, and substantive factors.[11][28][29] The combined effect of these ""make it safe to contend that the Swedish rape statistics constitute an 'over-reporting' relative to the European average"", according to a study by Hanns von Hofer, Professor of Criminology at Stockholm University, published by The European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research.[11]",2016-05-15 02:26:41+00:00,d35wgb2,4.0,t1_d35w2a2,771.0,funny
4873,"Louis Theroux is the tall guy with the glasses. He makes documentaries where he meets odd or extreme people of different kind. He's now making a documentary about Scientology and its members.

They are on a road close to a Scientology camp and the people he's talking to are Scientology members. They are known to be abuse everyone questioning their so called religion by filming them, stalking them, lying about them, ruining their lives in short. They are also known for abusing their own members in many different ways. 

Here they are claiming that Louis Theroux and crew are trespassing their private land when in fact they are on a public road. This short clip really summarizes the absurdities of Scientology's ways.

4903,"Nah don't worry about it! Actually that article in the link you posted had some interesting info about the making of the documentary:

&gt; “More than 10 years ago, I approached the church to see if they might let me in to make a documentary,” says Theroux in a statement. “I thought I might be able to bring a sense of nuance and perspective to people’s understanding of a faith that has been much ridiculed. Just as I have done with other non-mainstream stories, I hoped to see it from the inside and make a human connection with its clerics and congregants. But I was repeatedly turned down.”

&gt; Eventually, Theroux teamed with director John Dower and the pair set about detailing the story of the church using re-enactments of real events.
&gt; 
&gt; “In the course of making my film I came to believe I was being tailed by private investigators, someone in Clearwater, Florida (Scientology’s spiritual mecca) attempted to hack my emails, we were filmed covertly, I also had the police called on me more than once, not to mention a blizzard of legal letters from Scientology lawyers,” says Theroux. “And yet, at every step I remained open to Scientology’s good points and tried to see it for what it is: a system of belief that is not so different from other religions, capable of enlarging the soul as well as crushing the spirit.”   ",2016-05-14 00:37:23+00:00,d34qvh5,6.0,t1_d34qbgh,982.0,Documentaries

&gt;The possibility of a sequel to Independence Day had long been discussed,[9] and the film's producer and writer, Dean Devlin, once stated that the world's reaction to the September 11 attacks influenced him to strongly consider making a sequel to the film.[10][11] Devlin began writing an outline for a script with Emmerich,[12] but in May 2004, Emmerich said he and Devlin had attempted to ""figure out a way how to continue the story"", but that this ultimately did not work, and the pair abandoned the idea.[13] In October 2009, **Emmerich said he once again had plans for a sequel,[14] and has since considered the idea of making two sequels to form a trilogy.**[15] 

&gt;On June 24, 2011, Devlin confirmed that he and Emmerich had found an idea for the sequels and have written a treatment for it.[16] In October 2011, however, discussions for Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.[17] In July 2012, Devlin reiterated that the Independence Day sequel was still in development, and the script would take place in 2012, 16 years after the original film's events.[18]

&gt;In March 2013, Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be ID Forever Part I and ID Forever Part II.[19] The films will take place twenty years after the original, when reinforcements of the original alien race arrive at Earth after finally receiving a distress call. The new films will focus on the next generation of heroes, including the stepson of Smith's character in the original film. 

&gt;In May 2013, Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin mentioned that wormholes would be used as a plot device in ID Forever.[20] 

&gt;On May 29, 2014, it was announced that the script for the first sequel written by Emmerich and Devlin would be rewritten by Carter Blanchard.[21] 

&gt;On November 26, 2014, Deadline confirmed that Fox had greenlit the single film, and they were in talks with Emmerich to direct the film, while casting was reported to begin after Emmerich's confirmation.[22] The full title, Independence Day: Resurgence, was revealed on June 22, 2015.[23] Returns, Retaliation, Rises, and Requiem were all considered to along with the title before settling with Resurgence.[24]",2016-04-27 21:18:27+00:00,d2juva7,3.0,t1_d2juanv,778.0,movies

&gt;treason is out of the question. anything that may have happened in the case does not appear to match these special rules in the cause of touche in an statute for treatment -- for treason. impeachment is out because she is not in office. that is political and legal removal from office. but the issue of the foundation and its relationship to the server and any acts that may have been committed in exchange forin an statute for treatment -- for treason. impeachment is out because she is not in office. that is political and legal removal from office. but the issue of the foundation and its relationship to the server and any acts that may have been committed in exchange for moneys donated to the Clinton foundation is part of the investigation. we know from published reports that the FBI has a copy of this book, ""Clinton cash."" they have delved into it deeply. 

&gt;What has happened now is the Russian-Boeing deal, where Boeing went after mrs. Clinton to help them get a multi billion-dollar contract with the Russians for Boeing aircraft -- they were fighting with airbus. shortly after the Russians awarded a contract to Boeing, Boeing donated $900,000 to the Clinton foundation, and then another $2 million to the state department for a special program. We know agents are focusing on that and a number of other things involving Russia, including uranium deals. So while it is part of the server, because one of the things agents have done is they have gone the server, plus another server and four servers from the state department, they are trying to recover the 30 plus thousand -- 30,000 plus e-mails mrs. Clinton has said were personal and were deleted. they are operating under the theory that personal equals Clinton foundation. So therefore, things were deleted about the foundation, which has something to do with cash and official acts. that is underway. the lady is correct. 

The lady he's referring to is a caller who asked a question about the Clinton Foundation.

SD talar för sig själv vad dom står det krävs inget geni att ta reda på att dom inte har en hållbar politik utöver deras huvudpunkt som är att göra det svårt för alla invandrare och under deras styre hade fler högerextrema grupper uppstått och frodas i Sverige.

The lyrics if anyone is interested:



[Intro]

While you're fast asleep

[Verse 1]

Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

[Chorus]

I feel like this

I feel like this

I feel like that

I feel like this all the time

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that all the time


[Verse 2]

Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control? Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. Are your feelings easily hurt? Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

[Chorus]

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that all the time

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that all the time

[Verse 3]

Do you have trouble falling asleep? Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling across your body, trouble catchin' your breath?

[Chorus]

I feel like that

I feel like that

I feel like that all the time

I feel like that

I feel like that

5008,"Well no one can really know if he has been suffering from depression or not, but he hints at it on several songs in ways which people who has been suffering from it can relate to. E.g. he sings about Lexapro (an anti-depressant and for anxiety issues) in FML and U Mad, seeing a psychiatrist in NMPILA, in Clique he sings ""Went through deep depression when my momma passed, Suicide what kind of talk is that"" and he also brings up depression, severe heartbreak etc in 808s. 

The cool thing about Kanye is that he often really dumps out his emotions in his songs, that is what makes Kanye unique according to me. 

I think he has suffered from depression several times and has been on medication but it's nothing wrong with that. He talks about it when many others don't dare to talk about it, if he's on meds then good for him for trying to overcome his issues, if he's sees a psychiatrist then good it just means he's taking care of himself and his family.

Varje år får medlemmar psykiska och ekonomiska problem efter att dom blivit lurade att skänka bort allt dom äger.

[Här kan du läsa om Rolf och hur hans rehab med Narconon gick](http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/har-ar-hela-artikeln-som-fick-scientologerna-att-se-rott/):

&gt; 1991 anländer Rolf Nilsson till Narconon efter att ha gått på heroin i sex år. Socialförvaltningen rekommenderade då honom dit och efter ett introduktionsmöte var allt klart. Efter en vecka skulle han flytta in. Han hade då bestämt sig för att sluta med drogerna.
&gt; 
&gt; ""När jag väl kom dit var mottagandet ett helt annat. De hade ett helt annat förhållningssätt. De sa att jag inte fick prata eller ringa någon utanför. Inte ens till flickvän eller till familjen. De övervakade varenda steg, de skulle till med vara med om man skulle gå till kiosken så att man inte skulle kontakta någon"". 
&gt; Rolf Nilsson beskriver vistelsen som otäck. Överallt fanns scientologlitteratur och **han berättar att personalen försökte dyvla på honom dyra scientologikurser**. 
&gt; ""Det kändes som att de behandlade mig som en gammal disktrasa som man kan behandla hursomhelst"", säger han. 
&gt; Efter en månads avgiftning i bastuprogrammet lämnar Rolf Nilsson Narconon. Redan samma kväll tar han sig ett återfall.",2016-04-19 20:56:32+00:00,d29dxz7,8.0,t1_d29ajj4,4272.0,sweden
5020,"Du tror väl inte att det är någon större skillnad på Scientologerna i Sverige jämfört med andra länder? Det är samma metoder överallt även om ""kyrkan"" inte är lika skandalomsusad här som i USA t ex. Det handlar inte bara om vad den svenska scientologkyrkan har gjort mot deras medlemmar bakom låsta dörrar utan vad dom står för, hur dom lurar sina medlemmar på besparingar och beter sig allmänt mot folk som inte står bakom kyrkan, kanske främst mot ex-medlemmar som blir trakasserade osv. 

&gt; **Riksorganisationen för ett drogfritt Sverige** är enligt egen utsago en ""opolitisk och icke-religiös ideell förening som arbetar för att skapa ett drogfritt Sverige."". Föreningen bildades 1992 och arbetar över hela Sverige. **I SVT-programmet Uppdrag granskning har det däremot påvisats att organisationen har starka kopplingar till Scientologikyrkan, främst genom ett nära samarbete med Narconon, som är en av Scientologirörelsens frontorganisationer**.


&gt; **Kommittén för mänskliga rättigheter** (KMR, på engelska Citizens Commission on Human Rights International (CCHR)) **driver aktiva kampanjer emot psykiatrin**, däribland ett museum i Los Angeles samt gjort en film, Psykiatrin – Dödens Industri.[22] **Kommittén för Mänskliga Rättigheter i Sverige hamnade i blåsväder under slutet av september 2008 då det uppdagades av Uppdrag Granskning att de fått in stora inkomster från svenska kommuner som trott att de stött en organisation som arbetar för mänskliga rättigheter. Bland andra Tjörns kommun tog sedan i programmet avstånd från organisationen**.


&gt; **Narconon** är ett kritiserat rehabiliteringshem där patienterna behandlas med metoder där bl.a. överdosering av B-vitaminer och dagliga 5-6 timmars bastubad sker. **Metoder som också påstås kunna driva ur radioaktivitet ur kroppen**. I Sverige kom Narconon 1972 och har idag behandlingshem i Eslöv och viss verksamhet i Göteborg och Västerås. År 2008 stängdes behandlingshemmet i Huddinge. **I Sverige fick organisationen negativ uppmärksamhet efter en reklamfilm innehållande det svenska kungaparet utnyttjades utan dess tillåtelse [24] samt att filmen innehöll arrangerad och felaktig fakta**.


&gt; I Sverige har Scientologikyrkan varit inblandad i en kontrovers som började med att den svenske scientologikritikern Zenon Panoussis lämnade in en kopia av NOT-dokumenten (""New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans"") till Sveriges Riksdag. Dokumenten, som Scientologirörelsen hade upphovsrätten till, blev därigenom en offentlig handling. **Scientologikyrkan försökte hindra allmänheten att läsa dokumenten genom att ha medlemmar som satt och läste dem hela tiden under kontorets öppettider**.

Another important feature is that you can turn off a subreddit design style real easy if you think it's ugly or just confusing. Which I do on almost all subreddits because the plain design of RES is much quicker to read overall. 


RES also shows you which users you have upvoted/downvoted (and how much) which can be useful many times. You can also tag a user with a certain color and whatever you wanna write so you can see them easily. 

It comes with an account switcher as well, good if you are several people using the same computer or if you got throwaways. 

You can also filter out subreddits from /r/all really easy. If you see a sub you don't like you can just hover over the subname and press +Filter. 

There's many more features but those are the most important to me. 

EDIT: I don't think it works on mobile, maybe Android? But I use Alienblue for iPhone.

Remember that you can connect all settlements using Supply Lines so everything in your Workshop (all the Junk) gets into a network so you don't have to carry everything over to the next settlement you going to. So how it works is that once you have a settlement and settlers come in (after you've built the Broadcast beacon) you talk to them and press Q for Supply Lines and just choose another settlement for them to be sent to. They turn into a Provisioner and walks off to that other settlement with supplies and a brahmin. Go into your map and press C and you will see the Supply Line you have started between those two settlements. So everything in either of your workshop benches is now connected. 

Make sure there are beds, water, food and electricity for everyone and I usually start with a Bar, Clinic and General Trader for stores. 

If you run out of space so you can't build anything more (if the bar in the top right corner is full and yellow in Workshop Mode) you can Scrap apparel and weapons to get more building space. ",2016-03-20 20:37:56+00:00,d172jyt,2.0,t1_d16uyb9,12910.0,fo4

Kvinnorna vaktade inte badhuset utan lånade det bara för att ta bilder, enligt badmästaren**. 
&gt; 
&gt; Barometern talar givetvis även med chefen för Äventyrsbadet, Susanne Gryfelt. **Enligt henne finns det inget särskilt problem med tafsande i badhuset som dykt upp på senare tid – några enstaka incidenter men inget som avviker från det normala**.
&gt; 
&gt; – De här tafsvakterna har inte tillfört något, snarare tvärtom. Nyligen hade jag en kund som sa upp sitt årskort för att hen inte vill bli övervakad av några vakter, säger Gryfelt till Barometern.
&gt;

[Biography](http://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/demna-gvasalia):

&gt; Demna Gvasalia's status in the fashion industry was cemented when it was announced in October this year that he would be taking over fras artisitic director of Balenciaga. Francçois-Henri Pinault, president and chief executive of Kering - parent company to the iconic Parisian hous - praised the designer as ""a powerful emerging force in today's creative world."" Gvasalia's first collection for the brand is expected to debut at Paris Fashion Week in March 2016.
&gt; 
&gt; Alongside the position, Gvasalia will retain his role as head designer and spokesperson for Vetements, the buzzed-about collective of seven anonymous designers based in Paris where he made his name after rising through the ranks at Louis Vuitton and Maison Martin Margiela,Part of the city’s alternative fashion scene, Vetements has drawn the focus away from traditional houses with its simple, streamlined cuts and authentic, youthful energy. Only three seasons old, the brand has already been nominated for LVMH’s Young Fashion Designer Prize.
&gt; 
&gt; Gvasalia cites Vetements’ personal focus group – his friends – as its main source of inspiration. He has breathed fresh life into the Parisian fashion scene, moving away from the older, more conservative houses and breaking convention with events including hosting a show in a famous Parisian gay club, casting said friends as the models.
&gt; 
&gt; In an interview with The Business of Fashion , Gvasalia explained: “We all met and realised how frustrated we were. We started to lose a sense of fun in fashion. We feel it is inevitable and crucial to create contemporary clothing. We are having a dialogue with today.” The collections born out of their project are minimal without being flat, edgy without the gimmicks. “The most important ingredient for us is the reality, what our woman wears to feel good,” the collective told BoF.",2016-02-24 19:39:37+00:00,d0cb4yg,1.0,t3_47eeul,163.0,Kanye

&gt;[Ferdi](http://www.aluxurytravelblog.com/2014/06/18/5-of-the-best-paris-restaurants-and-eateries-for-lunch-or-dinner/):

&gt; Nestled between two boutiques in the 1st arrondissement, this pint-sized restaurant packs a ton of flavour. Monday through Sunday Ferdi has become a staple hotspot for the Paris scene whilst remaining a very casual affair. The menu (which is more book-like than menu) will take your senses south of the equator, on the same journey the owner took while travelling the world acquiring many of Ferdi’s recipes as well as the eclectic objects that decorate the restaurant. 
&gt; 
&gt; To define Ferdi by one type of cuisine would be limiting it, however there is a definite South American influence weaving through the menu. The crowd is just like the restaurant, eclectic – artists, socialites, celebrities and everyone in between. You are made to feel comfortable, well taken care of, and do not expect to leave hungry.
&gt; 
&gt; **Must taste**: The McFerdi burger, the meatballs, the corn on the cob, the ceviche, the walnut salad.
&gt; 
**Must drink**: Mango Margarita, Bloody Mary

&gt; **Address**: 32 Rue du Mont Thabor, 75001

&gt; **Hours**: Ferdi is open for dinner Monday through Sunday (you may want to reserve ahead), and lunch on Saturday (starts at 1:15pm) for which no reservations are taken, walk-ins only.",2016-02-18 19:55:36+00:00,d04wnpc,2.0,t1_d04wnat,14.0,Kanye

&gt; The plan will likely involve a brigade-size force — or between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers — and will also include placing stocks of well-maintained gear and ammunition in forward locations across NATO's eastern flank, defense officials said.
&gt; 
&gt; “We're going to have to help countries to harden themselves against Russian influence … and also mount — as we did in decades past — staunch defense of our NATO allies,” Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Tuesday in Washington.
&gt; 
&gt; “This is an unwelcome development in European history,"" Carter said.
&gt; 
&gt; Details of the new European deployments came as Carter spoke about the Pentagon’s budget request for fiscal 2017, which begins in October. That budget request will be officially released next Tuesday. .
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The new Pentagon budget aims to boost spending on operations in Eastern Europe, specifically known as the European Reassurance Initiative, or ERI, from about $800 million this year to $3.4 billion in 2017, Carter said.
&gt; 
&gt; “That will fund a lot of things: more rotational U.S. forces in Europe, more training and exercising with our allies, more pre-position and war-fighting gear and infrastructure improvements to support all this,” Carter said.
&gt; 
&gt; “All of this together by the end of 2017 will let us rapidly form a highly capable combined arms ground force that can respond across that theater, if necessary,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; A statement from the White House on Tuesday said expanded European operations will provide ""continuous U.S. armored brigade rotations"" and ""enable a quicker and more robust response in support of NATO’s common defense.”
&gt; 
&gt; The Pentagon has about 65,000 U.S. troops assigned to U.S. European Command, down from a peak of more than 200,000 in the 1980s. The rotational forces in Eastern Europe would amount to an increase in EUCOM force levels, the first in decades.
&gt; 
&gt; **The new troops would come in addition to the Army's current force in Europe, which includes two brigades of about 3,500 soldiers each.**",2016-02-03 21:37:22+00:00,czmrr5q,5.0,t1_czmrey6,444.0,sweden

The tension from the buildup before they strike and the real consequences of slinging a sharp blade towards eachother. There will be blood and wounds and hard strikes. This has nothing of that. There's not really a sense of power in these strikes they're doing or when defending themselves. 

But I mean Gareth Evans does great fight choreography otherwise and with a good choreographer who knows traditional Japanese sword fighting he could make a really good samurai movie.

Det är svårt att ha en rationell diskussion med dig när du drar slutsatser från ingenstans hela tiden. Ja jag är orolig att det skulle bidra till att skapa ett samhälle där vi har andrahandsmedborgare, om jag hade velat bo i Indien så hade jag flyttat dit. Sverige ska vara ett öppet demokratiskt samhälle, inget konservativt vakuum. Självklart vill jag att alla ska kunna känna sig säkra på ett badhus. 

&gt; Du förstår väl att det är en situation flyktingarna själva har skapat och förtjänar?

What? Är flyktingsituationen en situation som dom själva skapat och **förtjänar**? Det går verkligen inte att diskutera med dig när du har en sån förenklad världsbild om allt. IS och den massiva flyktingströmmen är en direkt konsekvens av Bushs Irak-krig (vilket ledde vidare till kriget i Syrien och IS) och klimatförändringen. Menar du på riktigt att ALLA flyktingar förtjänar att stå till svars för att några idioter inte kan bete sig? 

&gt;  Jag tycker de bör bli kollektivt ""orättvist"" behandlade tills de sköter sig och ofredanden upphör.

Om dom blir kollektivt ""orättvist"" behandlade kommer dom bara ogilla svenskar och det svenska samhället ännu mer, och inte bara dom som gjort en massa ofredanden utan alla. Som sagt väldigt kortsiktigt tänkt.

Jag såg länken och jag tycker det är ett väldigt drastiskt beslut som kan slå tillbaka i längden. Man gör samhället mer stängt vilket i slutändan är precis det som ISIS och Al Qaida vill. Dom vill skapa en barriär mellan västerlänningar och muslimer för att få fler muslimer att otrivas och flytta tillbaka till mellanöstern vilket dom skulle tjäna pengar på. 

Det är dessutom ett väldigt lokalt beslut där det är oklart hur dom ens ska genomföra dom nya regleringarna.

Självklart vill ingen att det här ska hända och åtgärder görs.

Behöver du seriöst fråga det? Självklart föredrar jag inte det. Men allt är inte så jävla svart och vitt helt enkelt. Med badhusen så kan man införa fler vakter, kameror och självklart inte låta dom som begått brott få gå dit igen. Det är ju skitsynd att det ens ska behövas vara så men som en temporär och snabb lösning på problemet. Man borde även sätta krav på flyktingboendena att utbilda deras inneboende om hur saker och ting fungerar i Sverige om inte det redan är något dom gör så klart, spec med badhusen.

Som jag sa tidigare så behövs det utbildning om hur annorlunda det är i Sverige jämfört med Afghanistan/Syrien etc så fort flyktingarna kommer hit. Tyvärr är det så illa skött redan från början.

5673,"&gt; When legendary Russian auteur Aleksei German died in 2013, he left behind this extraordinary final film, a phantasmagoric adaptation of the revered sci-fi novel by the Strugatsky brothers (authors of the source novel for Tarkovsky's STALKER). HARD TO BE A GOD began percolating in German's consciousness in the mid-1960s, and would actively consume him for the last 15 years of his life. Happily, he brought the film close enough to completion for his wife and son to apply the finishing touches immediately after his passing. 

&gt; Taking place on the planet Arkanar, which is in the midst of its own Middle Ages, the film focuses on Don Rumata, one of a group of earth scientists who have been sent to Arkanar with the proviso that they must not interfere in the planet's political or historical development. Treated by the planet's natives as a kind of divinity, Don Rumata is both godlike and impotent in the face of its chaos and brutality.

5679,"&gt; because they have made up their mind

But so have you? You're making up connections that aren't necessarily there. Just because those Scandinavian cities happen to lie close to each other you assume that those cities strive with interconnected businesses and activity. 

If we are going by tourism, [Stockholm was placed nr 13 on a top 15 list of most attractive destinations in 2013](http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/About%20Us/Publikationer/FactsAboutStockholm%C2%B4sTourismIndustry.pdf). 

&gt; With close to 11 million commercial overnight stays in
&gt; 2013 in the county, Stockholm ranks thirteen on the list
&gt; of most attractive destinations in Europe according to
&gt; the European Cities Marketing Benchmarking Report
&gt; 2013-2014. This is a drop compared to last years rank as the tenth
&gt; most attractive destination in Europe. 

Although Copenhagen got some more international bednights that year that could partly be explained by Denmark lying on the continent and get more international connecting flights.  

Talking about business, [Stockholm has one of Europe's highest GDP per capita and ranks number 7 on the top 20 list in 2013](http://www.stockholmbusinessregion.se/Global/About%20Us/Publikationer/Facts%20about%20Business%20in%20Stockholm%20-%20Statistics%20for%202014.pdf). Outranking Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen etc.

&gt; There is a lot of connection between Oslo and Copenhagen as well. That is my point: Norwegians have a lot to do with both Gothenburg and Copenhagen, but relatively little with Stockholm

Please give a source for this. It looks like you're just making this up because you met a Norwegian in Copenhagen. 

At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because Norway, Sweden and Denmark each share markets in each other's countries and there are high amounts of business travel between Stockholm and Oslo for example, so why you are claiming that statement (that Stockholm is isolated) is beyond me.

It takes 6h by car from Stockholm to Oslo. It takes the same amount of time from Oslo to Copenhagen. It takes 4h from Stockholm to Malmö with train or less than an hour with a plane. 

Stockholm is the Capital of Scandinavia simply because A; it's a marketing trick, because it's the biggest city in Scandinavia, it's the most populated city, and has a really big airport (Arlanda) which serves as a hub to the rest of the world. 

From my own experience of visiting Oslo, Copenhagen, Malmö, Göteborg and living in Stockholm, Stockholm is the only city which actually feels like a true metropolitan/cosmopolitan area in the same sense as for example New York, London and Berlin (but of course a little bit smaller in population) and therefore it has earned the title ""The Capital of Scandinavia"". 

If you visit any of those other cities you will notice how small they actually feel compared to Stockholm.

Their news are just regurgitated crap with no sense of journalism that fits their point of view. 

I've been following this since it broke out and this is regarding JAS Gripen fighters to be used for reconnaissance missions, not bombing missions. 

&gt; As the United States, Saudi Arabia, France, UK, Russia, Turkey (until recently), and others are all bombing Syrian targets, it is reasonably logical to assume additional aircraft would be tasked with the same missions. 
&gt; 

Well that's your first mistake, to just assume something instead of knowing the facts. 

EDIT: And Sweden do support France in many other ways as I wrote in a post above: 

France gave Sweden a whole list of things they needed and on that list were jets to be used for reconnaissance missions, not to bomb someone. Sweden decided to help in other areas of interest that were on that list, for example military transportation planes, officers to Mali and a big pile of money.

Other countries have provided the needed fighter jets and Sweden are open to sending them in the future as well. It's not like France are all grumpy over this decision, it's just blown out of proportion by the media and the right.

About the GIF your friend sent you, the lens flare is moving because your friend is moving the camera to the left as well. It syncs up, there's not UFO or orb thing, it's just an optical lens flare moving to the left with the camera.

5910,"I think that if some kind of disclosure would happen it would probably be a really soft one not related with much of the UFOs that would've come here. 

What I mean by a soft one I mean that first they would discover Earth like planets, microbacterias, maybe some simple life or even animals living in an ocean on one of the moons by Jupiter or Saturn for example. And then maybe some radio signals and/or mega structures. 

Why this slow way? Because ""they"" would never admit to having any prior knowledge of aliens that have landed or visited us because that would mean they have been lying to us for 60 years or more. It would be a clusterfuck of ""I told you so's"", lawsuits and maybe even riots and a whole new bunch of cults would pop up. 

With this slow soft approach most people would probably be bored of it, like the discovery of water on Mars and so on. ""Bacterias on a comet? Wow /s"", ""a fishthing on Europa?! Great!"" And so on.

Den hette iaf: [Min pappa skrev ett mystiskt brev](https://www.flashback.org/t571140).

EDIT: Fick det att fungera, bokmärket var en .info länk men provade att byta till .org och då gick det. Första inlägget:

&gt; För ca 1 år sedan dog min pappa. Han och jag hade ingen som helst kontakt, han skulle köpa cigaretter när jag var 1 år gammal och kom aldrig tillbaka. När han dog blev jag kontaktad och det visade sig att jag hade 2 halvsyskon till. Alla vi hade olika mammor. Ett av syskonen hade kontakt med pappa till vuxen ålder. Den andra hade samma erfarenhet som mig, dvs han stack tidigt. 
&gt; 
&gt; Nu skulle vi 3 gå igenom hans hus, han hade inga andra släktingar. Då hittar vi ett handskrivet brev långt in i en byrålåda, så här stod det ordagrant.
&gt; 
&gt; Med denna nyckel som passar i ett skrin som är nedgrävd inom staketet där det dinns till er tre barn en god sudd efter en god affär samt en vinst. När solen står 19:30 den 25:e juni där röken går ut i ""skuggan"" ligger skrinet? Spade står i bon, lycka till Pappa
&gt; 
&gt; Efter vi läst detta började vi direkt fundera på VAR finns skatten, vi grävde lite här och där på måfå utan att hitta något. 
&gt; Han dog urfattig, hade bara ""skit"" i huset utan värde. Nu kan jag inte riktigt släppa tanken, finns det en skatt nedgrävd eller gjorde han det här för att djävlas med oss. vad tror ni?",2015-10-18 22:08:31+00:00,cw4gimc,1.0,t3_3p9irr,7888.0,sweden

Jag har nu gjort en liten spelplan för att fixa yxorna, du får gärna rätta eller lägga till något steg om det saknas något.

1. Använd slipmaskin för att ta bort rosten på yxhuvudet, komplettera med borrmaskin med stålborstetillsats ifall det behövs. 

2. Använd WD40 eller 5-56 spray för att rosten inte ska komma tillbaka. (Alternativt: använd värmepistolen för att värma yxan och pensla på linolja för att undvika att rosten kommer tillbaka).

3. Använd skärpfil för att få en bra egg och gå sedan till sandpapper (fäst på en trädbit) 400-600-800-1200, strigla sedan med läder och använd autosol för att polera ytan (?). 

4. Slipa skaften och ~~pensla~~ använd en trasa ~~in dom~~ med linolja, torka sedan av överflödet. 

5. Måla skaften. 

6. Succé!

Jag hade gärna sett att ytan blev som den var när den var smidd, så det lutar åt linolja för rostskydd. Menar du att ytan då kommer bli mörk som på t ex den [här yxan](http://www.route62.se/bilder/artiklar/zoom/13582_1.jpg)? 

Räcker det om jag använder en värmepistol för att värma yxan?
Ska man pensla exakt hela huvudet eller ska man undvika att pensla eggen?

On the other hand, something can be feminist but not egalitarian because you can believe in gender equality but not racial equality for example.

But if you just mean that ""hey, in Mad Max, characters of men and women have been treated equally in their portraying"", well that IS feminism to the core. Feminism haven't changed its meaning over the years, it's about gender equality but sometimes individuals use their own agenda to push something which is not truly feminism. 

I think Miller really tried to focus on this (gender equality) in Fury Road and that is why he brought in [Eve Ensler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Ensler) to consult on these issues on how women are portrayed in most (action?) movies made today.

This is her total revenge against Immortan Joe and all he has done to her over the years and to what he has forced her to do (probably a lot of bad stuff to get her in the Imperator position), she has worked for him even though he kidnapped her and her mother.

&gt; Gravplatsen, som är en så kallad stenkammargrav, har stått på Österlen i drygt 5.000 år. Frågan är hur länge den står kvar i nuvarande form. Enligt en av länsstyrelsen anlitad expert kan till exempel åska eller frost bidra till att stenen framöver spricker ännu mer. Stenar har stuckits in som kilar för att försöka förhindra ras.

If it would ""come out"" that they are airing something that is identical to an awful incident as this one it would become news itself and USA would get bad PR for airing something so similar so close to the incident itself. Similar to shows and movies which had an similar plot as 9/11. It would be considered insensitive by many news outlets and some audience and would have maybe given USA a loss in ratings all over the board because of the bad press. 

People might've even written petitions or it could've become a twitter tag sending all tons of shit to USA.

6422,"First I thought that this could actually be something. Maybe something similar to the Hessdalen lights in Norway. 

But at 7.50 in the video it's pretty obvious what it is. It's just airplanes coming in for landing or taking off much further away than where they  think the lights are located. 

The lights at 7.50 are going to the left and then turning [towards the camera](http://i.imgur.com/oDBChV8.png) (8.17) and this is where it's the most obvious, the light pattern is green on the airplane's right wing, the white light in the middle is the head light and then we have red on its left wing. [Pics here](http://imgur.com/a/F0WYJ).,

It then banks left again only to be [seen from the side](http://i.imgur.com/ZZPn9R5.jpg) (around 8.50). 

A bit later (9.37) the airplane turns a bit more to its left and is moving away from the camera so we see the back of the airplane, notice that the green light can be [seen on the right side now](http://i.imgur.com/28Fi68w.jpg).

The green and red on the airplane's wings are a standard on airplanes, there might be  some exceptions for some military planes with different configurations, please correct me if I'm wrong on that part. 

When she zooms out towards the end of the video you can also see some kind of tower in the background and I would believe that the airplanes are located as far back as that tower. That's why she can't hear the airplanes. 

[Here is a map](http://imgur.com/ywQdNYM) I've made to show the approximate location of the airport and where I believe the airplanes are located and headed.

Also notice how zoomed in she is with the camera, that and the low light makes everything come out with a light trail in her pics at the end of the video. 

Regarding the other lights in the video, the same applies, it's just airplanes coming in for landing or taking off. 

The nightvision makes it look like there's only one point of light when in reality the airplanes are so bright (for the nightvision) it shows the lights as one source. 

It also looks like the light ""bleeds"" on the trees during the nightvision, which also makes it look like the objects are in front of them and closer to the camera, that's just lensflares and as soon as the light goes behind the trees it disappears.

6435,"I would have made it so that the player chooses what to do with them. 

* If I give them a weapon they should stay and fight. But just to show that there's a bigger risk involved they could've made it so they have less HP and can die a bit easier, but it still up to me, the overseer, to assess the situation. There's obviously a timer set to the pregnancy in the game, so there could be a bigger risk of them dying later on in the pregnancy than right in the beginning of pregnancy.

* If a fire breaks out they stay and help to put it out (If I'm a caring overseer I would of course get her out of the room to protect her and the baby and get someone else in there).

* If they don't have a weapon they leave the room, but not the damsel-in-distress-mode they are shown to act like in the game now, as I described above.

I think that this would make me care more about them and might be a bigger challenge for me as a player. Instead of them automatically running out in every situation I would need to assess each situation and think about the risks involved of the woman and the baby she's carrying.

I would also make it so that everyone even though carrying a weapon would have a certain chance of panicking and running out of the room in case of incident. Maybe if the dweller has a low level of Strength, Charisma or Intelligence they might have a bigger chance of getting panic. Just to spice up the gameplay a bit.

By making all women act as damsels in distress just because they're pregnant sends out a signal to people who won't know better that all pregnant women behave like that in an emergency situation. EDIT: Especially to little kids who will play the game.

Who knows maybe they did that because of a technical limitation or the game director maybe didn't even think about it but none the less, it can give people the wrong idea about how people behave in emergencies.

An example of how this was treated better was in Mad Max Fury Road and how the movie showed how Splendid helped out even though she was pregnant.

Eh, nightly raids happened all over Europe all the time and anti-aircraft defense was immense. The Battle of LA was an unusual occurrence in the US because not that many attacks happened on US soil.

Here's one example of what lead up to the [Battle of LA](http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-attacks-on-u-s-soil-during-world-war-ii) and why everyone was on edge.

&gt;The Bombing of Ellwood Oil Field

&gt; After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, a small contingent of Japanese submarines was dispatched east to patrol the California coastline. On February 23, 1942, the Japanese submarine I-17 slinked into a channel near Ellwood Oil Field, a large oil well and storage facility outside of Santa Barbara. After surfacing, the submarine lobbed 16 shells at Ellwood Beach from its lone deck gun before submerging and fleeing to the open ocean.
&gt; 
&gt; The brief shelling only caused minor damage to the oil field—a pump house and a single oil derrick were destroyed—but its implications were severe. The bombardment at Ellwood was the first shelling of the mainland United States during World War II, and it sparked an invasion panic among an American populace not used dealing with war on the home front. A day later, reports of enemy aircraft led to the so-called “Battle of Los Angeles,” in which American artillery was discharged over Los Angeles for several hours due to the mistaken belief that the Japanese were invading.

But I would like to add that I agree with that conclusion but that the video probably has been heavily edited by the creator of the video. 

I think he has shot a bird with its baby birds and duplicated them so it appears that it's tons of objects coming from the ""motherbird"". 

When the UFO ""slows down"" it's most obvious that this is just a bird flapping its wings. Then it cuts to two pairs of ""orbs"" flying around the object and this looks way to CGI. Maybe the original video had two baby birds flying next to the mother but the movements the new pairs does is way to unnatural. 

After that the video shows ""the fleet"" which is also nothing unusual but just looks like a couple of birds in the sky. 

The black objects in video 2, I think it's done using the same technique even though it states that it's a different author of the vid.
