Everything happened 3 years ago, 3 days after I managed to get a driving license.

02:00 AM of a cold February. We were 7 guys, splitted into 2 cars.

In my car we were three: Me, ""Mike"" and the subject of one of the funniest moments of my life, ""Frank"".
After eating a pizza, we went for a walk into one of the nearby parks. After a long walk, we decided to just chill into our cars, talking about random things.
02:30 AM - 
Frank leaves the car while talking to us, about one of his crushes and I notice something strange: he was sweating, a lot ( with 3 degrees ??! ). 
Me: ""Man, are you feeling alright?""
Frank: ""Yeah, I just needed some air."". 

He comes back in.

02:45 AM - 
Frank says: ""Guys, I need to poo.""
Me: ""Well, I don't think there are any bathrooms nearby; also, the ones in the park are probably locked now.""
Frank: ""I'll have a look"".

03:30 AM

Me: ""Yo Mike, where's the fuck he his?""
Mike: ""Here he comes back, finally - I'm freezing"".

*Frank comes next to my car, pale as hell.*

Me: ""So, you managed to do it? What took you so long?""
Frank: ""Dude, I think I've shit myself."".
*I wanted to drown in my own laughs*
Me: ""Wait, what? What do you mean?""
Frank: ""I don't know - the park maindoor was locked and I had to climb over it. When I landed, i blasted in my pants.""

Me and Mike start crying about this, while the other guys were thinking about what we were talking about.

Frank: ""Bro the fuck are you laughing about? I'm a mess !""
Me: ""Come on, use these soaked handkerchiefs""

03:40

Me: ""Already done?""
Frank: ""Yeah, i tossed away my boxers - sorry if I've used all the handkerchiefs. Can you see if you smell anything funny?

*Once he turned his back to me, I smelled death. Pure and simple death.*

Me: ""Nah, you're alright - you smell like apples. Anyway, you're moving along with David's car?"".
Frank: ""Yeah, he's on the same way where my home is.""
Me: ""Alright, cool - see you around man."".

When Frank got into David's car, we could hear their muffled screams:

"" WHAT THE - BHWAAAAAAAAAAAAA "".

The place was distant 20 minutes from home.

Totally agree about not playing while driving.

179,"Today I had my first ""Walk session"" and it was going very well. After some rattatas and pidgeys, signed as 2 steps  further - Scyther ( One of my FAVOURITE Pokémons ). I start checking every direction to find out which One was the right One. After crossing a bit of forest anf highroad i manage to get so close that no footsteps are signed under him. Watching around me, i see only one place possibile: a church. I rushed into the yard and finally he happeared. After 5 pokeballs i manage to get him! Rated 202 CP. Once i ended the fight with also a loud ""FUCK YEAH"", I clearly see a bunch of kids with their parents and the Priest ( probably they were having a meeting of some sort ). Ranned away while their parents yelled at me. 10/10 would swear in church again.

Beware - this is not an attack to you, ThadeusOfNazereth, but I'm just saying that e-cigarettes don't explode if are well conserved and used. Remember: Always buy original items from original retailers - VAPE SAFE!",2016-06-23 15:50:08+00:00,d4kwqyk,,t1_d4ckx3x,,TellMeAFact
