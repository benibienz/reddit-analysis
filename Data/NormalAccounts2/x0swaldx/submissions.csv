As I mentioned in the title, I wanna swap class trying to possibly find a fresh one, different from those I usually played.

Back in the days:

- I mained a Warrior ( WoTLK, Cata );

-  I came back in WoD with a Shaman and now I levelled an Unholy DK.

As you can see, they're mainly melee classes, since I kinda hated, at the time, ranged or ""turret"" classes.

I loved the idea to bashing into a pack of mobs and destroy them, being a tanky class too but that could say it's own thing damage speaking.

I stopped playing for almost 2 months and I feel that a ranged class couldn't hurt, since I wanna try to find a solo class.

Here's my thoughts:

- I wanna try something different from the classic melee, kinda go ranged or something (not sure) but I'm opened to suggestions

- I wanna DPS

- Make my stand ALSO as a solo player

THANK YOU for reading this, hoping to find the right class for me.


TL:DR - Always been a melee player, ready to swap for a ranged too DPS wise - tips?

I've finally decided to get a move on.

It's been one week of NoFap. But I wanna tell you why I started it.

I work 10 hours a day, until 8:30 PM in this travel agency from 2 years and, despite the stress and the concentration you need, I like it a lot and I do pretty good with strangers. Once I get home, I feel kinda tired, but more of like ""Nah man, today I'm just chillin' here"".
My day ends with me on Netflix or on Skype with some ""online pals"", sometimes even watching together something or play bunch of things. Every. Single. Day.

Except the Saturdays.

I have some friends, don't get me wrong. But more the days goes by, the more I feel like I shouldn't be there.

During this loop, I started feeling some anger, sadness - probably something closer to depression.

Do the math: sadness, ""lonelyness"", boredom - Fap.

It became some kind of routine, I did it one time every week, depending on how shitty I felt.
I did it, despite the fact that I felt more shitty once I ended the ""session"".

The problem in all of this was porn, more than the fap itself.
Last week I said:"" Enough, I can't do this anymore."".

A good sign is that a girl wants to see me and now I must arrange something cool without getting eating from anxiety and zero libido. ( any tips? 'cause I simply suck. ).

First of all - enjoying the expansion? 'Cause i'm friggin' loving it!

Anyway - let's cut to the chase: my Unholy DK's DPS.

I'm at level 110 with a global item level of 838 ( weapon 859 ).
During every dungeon (and yesterday in the raid) my friends and other guild members mocked me about my dps.

Felt kinda bad honestly - I didn't imagine that kind of ""toxic"" from them. My DPS went, during the different runs, from 150k to a maximum of 175k, noticing that I usually run out of Runes, having 2-3 seconds of ""autoattacks"" where everything is on CD or I don't have enough Runes.

Here's my rotation on single target:

- Cast Virulent Plague;

- I use Dark Transformation;

- Usually, I cast my gargoyle and then proceed with 2 Festering Strike, trying to reach 6-8 Virulent Plagues;

- Cast Soul Reaper
- Use the Artifact Spell Apocalypse to pop all the Festering Wound and benefit from the S.R. haste

- Start from the beginning, refreshing Virulent Plague when ends, using Dark Transformation when avaiable and applying stacks of Festering Wound with Festering Strike, proceeding with the scourge strikes to pop them.

During the rotation, i Deplete all my runic power with Death Coil to regen some energy for my Abomination.


Here are my talents instead:

- Bursting Sores

- Pestilent Pustules

- Castigator or Clawing Shadows ( usually the 2nd )

- Sludge Belcher

- Corpse Shield

- Necrosis ( since scourge strike it's my main damage font )

- Soul reaper.


For Multipel targets I run the same setup, using Death and Decay and the Scourge Strike combo for the multiple hits bonus.

What do you guys think? Any advice for single and multiple talents/rotations?

 I really need your help lads in order to improve and be a better DPS.

Thank you all!


EDIT: Thanks to all the tips guys - now I'm achieving 200k !

- Reinstallation of World of Warcraft;

- I got no addons;

- Deleting WTF, Cache and Interface folders;

- NVIDIA user, go the latest drivers released on the 15th of August 2016;

- Resetting the bios to its default settings only increased my CPU temps, reaching 65°C of core temps ( limit should be 62 ) and didn't change anything performance wise. So I decreased the voltage again and removed all the Power Saving features.

- Settings ALL WAY to low, except Textures to High and Distances, Ground Clutter etc. set to 6.


The main problems it's on big fights - I simply can't stay to at least 60 FPS - I don't need 100 or more, 60 is enough.

Warrior Arms and Shaman Enhancement.

I really loved these classes, much different but they hit very hard. The main thing they have in common is that they're both melee classes - well, Shaman has a lot of ranged shocks and spells, but still remains a melee.


I haven't watched a lot of videos of the new changes, just a few minutes of both classes, but I really can't decide the class that I will end doing.


I always went for a melee type class because i really like smashing something into someone's face, lol.

I'm open to changes, tho'! So here's the thing:

- I've mained melee classes, but I'm willing to change;

- I love being a kind of off-tank, with decent damage and a bit of survability;

- Usually I've been a DPS;

- Love the teamwork when needed, but usually I'm a lonewolf.
