Reminds me of a funny game i once had. i won the game as carry antimage with 2 kills and 13 deaths. got flamed all game and at the end i was reported for ""not having any kills and feeding"". then i responded ""but i have 700 last hits and a higher gpm then all of you and i was the one to kill all of their rax and ancient."" and then i got laughed at.",2016-05-19 19:03:02+00:00,d3byige,5.0,t1_d3boq8y,12664.0,DotA2

If you give dark souls a bit of time you'll soon find out how much easier the game is then people say. it took me 30 hours to finish dark souls 1 40 hours for dark souls 2 and 20 hours for dark souls 3 (i missed all the optional bosses though)
