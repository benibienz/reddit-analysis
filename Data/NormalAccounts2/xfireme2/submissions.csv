The battle cup is really good and with some slight adjustements could become even better (These are all my opinion and you can disagree):

I would like to see battle cup be instead of a BO1 become a BO3. and i would like it to be 2 times a week instead of once a week.

The battle pass itself i think is fine but i would love it if they made the community challenges more consistent and fun next time. but maybe someone can tell me of something that could be improved to change my mind.

I am just saying buff midlane so that roamers wont be as annoying as they are. my suggestion would just be nerf riki bounty and maybe move towers up a small bit?

Edit: So many people are completely overreacting and exaggerating what i am saying. i am not saying nerf roaming too much. just a little bit. small nerfs to make it not as effective as it is currently. i am not saying that i hate roaming because i am bad but because it is boring to play against every single game.
