Here is reasons why I love Dida Ritz and think you should too.

2. Should have won Queens behind bars and maybe even Dragazines.

3. Was hilarious in Snatch Game.

4. Had among the top 3 best lip syncs of all time!

5. Even held her own in her lip sync against Latrice.

6.  Her instagram is gorgeous.
