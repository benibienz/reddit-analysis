102,"Red Octobers, tell her that I (Urbantrends718, my IG and YouTube ) sent you and you'll pay $350 on them from perfectkicks. Just posted in this other thread about them. The 750 boosts I'm unsure of how much she'll take off , but she'll definitely hook you up with the discount on them. I just posted a little bit about my experience buying from here in another thread , it has my pics and video review in it.

103,"Nice review Dallo. I was going to post my review of the red Octobers on here today, but you beat me to the punch lol. I answered a few questions yesterday about perfectkicks, since there were multiple threads going on about them. This was my first time purchasing from them , so I was hesitant at first, but I was glad everything worked out . Kim was easy to deal with, customer service was on point . Perfectkicks ships their orders in sequence (first come, first serve ).  Once my order did ship, they shipped via DHL which took 4 days. I did a video review on my red Octobers and it's difficult to pickup the accurate color reds on camera.  But overall I'm satisfied with the quality on them. This is the closest I'll get to a retail pair without paying the insane resale price. I pre-ordered the yeezyboost 350s and DM'd me a pic of what my size 10 would look like. Repsneakers fam, I mentioned in my review vid, that if you tell Kim that I ( Urbantrends718,  that's my YouTube/ IG) sent you , she will give you a discount (red Octobers would be $350 shipped). Sorry, Dallo to takeover your post, but I didn't want to clutter the forum with another thread .  Here is my video review:
