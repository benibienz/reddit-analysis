&gt;Thank you for selling on Amazon.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;The Selling on Amazon team

161,"Perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my other comments.  I've never missed a payment on my credit cards and have always made at least the minimum payment. In the past 10 years I have missed two payments (once to my cell company because they didn't email me a bill and once to my Internet provider which I just forgot to pay). 

I am currently using the snowball method to pay my debt. I only have one credit card with an outstanding balance and 3 different government student loans which I make the minimum payment on. All of my extra money goes towards this card. 

Finally, I do have a separate credit card that I am using as you suggested. I make multiple purchases on it a month and pay it roughly every two weeks.

 It is not a cash only lifestyle I am after, it is one where I make smart choices about the debt I decide to take on (paying for pizza 20 times over 5 years later is not smart debt). ",2015-07-24 19:06:41+00:00,ctewe7z,2.0,t1_cteu1tt,3489.0,PersonalFinanceCanada

163,"I tried this years ago with no luck, but I was likely just talking to the wrong person. 

I'm not going to make the same mistakes I've made in the past and go into credit card debt again. Most of the charges were simply made while unemployed or underemployed.  These were daily expenses, when you have no job daily trips to the corner store for $5 worth of pop and snacks and a $20 pizza for supper add up way faster than you would think. 

I wasn't smart, I thought I could just pay it off later and now I pay over $200 a month in interest because old me was stupid. Now I am living within my means and if I don't have the cash then it doesn't get purchased. ",2015-07-23 19:01:37+00:00,ctdocsd,2.0,t1_ctdnw7y,668.0,PersonalFinanceCanada

Another stupid question, what's the difference between a personal loan and a line of credit? 

I'm guessing a personal loan they give you the money once and you pay it back whereas a line of credit you can borrow multiple times as long as you pay it back (basically the same as a credit card)? ",2015-07-23 17:30:36+00:00,ctdkhlt,6.0,t1_ctdkb7h,251.0,PersonalFinanceCanada
