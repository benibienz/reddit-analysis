I like Conspiracy 2 more than Conspiracy 1 because Council's Dilemma is alot better this time around. The draft itself It is an 8 player draft, 4 player game, and bounty style prizes (when you are out of the game, the last opponent who dealt damage gets a pack).

TL;DR: Summoner’s Bond and Natural Unity are really good.

Here’s the state of the game.

Planeswalker One (WUg) is blessed with a Hymn of the Wilds on his quest for the crown. His first supporter comes as a Ballot Broker, allowing for an additional vote during council meetings. Next come the Messenger Jays, to spread the word - he votes twice for bigger feathers while everyone else votes quills to allow him to draw from his library. Surprise! A Summoner’s Bond pulls forth an Orchard Elemental - he votes twice for bigger sprouts while everyone else votes harvest to give him a bountiful 9 life points. They chain over the turns and he ends up with a formidable air force (three 4/3 flyers) and ground force (three 6/6 beatsticks). He has dug 9 cards deep and sits in a safe ivory tower with 47 life points. 

Planeswalker Two (GWb) has a menagerie of creatures and starts with a Wings of the Guard. Surprise! He also has a Summoner’s Bond and brings forth Netcaster Spiders. The board fills with more birds, spiders, Ravenous Leucrocota, and the Menagerie Liberators. Second surprise! The spiders are imbued with Natural Unity and they begin to grow every turn.

Planeswalker Three (UGb) also has an air force in addition to a severe case of crabs. Three Skittering Crustaceans hold the ground and eventually become monstrous, in addition to a pair of Nessian Asps. Leading the team is an Animus of Predation that is imbued with flying, lifelink, menace, and deathtouch. Making matters worst, the Animus gets bigger every turn via Natural Unity and eats several more creatures through Prey Upon. Planeswalker Three fears the huge spiders of Planeswalker Two, and he cannot attack Planeswalker One, because One has made a Pariah out of the Animus.

Planeswalker Four (RB) lacks an air force and is only supported by a small band of troops that are outclassed by all the monstrous threats surrounding him. However, his best defense is having no defense. He sits at a precarious 10 life, but no one dares to attack him. No one can take him out in one shot without leaving themselves vulnerable. No one can wittle his life lower, because someone else can swoop in for the kill. He is aware of his hopeless predicament, and the best he can do is continue to torment everyone. He goads our creatures into attacking his enemies. He forces us to pay taxes in blood through Capital Punishment. We accept the punishment that he continues to dish out.

Suddenly, the monarch reveals himself and a Skyline Despot comes to aid Four. Fearing a future army of dragons, everyone begins to mobilize. The appearance of the monarch broke the hostile peace.

One surprises everyone despite his Hymn of the Wilds, by suddenly doubling his air force in a flash with a spontaneous army of Cloaked Sirens. The flying team attempt to strike down Four, and the Skyline Despot is not enough to defend the monarch. On the verge of death, a Kill Shot is fired by Two to strike down one of the sirens! Four is saved!

The kindness of Two covers his greed for the bounty on his enemy’s heads. Two uncovers a Rogue Passage and sends a monstrous Leucrocota down the tunnels to assassinate Four. Two collects the first Bounty.

One, Two, Three remain.

One finds himself in his lofty ivory tower with bountiful health, but he sits on the verge of mental exhaustion due to a dwindling library. On the eve of One’s death, Two takes a final shot by sending the hungry Leucrocota through the Rogue Passage. Three also takes a shot at One with a lonely Vaporkin to draw the last blood. Suddenly, the Vaporkin erupts into a mist and an elephant appears. Two had summoned the Beast Within the Vaporkin to ensure that Two had drawn the last blood on One. 

One falls into a mental abyss after exhausting all his resources far sooner than the others from his love of bird quills. Two collects another Bounty.

Two and Three remain.

As monarch, Two finds himself burning through resources and drawing down his mental library while dealing with the threat of a growing number of monsters on his doorstep. Two bolsters his defenses by summoning more creatures and the Nessian Asps fall under Ghostly Possession.

Eventually, Two’s huge Netcaster Spider starts to fit himself in the Rogues Passage on the way to ambush Three. However, several times, the spider is foiled by a Deceiver Exarch. It looks like Two will not be able to kill Three in time.

On the verge of collapsing in mental exhaustion, Two remembers one last spell in his arsenal. “You want to know your enemy, look at your feet when you trample him.” Two collects the third and finally bounty and emerges victorious!

The game is basically a simulation where you build and run a prison – think of it as a dark version of Rollercoaster Tycoon. Instead of a theme park, you’re housing inmates and taking care of their needs (or not).

Anyways! I give a tour of the video game prison in my YouTube video below (the first six minutes of the video). I’d love to hear any feedback on if I am missing any features of the prison, so I can incorporate them into future additions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Ox6vFgQ90

Thanks, and hope you enjoy the work! (Took about 4 hours to build the prison in the game. I also instigate a riot and talk about the game features in later portions of the video.)

I wish I was creating my first Reddit post under happier circumstances, but my friend suggested I post here.

Long story short - A home robbery resulted in cards being stolen (along with other non-magic related property). I do not believe the thieves specifically targeted magic cards, they just grabbed a box of valuables. I doubt I will ever see anything again, but I'm hoping the thieves can be caught at least to prevent future robberies.

In the Philadelphia area, please be on the lookout for anyone suddenly trying to sell: Black Lotus, Mox Jet, Mox Pearl, Ancestral Recall, 4x Tundra, 4x Underground Sea, 4x Volcanic Island, 3x Tropical Island, 2-3x Bayou, 2-3x Badlands, 2-3x Plateau, 8x Wasteland, Fetches

I'm not sure what other information I'm allowed to post on Reddit, but let me know if more information is needed.

Thank you so much,
J

Edit 12/22/15: Thank you everyone for all the help and feedback. I've always been proud to be part of the great Magic community. If the thieves are caught, I hope to give back to the community in some way. Hope everyone has a good holiday.",magicTCG,Stolen Vintage Collection-Philadelphia,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3xidwh/stolen_vintage_collectionphiladelphia/
