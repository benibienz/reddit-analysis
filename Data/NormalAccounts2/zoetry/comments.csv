0,"I was told the background check could take up to 10 business days, but to cautiously expect it to be done in just three days.

I got called for orientation on the second business day after my interview.

As /u/KarmaG12 mentioned, management likes to do orientation in groups, so that they don't waste the trainer's time; so, you're likely waiting for them to clear enough applicants to build an orientation group.

However, since it's monday, I'm guessing your interview was wednesday, which would mean that the background check company has only had your app for three business days, or just a third of the maximum advised waiting period. 

If your interview really was on wednesday, I'd wait until friday to give your store a call, since that would put the wait at 7 business days. ",2016-10-31 15:49:28+00:00,d9fgjs4,1,t3_5abd28,22141,walmart

58,"&gt;As of now, there is only one thing missing from the core set of properties I set out to achieve: protection against attacks to the network. This encompasses two main problems: Sybil attacks, and spam. Note that this is not related to the attack against persons using the network, the entire system is designed to prevent that.

&gt;The current solution I am thinking about against both of these problems are, in essence, implementations of proofs-of-work. I welcome comments about the soundness of such a system described below—if you are seeing any holes, I would be glad to hear about it.

&gt;####Sybil attacks

&gt;The Sybil attack, in this context, means a malicious user creating hundreds or thousands of nodes (Sybils) to have more votes than he or she is allowed. This can be used to push posts into popularity by upvoting, or for the reverse, to bury others by downvoting.

&gt;The solution I have found to prevent this issue is to make creation of any significant amount of nodes prohibitively expensive in terms of processing power. At the creation the node hashes its key a certain user-definable number of times. This communicates to others that the node has exerted a certain amount of effort to prove that it is legitimate. Users pick a threshold above which they deem acceptable enough to interact with, and only accept connections from nodes that can prove spending that effort.

&gt;####Spam

&gt;Spam is ubiquitous, but what it means in this context is a flood of unwarranted messages to either create a DDoS attack on the network, or to harass people with messages they do not want.

&gt;To prevent spam, my plan is to implement a similar proof-of-work which communicates to the receiver that the creator of that post did a certain amount of work to prove that the post was not mass-produced. The idea is the same: to make creation of hundreds or thousands of posts cost-prohibitive.

That's still a considerable claim, in that it supposes that all things can be known, given our track record for knowing things.

This doesn't make sense to me. It would seem that you're saying that we'll only know whether a thing was truly knowable or not once we can watch the reruns.

There are phenomena that we currently know about that have never been explained, as far as we know. At what point do we assume that they cannot be explained with logic and science? i.e. How long do we have to know about a thing until we arrive at that one day that we decide it's been long enough to say that it is undeterminable?

That's not true. This would go a long way toward improving phone based VR. 

You also seem to be assuming that this technology is being developed exclusively for and will only have an impact on phones. It isn't and won't.

&gt; The existing screens are good enough

Maybe for you, but not in general. We've still got a long way to go in color reproduction, black levels, refresh times, energy consumption, flexibility, etc for screens to start looking like reality.

&gt; our eyes can only see so many pixels.

Sure, but we're nowhere near that limit.

&gt; We don't need better and denser smartphone screens.

We don't actually need more than 64kb of RAM, either. It's just useful in certain use cases, just like higher PPIs are.

&gt;Funding put towards it should go towards other areas of smartphone improvement instead.

Dumping money into specific research domains doesn't magically increase the progress of that domain. 

For what it's worth, Tesla is already pouring billions into battery design and manufacturing that is applicable to smartphones.
