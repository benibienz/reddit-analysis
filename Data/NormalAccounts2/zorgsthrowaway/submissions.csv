I'm majoring in Econ with a good GPA. I'm also involved in a couple clubs, and play a club sport. I have a good group of friends and everything seems to be going well but for some reason I'm unhappy.  I constantly think about transferring because I don't really like it here. Hardly anybody seems to care about academics and there isn't much to do outside of the college itself.

I don't feel like I am being challenged in my classes even though I am interested in what I am studying. I hated the winter semester last year because all of my friends go skiing and I hate the snow and the cold, so I am left alone. I've also been thinking about transferring because my school doesn't have exactly what I want academically and I would like better internship opportunities. Even with the clubs I am involved with on campus, I constantly feel bored and like I would rather be somewhere else. Basically I just feel like I picked the wrong school. Does anybody have advice on transferring? Are these good reasons to transfer?
