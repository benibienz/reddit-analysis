46,"&gt; John Key is a political grandmaster 

Let's be realistic here. Key is, at best, an awkward man who is uncomfortable talking off the cuff and has had fortunate windfalls. 

* He has money, and money can buy gold-class PR advice, which mean you don't have to think hard when the cameras are on. Just stick to the script and all is fine.

* The media here is even more powerless, staffed by spineless yes-men who are more interested in clicks than in reporting, and entirely uninterested in journalism than most other English-speaking nations. This makes it even easier to get away with scripted sound-bites when you know not one mainstream voice will question you, and even if they do, you can easily exploit the fickle ADD of the news cycle to ignore it because there will be no on-going investigations. 

* The population who votes, and who get their political news from this same media, also aren't bothered by how things are. Most of them benefit from it, whether you're an Auckland property investor or a dairy farmer. Everything is fine, or at least looks fine, for them. That rosy outlook means any problems they do encounter aren't due to them and the things they like (which means Key and his National government). No one gives away their golden egg, and there is no incentive to look to the effects of this way of thinking on future generations or the long-term stability of the nation as a whole. 

* The opposition is so embarrassingly weak and ineffectual that the popularity of an awkward banker who has to buy coaching and rely on having lucked into a crippled media and receptive voting demographic in order to have a semblance of popularity (which he still has to pay for), and in other times and places would be highly unpopular, continues to stump them. This is one part due to a constant need to define themselves as *against John Key* rather than pushing a strong positive vision, and one part because they have even less of a grasp of the media and how to generate favorable public sentiment than a stiff banker who had to buy his popularity. This leaves them both unable to generate any positive movement and wide open to Key's counters.

An actual grandmaster would wipe the floor with Key, much the way Trump has cleaned house in the US against people who are cut from the same milquetoast cardboard. Key is a big fish in small backwater, who has paid for big-ticket PR coaching and been fortunate enough to exploit it in a slew of favorable circumstances. If Labour wants to attack Key in a way that sticks, they need to get a better grip on what moves voters and how to leverage the media to make use of that knowledge.",2016-05-16 08:19:33+00:00,d379u73,2.0,t1_d376hi6,10605.0,newzealand

107,"If the Wikipedia's ideological trolling and the Redditor's favourite hashing out over the dictionary meanings of words weren't enough to convince you, at least a bastion of sanity in the American College of Pediatricians says [Gender Ideology Harms Children](http://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children):

&gt;**1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: “XY” and “XX” are genetic markers of health – not genetic markers of a disorder.** The norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. This principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.


&gt;**3. A person’s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.** When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V).5 The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.


&gt;**8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.** Endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to “gender clinics” where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will “choose” a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.",2016-04-07 10:35:30+00:00,d1tcv78,7.0,t1_d1tbu2b,3815.0,newzealand

151,"&gt;Left-wingers generally oppose the TPPA, especially the pro-big biz and fuck-everyone-else parts.

For this to be true requires a serious mangling of the left-right spectrum as it is ordinarily defined. In loosest terms the Left is revolutionary and progressive, they want to change and transform existing institutions. The Right wishes to preserve them. 

What passes for the left-right spectrum in recent NZ politics is closer to a doctrinal dispute among revolutionary progressives about what kind of radical change is for the best. The left-wingers you refer to want redistribution of wealth for what they take as the collective social good. 

The pseudo-right of the National Party wants to enact transformation by eroding the existing social and cultural institutions in favor of a politically borderless and economically homogenous global order centered on the interests of elites, mainly in the US and the UK. This is a very recent development, since the 1980s and 90s, and it coincides with the predominance of neoconservative policies in Western nations, which assimilated a revision of classical economic liberalism (""neoliberalism""). This is ""right-wing"" only in name, and it undermines the division into right and left to begin with.

Transsexuals commit suicide at roughly the same rates before and after transitioning, and in some studies at even higher rates after surgery. That suggests that the problem is not in being ""repressed"" or even bullied or otherwise mistreated.

Preaching acceptance becomes conversion when children who may experience normal feelings of curiosity or confusion are told they are transsexuals and placed on chemical therapies.

167,"&gt;Discussion over the extent to which policies should protect values such as race and culture is a massive and largely separate topic, so let's set that aside. The TPP will have hardly any effect on these anyway, since it barely touches immigration policy.

This way of thinking is exactly the problem I'm referring to. You think you can neatly analyze all of these matters into categories that suit your way of looking at the world. 

You still haven't understood why the TPPA is a problem largely because it is symptomatic of a larger set of processes, and you can't or won't see that because of this blinkered way you insist on looking at matters. It's all neat categories.

It is exactly this problem, in the quoted bit about values and culture and community, that we have to face, and it's exactly that which you want to ""set aside"", as if that's a possibility. It isn't, not for you, not for anyone. These are not separable into the neat categories you need it to analyze into. ",2016-01-21 09:05:03+00:00,cz6bo5e,11.0,t1_cz6bflo,898.0,newzealand

Sturgis is an interesting case because he acknowledges that there is a negative effect on trust and cohesion, but in good apparatchik fashion he is also far more interested in explaining this relative to control for economic factors. This is tantamount to saying that once you control for massive skull trauma, getting shot in the head isn't positively correlated with injury. 

It's also ignoring the bare evidence that human beings prefer their own, aren't suited to mass society and the erosion of social bonds that it brings, and generally do not like being forced to be around people who aren't part of their local community.

If you can't walk into a shop in your own country and interact with the people running it because they haven't and likely won't learn the language, that's a problem that affects your community, erodes trust, and contributes however slightly to hostility.
