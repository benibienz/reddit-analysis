Be real. This is not a one on one affair. there were cops. not a cop. warnings made to a madman to stop running? that man could have been kicked once in the face and that was all. Did the mad man run towards people on the streets to kill them? Ha its funny when you talk like that rewatch the video again man. Atleaaaast a shot in the leg!!!!! common u want me to believe that running guy was in a kill chase? sometimes you know we gotta be real. For me that killing was so uncalled for. And its wrong to defend them thinking about them risking their lives.

99,The cops could have gotten the earrings off without necessarily tasering her. shes goddamn old for Christ sake. there were other officers around. couldn't they just handcuff her and get the earrings off? i think tasering her to fall (break arm) was just too lame. arent cops trained to act better in such situations (with old women) than to just tase after after a little resistance. she obeyed all instructions till the point of taking off her jewels. i just dont get this as a being a procedure man. Its seriously lame. Like cops are trained to shoot and tase and thats all... common guys!! ,2016-05-24 14:41:27+00:00,d3hqmm0,4.0,t1_d3hq6dv,654.0,Tennessee

150,i understand. There is the opposite side of everything we do. the fact is when students get access to the internet in class obviously do well in class tests because they can have access to the answers to questions (google). But when its examination time and digital devices are not allowed they are found wanting. Most students and i repeat MOST student misuse digital devices in class and we need not to argue. very little or few actually get to use their devices effectively. ,2016-05-12 13:56:22+00:00,d32nvzm,2.0,t1_d32nd46,808.0,education

310," 1. Start Small - Start with something you can do immediately and easily. When we start with small successes, we build momentum to gain more confidence in our abilities.
2. Create a Compelling Vision - Use the power of your imagination. Create an image of yourself as the confident and self-assured person you aspire to become. 
3. Socialize - Get out of the house or setup a lunch date with a friend. Socializing with others will give us opportunities to connect with other people, and practice our communication and interpersonal skills. 
4. Do Something that Scares You - As with all skills, we get better with practice and repetition. The more often we proactively do things that scare us, the less scary these situations will seem, and eventually will be rid of that fear.
5. Do Something You Are Good At - What are you especially good at or enjoy doing? Regularly doing things that you are good at reinforces your belief in your abilities and strengths. I (Tina) can be very efficient with completing errands or administrative work.
6. Set Goals - According to a study done at Virginia Tech, 80% of Americans say they don’t have goals. And the people who regularly write down their goals earn nine times as much over their lifetime as people who don’t.
7. Help Others Feel Good About Themselves - Help somebody or teach them something. When you help other people feel better about themselves and like themselves more, it will make you feel good about yourself. 
8. Get Clarity on Life Areas - Get clarity on the life area that needs the most attention. Your self-esteem is the average of your self-concept in all the major areas of your life. Write down all the major categories of your life, e.g., health, relationships, finance, etc. 
9. Create a Plan - Having a goal alone won’t do much. Get clarity on your action items. One of the biggest reasons people get lazy is because they don’t have a plan to achieve their goals. 
10. Get Motivated - Read something inspirational, listen to something empowering, talk to someone who can uplift our spirits, who can motivate us to become a better person, to live more consciously, and to take proactive steps towards creating a better life for ourselves and our families.
11. Get External Compliments - As funny as this point suggests, go find a friend or family member and ask them “What do you like about me?” “What are my strengths?” or “What do you love about me?” We will often value other people’s opinions more than our own.
12. Affirmations &amp; Introspection - Use affirmations, but in the right way. Some people think that when they’re in a slump, using positive affirmations will help them get out of it. I love affirmations, but I’ve realized you have to use them in the right way. 
13. No More Comparisons - Stop comparing yourself to other people. Low-self esteem stems from the feeling of being inferior. For example, if you were the only person in the world, do you think you could have low-self esteem? Self-esteem only comes into the picture when there are other people around us and we perceive that we are inferior.  ",2016-04-22 13:41:14+00:00,d2d0wlr,1.0,t3_4fygk8,485.0,AskReddit
