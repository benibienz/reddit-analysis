For example, several times I've noticed calls to raise kids as genderless from the very early age. Indeed, being raised in such environment eliminates all possible gender stereotypes and teaches people around that no one is assigned to a certain gender role.

However, I believe in a traditional way of raising children. I believe that in our times, there is not really much oppression regarding cis-people, and more and more is done to eradicate lgbt+ discrimination, so I sincerely feel there is no critical need to enforce genderless rhetoric only to let a baby choose which gender ""they"" would like to become.
Raising a kid genderless as a response to the society in an effort to highlight its flaws seems dumb and selfish to me.

NB: Having no proper extent, I managed to offend some people by the headline and by post itself by using an incorrect pronoun. I tried to correct the mistakes, but reddit only allows to modify the post itself. Please accept my apologies.
