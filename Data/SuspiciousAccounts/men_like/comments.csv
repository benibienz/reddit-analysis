32,Well they shot down a Russian plane so after that accident surely Russians will be more suspicious about going to Turkey to have vocations moreover it can be prohibited by their government completely I guess.   ,2015-11-26 11:56:29+00:00,cxdmspx,1,t3_3u7oqv,81099,worldnews
33,Well agree and Russia and Turkey are on the same side in the region to shoot down planes of each other besides to down a plane is a minor thing but to kill military pilots is just a military crime I think. ,2015-11-26 11:51:28+00:00,cxdmq7b,2,t1_cxco154,71731,worldnews

But I've got a boy of my second marriage too and it occurred I didn't love my second wife so somehow I couldn't love my son either; finally we divorced and now I help them and meet my son regularly but yet there is no much love for him in my heart anyway especially in comparison to my younger daughter of my last beloved marriage.

37,I think you are right except civilians with arms cannot already be called pure civilians so I guess militants kill militants and the problem of this incident is that Russian jet was shot by Turkey which would-be    a so-called anti-ISIS coalition member too and now it's unclear who is fighting whom over there at the moment. ,2015-11-25 13:48:04+00:00,cxcjwlb,5,t1_cxcj30j,2111,worldnews

41,Very sarcastic but exactly correct and it's seems normal concerning Turkish-Russian relationship - first Russia accuses Turkey in that infamous Armenian genocide making them quite unfriendly but then Putin offers Erdogan that gas project just like they are close friends really. ,2015-11-25 12:43:09+00:00,cxcihnq,2,t1_cxbz20p,48575,worldnews
42,Partly right and surely NATO will buck up its ally Turkey but sooner or later either anti-ISIS alliance or Russia or they together will destroy oil facilities of ISIS in Syria on the other hand Putin will suspend that gas project with Turks so it'll be the double loss for them and Erdogan will have to deal with it this way or another.  ,2015-11-25 11:18:51+00:00,cxch54f,19,t1_cxcgxu9,867,worldnews
43,But now it has happened and Erdogan seems to keep silence concerning the accident and I think so makes the relationship with Russia worse although first of all it's his task to clarify the issue and make friends with Putin again.  ,2015-11-25 10:58:54+00:00,cxcgv22,17,t1_cxcglff,1154,worldnews
44,Well I think at the moment no military official can independently order to shoot down a Russian aircraft without the president confirmation because in the worst case it can mean a war and now I guess nobody wants a military conflict with Russia or China. ,2015-11-25 10:36:57+00:00,cxcgk3v,15,t1_cxcfxef,2760,worldnews
45,Really I cannot understand how altogether Erdogan could bring himself to shoot down that Russian jet just after so many peaceful and economic talks with Putin recently about all those great gas-oil projects potentially coming soon. I think Russia will answer to it correspondingly. ,2015-11-25 09:47:21+00:00,cxcfvl9,13,t1_cxcflk3,1165,worldnews
