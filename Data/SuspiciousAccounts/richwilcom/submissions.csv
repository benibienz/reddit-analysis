I'm pretty good at promoting stuff all over the internet, and now I'm looking for clients. Mostly, I promote things on imgur. It's a pretty good platform for finding buyers, getting followers, etc. I was working with some of the most popular artists on tapastic and webtoons, I was promoting Google Chrome extensions and webgames, and a lot of more projects. I can show you examples of my work.
So, I want to find some etsy shop owners to work with. Your shop will be on the front page of imgur and thousands of people will see that. No doubt, it can highly increase your sales. I can tell you details of my work, and everything you want to know about my methods.

**UPDATE #1**
Fortunately, I've found a person who started working with me inspite of lack of experience. So, I want to share results of my work with you. I made two posts and promoted both of them to the front page (I have an ability to promote posts on this site). Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/d5fBv and http://imgur.com/gallery/IWfFa. **Results of my 2-day promotion: Imgur views: 119,000+ Etsy Views: 3,410 Orders: 18 Revenue: $552.35**. Moreover, one of the posts was promoted to the ""Staff Picks"" category. Also, there were several user (4-6) who said that they would buy some items later.
