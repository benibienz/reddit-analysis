0,"Hello there, Bo! I'm the only Russian guy in this thread. I've watched your latest special yet, and I think it's pretty good. I've had a lot of fun watching it. I just want to ask you, how many your friend's jokes you use for your show? Or maybe at your specials you use only your own jokes? 

P.S. it's my birthday and your reply would be the best gift for me. Thanks in advance, Bo! ",2016-06-21 22:06:54+00:00,d4ilfve,1,t3_4p6ogb,6900,IAmA
